Karalik Lsakia nomad leader~
Karalik~
The leader of the Lsakia, Karalik, stands silently by the spring.
~
A tall, somewhat thin man, Karalik keeps a silent watch over the spring. 
Although human, his dark skin seems unnaturally rough.  His brown hair is
tied back in a short pony tail with a leather cord.  He wears the loose,
sand colored clothing of the rest of his tribe, no apparent outward mark
denoting him as leader.  Despite this, his is a commanding presence, his
brown eyes shine with a keen intensity and his slight frame seems to carry
more strength than one would expect.  

Said to be the son of a Nendorin hierophant of the druidic arts, Karalik
left his native forests for the waste.  His strength with the power of the
earth is respected among the Lsakia.  This strength, combined with his keen
mind and great courage, eventually rose him to a position of leadership
within the tribe.  Now in his middle years, Karalik sees to the ceremonial
duties of leadership as well as the more practical ones of trade.

Imirnsa tall caladaran shepherd GoatDude~
Imirnsa~
A tall caladaran with a shepherd\@s crook watches over the herd.
~
An aged caladaran, Imirnsa\@s brown hair is streaked with grey, but his
green eyes are still sharp and lucid.  Dressed in the sand-colored clothing
of the Lsakia, Imirnsa\@s similarly colored barklike skin almost blends into
it.  Standing watch over the goats, the tall caladaran guides their grazing
with soft words and gentle use of the shepherds crook he carries.  

Said to be a powerful druid, Imirnsa recently stepped down from leadership
of the Lsakia, turning the position over to Karalik.  He now spends his days
in quiet thought and relaxation as he tends the herd of the tribe.  His
retirement does not seem to have softened the caladaran, however, his body
is still well-toned and his movements graceful and quick.

say You see, not everyone does. Folks cling and claw to stability. Comfort. Nature isn\@t like that.
say An inability to let go is what creates the cities that mar Avendar\@s wilderness.
say It\@s what leads people to do fool things like attempting to gain unnatural long life, too.
say I stepped down from my leadership of the tribe not long after she left, you know. It was time for my change too.

Siyhas large srryn Lsakia~
Siyhas~
A large srryn sees to the care of the srorsians.
~
A scaly brown-green hide covers Siyhas, several shades darker than the
sand-colored clothing he wears.  A fierce warrior and a skilled hunter,
Siyhas also is charged with the training of the reptilian srorsians the
Lsakia use as pack animals.  Despite the obvious power in his frame, the
srryn is remarkably gentle to the lizards, careing for them as if brethren-
which after a fashion, they are.  

A strong templar of the flames, Siyhas is descended of a line that left
their native swamps, eventually settling in the waste.  It was the first of
these ancestors that tamed the srorsians, and the mantle of such has been
passed down from generation to generation.

A large, brown scaled lizard, the srorsian lumbers about upon four

the rest of the creature and its black eyes gaze about its surroundings in

teeth, more for cutting through grass than flesh, however.  The pack-beasts

and withstand the heat of the waste, they serve their function excellently.

Alaran monk Lsakia woman~
Alaran~
Alaran sits cross-legged here, aside a crate of wares.
~
A statuesque woman with iron gray hair and an unlined face, Alaran is an
imposing figure.  Said to have been an incredibly skilled warrior in her
youth, age as done little to take the edge off her abilities.  Her body is
well toned and her green eyes glimmer with a keen wit.  In her declining
years Alaran has taken a more mercantile focus, applying her intellect to
matters of trade.

A brown-haired goat wanders aimlessly through the waste.

Scraggly brown fur covers the goat, tangled and dust covered.  The animal
seems not to care in the least as it quietly munches on what vegetation it
can forage for.  A source of hides, milk, meat and bones for the Lsakia, the
goats are well cared for, despite what their unkempt appearance might
suggest.

A large, six-legged lizard with spines jutting from its back lies here.

The wide body of this lizard-like beast is covered in hard, stony scales
the color of sandstone.  Three pairs of squat, clawed legs propel the
basilisk with surprising speed and strength.  From its back a nest of
blackened spines grow, twitching with its every movement.  The most
arresting feature of the basilisk, however, is its head, with its great
fanged maw and gleaming yellow eyes.  Its cavernous mouth is filled with
teeth that glisten with poison.  Its eyes are a vivid yellow, arresting
those who it sets its gaze upon with petrifying magic.

Murgol~
Murgol the chaja barbarian goes about his travels.
~
A burly chaja barbarian, Murgol has been a member of the adventuring
company led by Durnark for some time.  Having escaped from the undercities
of the shuddeni, he found his way to Ashta Harrud and fell in with the Dune
Delvers looking to make enough coin to eat.  Judging by the vacant grin on
his face, he seems to enjoy his travels.

the void golem~
A metallic golem stands here, blackness seeping from the joints.
~
This large golem towers twelve feet into the air forming an imposing
humanoid figure.  It is constructed of gleaming steel, with thick plates
covering most of its body.  A chill black mist seeps from the joints where
the plates are not, settling in low, dark fog about the construct\@s feet.  A
mechanical clicking and whirring can be heard from within the golem and
grows louder when it moves.  The face of the golem is a featureless steel
mask save for a pair of dark pits where the eyes would be, sockets
reflecting nothing but absolute darkness.

a runed kopesh, \@Lrili Jiajmi\@~
A kopesh lies upon the ground, blade and handle inscribed with runes.~
An ancient symbol of the leadership of the Lsakia, \@Lrili Jiajmi\@ was
forged by caladaran scholars and druids not long after the advent of earth
magics.  Blessed with the powers of earth by the mages and forged in its
sickle-like shape by the hierophants, the sword was dubbed \@Lrili Jiajmi\@,
or Sand Dancer in the caladaran tongue.  

The kopesh itself has been passed down through the nomadic tribes of the
southern wastes for centuries.  The blade was recently passed to the templar
Karalik when the then-leader, Imirnsa, stepped down from the position.

This tartan is rough, heavily-woven strip of homespun cloth, perhaps
bjorcha-wool.  The central swath of the tartan is a deep, royal blue,
surrounded by a plaid pattern of bright red, forest green, ochre, and hints
of black.  Extra yarns, added later, it seems, compliment and elaborate the
original pattern, almost as if telling a story in some primitive, tribal
manner.  Overall, the bright, garish threads, dichotomously discordant yet
complimentary, blend well with each other, the weave strong and symbolic.  A
brighter slash of ochre, almost a yellow, zigzags crazily down the length of
the central blue stripe.  Seventeen heavy bone pins, slightly curved, are
pushed through the coarse weave.  Bloodstained, they each bear a burnt-in
\@X\@ on the wider end.  Seven thick black skeins of wool twist through one
end of the tartan.

The Dry, Cracked Plains~
Looking over the gully to the north, you can see the yellow-green spread
of the savannah.  No such verdant sprawl lies here, only cracked, sunbaked
clay.  The waste spreads south from the plains, a vast, unending carpet of
sandy brown.  The air is dry here, little moisture making it over the
western mountians whose jagged foothills impede movement.  Clouds rarely
pass through the sky overhead, and seldom remain when they do.  The puffs of
moisture are rapidly evaporated by the burning sun.  The vegetation here is
sparse, with few plants hardy enough to survive the withering heat of the
sun.  Eastward, the ground begins to become stony, making movement even more
hazardous for those not airborne.  A furrow in the desert earth is
percievable to the south, a small canyon of some sort.

The Dry, Stone-Littered Plains~
Looking over the gully to the north, you can see the yellow-green spread
of the savannah.  No such verdant sprawl lies here, only a field of
stone-littered, sunbaked clay.  The waste spreads south from the plains, a
vast, unending carpet of sandy brown.  The rocks about your feet are
reminicent of cobbling, upon further inspection, suggesting that a road once
ran through here.  Most of the stones seem artificial rather than naturally
occuring, and you even see what seems to be a large, half-buried statue in
the sands.  The rocky, quasi-ruins seem to continue to the south.

The ravine gouges nearly twenty feet into the earth.  Its bottom is sandy
but its walls are still jagged, not yet weathered by the abrasive winds of
the waste.  The ravine continues to cut south and appears to have been
created by some relatively recent earthquake.  Providing a partial haven
from the burning sun and howling winds, all manner of small insects scurry
within the rough hollows of the walls.  The ground slopes upward toward the

and pieces of granite stretch to the north and east.  A ravine cuts through
the brown wastes along the edge of the stony ruins, cutting along the
southwest borders of the ruins.  The steep drop-off seems to stop any
non-aerial movement over the gully but a crude wooden bridge allows crossing

The Dry, Stone-Littered Plains~
A field of stone-littered, sunbaked clay spreads around you, the stones
about you apparently not of natural origin.  Most of the rocks appear to
have once been the cobbling of a road running through the waste.  To the
south, the quasi-ruins continue.  A large ravine cuts a furrow to your

An Old Bridge Over the Ravine~
This old rope and board bridge spans over a large ravine.  Supported on
both ends by a pair of wooden posts, it leads to the northernside of the
canyon.  The bridge creaks with every movement, threatening to fall as aged
rope and wood strain.  The crack seems naturally formed, most likely in an
earthquake.  The bottom of the ravine, a good twenty feet down, is mostly
hidden by the shadows created by its walls.  Southward the brown plains
spread, while the bridge continues north.  More of the furrow spreads to the

deprive the waste of moisture and shade loom to the west.  The ground here
is rocky, and the western mountains grow too high and steep to be climbed. 
A furrow cuts through the foothills, turning into a trail through the
western slopes.  Stones, the remnants of a cobbled road, litter the furrow
and continue to litter the earth to the east.  Newly cleared by an
earthquake, the pass allows passage into the trails of the Mlejian
mountains.  The foothills grow steep to the south, making something of a

The Lip of a Canyon~
The cracked and sunbaked clay beneath you comes to a sudden end to the
northeast, dropping off sharply into a giant canyon.  The walls of the
opposite side, some two hundred feet away, are banded.  The striped bands
reflect dozens of earth tones.  The canyon gouges deeply into the earth. 
Its upper walls seem jagged, suggesting a formation by an earthquake, but
near the bottom the sides are smoothed.  A ribbon of water is distantly
visible running through the canyon floor.  A path winds through the waste to
the southwest.

The Dry, Cracked Plains~
The ground is uneven, consisting of cracked, sunbaked clay.  The waste
spreads about you in all directions, a vast, unending carpet of sandy brown.
The air is dry here, little moisture making it over the Mlejian mountains
that rise high in the west, their foothill blocking egress through them. 
Clouds rarely pass through the sky overhead, and seldom remain when they do.
The puffs of moisture are rapidly evaporated by the burning sun.  Little
grows here, save the occasional thorny bush or defiant tuft of brown grass. 
Northward, the ground grows even more rocky, while an encampment of some
sort can be seen to the south.

A Rutted Path Through the Waste~
This path winds through the cracked plains of the waste.  Deep ruts mark
this road, dug by years of caravan wagons carrying trade through the desert.
The air about you is dry, the moisture baked away by the fierce rays of the
sun.  Few clouds drift past the western mountains visible far to the west,
and those that do are quickly evaporated in the heat.  Vegetation is sparse,
little growing save the occasion thorny bush or defiant tuft of brown grass.
The rutted path curves east from the north as it continues.  To the
northeast a rock spire rises from the plains, eroded into its shape by the
wind and sand.

Beneath a Woolen Tarp~
A woolen tarp of dull gray stands as protection from the fierce sun of
the waste.  The cracked earth has been trod solid by the scaly feet of the
srorsians used by the Lsakia as pack animals.  A large trough, filled with
little water, serves to sate the thirsts of the reptiles.  An animal stench
of rotted meat and dung hangs thick in the air, although most of the Lsakia
seem not to notice.  The foothills of the Mlejian mountains rise up close
north and west of the canvas, making movement impossible.  Eastward the exit
from the camp is visible while the ground raises to the south somewhat,
creating a small, stony hill.

Apparently a main footpath into this encampment, the entrance is not the

To the south and west, the Lsakia encampment spreads, woolen tarps set up
for protection from the fierce sun.  Crates and bags of goods lie about the
path, awaiting transport to Ashta Harrud or northwards to Var Bandor.  The
containers hold cargo ranging from medicinal herbs to deadly venoms, the
harvest and livelihood of the tribe.  The path leads back out into the waste
to the northeast, while southwest lies the camp of the Lsakia tribe.

A Rutted Path Beneath a Stone Arch~
The deeply rutted path passes underneath a gigantic stone arch here.  The
arch seems naturally formed, weathered into its shape by countless years of
wind and sand.  Rising nearly twenty feet into the sky and spanning thirty
feet in length, the arch presents an awesome sight.  Strange marks have been
carved into the underside of the arch.  What once were, however, has long
been eroded away.  

The air about you is dry, the moisture baked away by the fierce rays of the
sun.  Few clouds drift past the western mountains visible far to the west,
and those that do are quickly evaporated in the heat.  Vegetation is sparse,
little growing save the occasion thorny bush or defiant tuft of brown grass.

Rising nearly twenty feet into the sky and spanning thirty feet in

into the reddish stone of the arch.  What they once were, however, has long

The Lip of a Canyon~
The cracked and sunbaked clay beneath you comes to a sudden end to the
east, dropping off sharply into a giant canyon.  The walls of the opposite
side, some two hundred feet away, are banded.  The striped bands reflect
dozens of earth tones.  The canyon gouges deeply into the earth.  Its upper
walls seem jagged, suggesting a formation by an earthquake, but near the
bottom the sides are smoothed.  A ribbon of water is distantly visible
running through the canyon floor.  A path winds through the waste to the
west.  Southward, the hard clay gives way to sandy plains.

Before a Small Spring~
The rocky earth gives way to the smooth stone of the foothills.  The
hills of the Mlejian mountains loom to the south and west.  Even as they
block travel, they provide something far more precious- water.  A trickle
runs down from the mountains, collecting in a small pool.  The pool is no
more than a pace or two across and is hardly a hand deep, small by any
standard.  The stony ground slopes down toward the tarps and crates of the
camp to the north and east.

Beneath a Woolen Tarp~
A woolen tarp of dull gray stands as protection from the fierce sun of
the waste.  Within the shade, several blankets are laid out over the cracked
and beaten earth, allowing one to rest more comfortably.  Small stacks of
boxes and the occasional bag lie underneath the tarp as well.  Most of the
members of the Lsakia tribe rest and sleep here in their few idle hours. 
The space is also oft-used to meet with emmisaries and discuss trade, as
well as entertain guests.  To the north, a path leads from the encampment
while eastward the tough grazing fields spread.  Westward, the ground raises
slightly, forming a small, stony hill.

Dry, Brown-Grassed Plains~
The uneven ground about you is blotched with patches of tough, brownish
grass.  The land here is uncracked, the earth apparently not baked into
hard, dry clay.  The grass grows stubbornly, obviously stunted, sunburnt and
dehydrated.  The air is dry here, little moisture making it over the
mountains looming in the west.  Clouds rarely pass through the sky overhead,
and seldom remain when they do.  The puffs of moisture are rapidly
evaporated by the burning sun.  Westward, woolen tarps provide protection
from the sun while the tough growth continues to the east and south. 
Northward, the plants rapidly thin.

Under a Rocky Overhang~
A small inlet into the foothills, the rocky walls rise up in all
directions save east.  Above you, an overhang of rock juts from the rising
mountains.  The high hills and overhang provide shade in the daytime, making
the place a haven from the burning heat of the waste.  Tufts of brown grass
grow in the sandy ground, becoming thicker as the path leads back into the
plains.  
A small opening is set into the rock to the west.

Dry, Brown-Grassed Plains~
The uneven ground about you is blotched with patches of tough, brownish
grass.  The land here is uncracked, the earth apparently not baked into
hard, dry clay.  The grass grows stubbornly, obviously stunted, sunburnt and
dehydrated.  The air is dry here, little moisture making it over the
mountains looming to the west.  Clouds rarely pass through the sky overhead,
and seldom remain when they do.  The puffs of moisture are rapidly
evaporated by the burning sun.  Southward, foothills block your egress,
although westward path leads to a small box canyon.  The tough growth
spreads to the northeast.

The chamber is large, a roughly circular construct of dark, white-veined
marble.  Six columns, each equidistant along the walls, rise, arching to
support the remains of a domed ceiling of the same material.  The walls are
cracked, and the columns likewise damaged.  The dome is partially caved in,
the stone that poured through the ancient wound covering part of a runed
arch.  Upon the walls, faded and cracked murals are carved between the
pillars, save to the south, where a massive arch opens into a passageway.

south, the path having long ago collapsed under some unknown weight.  The
cave in seems also to have carried through the floor of the passage, rending

An Ancient, Ruined Chamber~
You stand in a massive chamber of cyclopean dimensions.  Circular in
shape, walls of white veined dark marble rise into a massive, buckled dome. 
The stones of the floor radiate out in a circular mosaic, and large statues
line the edge of the room.  Each statue is that of an alatharya.  While most
are shattered and cracked, a few still stand in perfect condition.  Rubble
and debris from the walls, ceiling and the shattered statues litters the
floor.  A gigantic door stands broken on the northern wall, gilded bronze
doors hanging partially open to allow an avalanche of rubble through.  The
skeleton of a large humanoid lies nearby the doors, long since decayed.  

A fine layer of dust covers everything in this chamber, as well an eerie
stillness.  The feel of antiquity hangs heavy upon this chamber, the stale
air almost stifling.

A Converted Library~
This large room, once a cave lair, has been converted by the Lsakia tribe
to store supplies.  Both the western and southern walls are consumed by
empty bookshelves of some dark wood.  Inset into the dust-covered black
marble of the floor is a sigil of some sort in white, partially covered by
the barrels and crates stored there.  Along the north wall is a small
counter of dark wood, reams of canvas cloth draped over it.  A small
fireplace is set in the northeastern corner of the room, across from the
shelves.  Thick canvas cloth is strung up over the hollows in the roof of
the cavern to protect it from the unforgiving sun of the wastes.  The
eastern wall is mostly unadorned, save for a few shelves midway up the wall,
and an opening leading outside.  Another opening leads into another room to

tartan~
A rough, heavily-woven strip of homespun cloth, perhaps bjorcha-wool, is
hanging between the alcohol-racks.  The central swath of the tartan is a
deep, royal blue, surrounded by a plaid pattern of bright red, forest green,
ochre, and hints of black.  Extra yarns, added later, it seems, compliment
and elaborate the original pattern, almost as if telling a story in some
primitive, tribal manner.  Overall, the bright, garish threads,
dichotomously discordant yet complimentary, blend well with each other, the
weave strong and symbolic.  A brighter slash of ochre, almost a yellow,
zigzags crazily down the length of the central blue stripe.  Seventeen heavy
bone pins, slightly curved, are pushed through the coarse weave. 
Bloodstained, they each bear a burnt-in \@X\@ on the wider end.  Seven thick
black skeins of wool twist through one end of the tartan.  
There is a small brass plaque set just below the tartan.

The chiseled stone walls are barren apart from the empty torch sconces
that line the perimeter.  The floor has been paneled with softwood pine, a

statue~
Carved from a marble of the most brilliant white, the statue stands about
six paces in height, and slightly less than four across.  The light of the
room hugs itself around the statues curves, and reflects off the smooth
porcelain surface, giving the stone a delicate lustre.  A solid rectangular
marble block acts as the foundation of this statue. 
   
Stone rose petals litter the base of the statue, carpeting the area with a
sea of delicate curves. Each of the individual pieces has been meticulously
shaped by hand, the finer lines of some of the petals apparently visible.
Shadows weave in and out along the edges, forming jagged lines on an
otherwise even surface. On and on the floral deathbed stretches, mainly
undisturbed save for the winged horse-like figure that stands above and a
small wolfs skull seated to the far right.
  
The Pegasus itself is perched upon its hind legs, with both forelegs raised
victoriously out in front. Framing its body are obsidian skeletal wings,
each fanning out discordantly in every direction. The body of the beast has
seen better days, with each individual rib clearly accountable for, and a
limp mane that hangs in a disheveled heap along its slender neck. The ears
are pressed against the side of its head, and the lips are folded back in a
garish display of teeth. Its eyeless head is turned to face the doorway, a
look of abject terror the welcoming sight for all who visit.
  
A small brass plaque hangs to upon the side of the base, with two simple
words etched upon its surface: \#The Hunted.\#

The Lair of the Basilisk~
The floor of this chamber is littered shattered stone and strewn with the
ground dust of countless rocks.  A closer inspection reveals the rubble to
be made of what appears to be broken pieces of statuary.  A carved face
here, a granite animal there.  They all seem to be of the highest quality,
despite being in ruins, the undamaged surfaces appearing almost lifelike.  A
large pile of rubble has been gathered toward the back of the cave by
whatever creature inhabits this place.
