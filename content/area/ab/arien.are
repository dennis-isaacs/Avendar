lowlands.  Assigned here by the Patrician alongside a small number of
soldiers to keep an eye on srryn activity in these parts, he makes careful
use of his time as he patrols this borderland, often found watching rather
than resting.  His body is well-built, a fitting look for a templar-soldier,
and he holds fast with his seemingly bulky armor, the grace of him evident
in his move.

Carved from pure grey marble and marked with mystical runes, this vault
is an enormous room, easily large enough to hold a stone giant, or even a
dragon.  Supported by enormous tons of stone, the Vault appears designed to
survive a very large amount of punishment.  The once-pristine marble is
scorched a pure ash-black, coated with a thick layer of grimy cinders, but
otherwise unharmed.  Each rune glows with renewed spiritlight.  The floor is
oddly smooth and unhurt, the glassy surface now polished to a mirror finish.
To the north, a charred archway leads out onto the open, ruined dome.

a shield made from a golden dragon scale~
A large golden scale, fitted to be a shield, lies here.~
Pulled from the corpse of the avatar of An\@akarta himself, the Flame of
Logor, this shield is legendary.  The Flame occupied the Tower of Aramril
when it was captured and desecrated during the Eyeblight War.  Forces of
Light and Order invaded the Tower with the Staff of Vysara, retaking it.  In
the battle, An\@akarta was cast down, and his hide adorns the dome of the
Champions once more.

gleaming golden scale shield large an~
This gleaming scale is a single piece of dragonhide, the surface
burnished and reflective as molten gold.  The texture of the front is
immensely hard and rippled slightly.  The back is as soft as suede, the
finely-tanned dragonhide like cushioning leather.  Fine wrought-silver
handles have been fitted into the back, a silver sunburst of the Light
hammered above them.

A pair of ghara-skin boots float here, etched silver wings affixed to the heels.~
Little concrete is known about these boots - there is a fairy tale of a
companion of Aeolis who journeyed beneath and over the western oceans in a
vain search for Ilodaiya.  While continuing his epic trek across the ocean
floor, the nameless adventurer - always referred to as \#The Whiteblade\# -
encountered an undersea enchantress.  She had recovered the boots, which
were useless underwater, from a shipwreck.  As she did not knowing their
true value, he was able to barter them away for, quite literally, a song.  

He was later said to have died in a wild windstorm.  Flying, the air carried
him to a violent death, where the rest of his band (safely earthbound)
survived.  The fairy tale is often told as a warning against hubris and
against greed.

A old chalice of beaten silver rests here, inset with sapphires.~
This is undoubtedly the Chalice of saint Aramril, paladin of bygone days
and founder of the Champions of Avendar.  Gifted to him by his beloved
companion, the archmage Salyra, this chalice was enchanted by her to remain
ever-full.  Legends tell of it having purifying properties, even to the
point of healing the mortally wounded.  

Upon Aramril\@s death, the Chalice passed from general to general, each
leader of the Order of Aramril inheriting it from the previous.  After it
was nearly lost in a pitched battle with the Coven of the Shunned, however,
Avistis ordered it buried beneath the foundations of the Tower.  There it
lay, safe and secure for centuries, until the ruined Tower was pulled down
in the Eyeblight War after its reclaiming from the hands of the shuddeni
Scourge.

This chalice is quite old, wrought from the purest silver.  The metal\@s

craftsmanship which forged it.  A simple octagonal base narrows to a
straight, octagonal stem.  Above the stem the cup swells out into a broad,
cylindrical bowl with a rounded bottom.  Four small, oval sapphires have
been carefully set into the metal at regular intervals along the sides.  

The chalice has an indefinable aura of sanctity and purity, always full of
clear, cool water which seems almost to shimmer with dancing light.

A fearsome kankoran has been carved out of pure white marble with

battle readiness.  In his hands is a short, barb-tipped stabbing spear, and
on his head a dragon-skull helm.  His muzzle protrudes past the helm, the
stony lips drawn back in a feral snarl.  His eyes are set with a pair of
semiprecious stones, the dark gems seeming to glitter with anger.

raised in a welcoming gesture.  Her wings are folded tightly behind her, and
a rose-entwined sword is carved on her upper arm - the mark of Aeolis.  Her
expression is kind but stern.  Her other hand holds a staff at her side, the
weapon itself made from weathered bronze.
  
Her neck is also arched, lending her chin slightly up, her gaze skyward.
Her face is radiant and striking, crafted with extraordinary care to
maintain the tender smile glancing her lips.  Her hair drifts softly on a
static wind, flowing over the girl\@s pointed ears, showing painstaking
artisanship.  A rose rests over her left ear, strands of hair softly
cascading to either side of it.

tall aramril yellow marble human male man~
This statue is the carved image of Aramril, the famed human warrior who
led the band of humans and aelin who roused Jolinn, Father of the Seas, in
the defining moment of the War of Fire.  He is clad in heavy, crested
platemail, and he bears in both hands his legendary hammer, topped with two
impressive sapphires.  His head is turned low, his brow furrowed with
determination, and his broad shoulders seem to carry upon them the weight of
unimaginable struggle.  Semi-precious stones have been set into his eyes,
and his short hair is frozen mid-drift on a sculptor\@s breeze.  One of his
crested boots stands upon the enormous claw of some great beast, its surface
coated in gold.  

A small plaque of pure gold adorns the statue\@s feet.

carved healer\@s robes, and she leans on her legendary staff, the Ahidaya. 
Her hair has been carved tied up in a loose bun, an unprepossessing kerchief
holding it out of her eyes.  Her sleeves are rolled up, and a bandage
protrudes from her pocket.  A gentle, compassionate smile graces her
lovingly-carved face, her eyes cast earthward in an expression both demure

crown crystal crystals crystalline pure purest quartz obj_8886~
This crown is made of utterly transparent quartz, too large to have
been made from any single crystal but with no visible seams. It is
utterly without ornament, even the tines of the crown jutting upwards
in the natural shape of the crystal, six-sided prisms topped with
six-sided pyramids. Only a miniscule inspection of them reveals the
geometry to be too precise; crafted with artifice rather than by
nature. Where light shines through the crown, it suffuses with a smoky
colour; there is a faint hint of blue to the shade. Despite the
glassy look to the crown, the construction has a thorough feel of
permanence; it feels as though it is meant to endure, above all else.

a leaf-shaped longsword inlaid with gold~
A long sword lies here, its leaf-shaped blade inlaid with gold.~
One of the leaf-blades of the seraph Cohort, the dual hilt and
distinctive shape easily set this sword apart from mortal weapons.  The
relic at the bottom is ch\@lonin, and its curvature and manner of destruction
suggest that it came from a delicate, small vase or amphora.  Such amphora
are often carried into battle by the warriors of heaven, and used to anoint
the dead and dying.

sword longsword leaf shaped leaf-shaped blade inlaid gold~
This sword is forged from gleaming steel - bright and without flaw, its
workmanship is breathtaking.  The long blade slowly swells as it reaches
from hilt to tip, bending gracefully out into a symmetrical, leaf-shaped
curvature.  A blood runnel runs the length of the blade, the shallow channel
chased with minute spirit runes.  Whorls of gold inlay have been lovingly
forged into the sword, creating a wandering, abstract pattern along the
blade.  A wide dual-hilt is equipped with a finger-loop, helping the wearer
to maintain a tight grip on the white leather which wraps the handle. 
Secured in the steel pommel is a small crystal, roughly one inch in
diameter.  The faceted crystal gleams, for a tiny, shattered fragment of
translucent, glowing ch\@lonin has been secured within.  The relic is little
more than a splinter, but has been affixed with great care.

This simple iron brazier is a dish of metal supported by three squat

The Arien Plains~
The broad stone strip known as the Arien Road turns to the south at this
point, leading to the waters of the Dantaron River, and beyond to Var
Bandor. The Arien Plains spread to the north and west, their unbroken
monotony extending as far as eye can see.

The Arien Road~
The broad strip of stones known to travelers as the Arien Road stretches
into the distance to the west.  The flat monotony of the Plains of Arien are
the only view to the north and south.  Far to the east, the gray walls of
the city Earendam rise, barely visible in the distance.

The Brintor Road~
The wide dirt way known as the Brintor Road leads north through the Arien
Plains, gashing a brown line through the monotony of the prairies.  Deep ruts
carved into the road indicate the passing of carts and caravans seeking
trade with the people of the Brintor Mountains to the north.  South, the
Arien Road leads between Earendam and Var Bandor.

Inside the Caravan~
The inside of the caravan smells heavily of salted meats and pickled
fish, which have been packed away inside of various crates.  Indeed, the
rickety wooden surface of the caravan is covered with boxes, barrels, and
crates, each one stuffed with assorted sundry goods.  A sturdy canvas
shelters the caravan from the blazing Arien sun, the thick cloth drawn
tightly over a wooden ribcage.  The floor beneath bounces and shakes, as
spoked wheels roll over the uneven plains.

Inside a Large Tent~
Erected amidst the grasses of the Arien Plains, this large tent is quite
spacious.  Sturdy wooden poles support the canvas walls of the tent. 
Several lanterns hang from the poles to provide light, as the thick canvas
of the walls blocks light from outside.  A number of crates and worn
furnishings are spread about the dirt floor of the tent, and the faint scent
of sweat lingers in the air.  To the south lies the exit from the tent,
while to the north a heavy curtain divides the tent in half.

The Alliance Pavilion~
The white canvas of the pavilion is suspended from a high, broad wooden
frame, the center of which is a thick post of pine.  The floor is covered in
stacks of boxes, barrels, chests, and various other containers, but a wide
space is cleared near the center post.  A table stands next to the post,
covered in maps and miscellaneous parchments listing troop numbers and
movements.

Several lanterns hang from the poles to provide light, as the thick canvas
of the walls blocks light from outside.  A few small cots are arranged in
this end of the tent, and piles of unwashed clothes are scattered about the
dirt floor.  A heavy curtain hangs across the tent to the south, dividing
the tent in two.

The Partially-Built Tower of Aramril~
An open courtyard, floored in smooth, dusty white gypsum, stretches
thirty feet between the yellow sandstone walls.  The large, curved stone
blocks are built nearly twenty feet overhead, though open sky still shows
above.  An empty socket lies in the center of the courtyard, and a curving
line of metal brackets climbs the northern wall.  

To the south, the Arien Plains open past the entry arch.
