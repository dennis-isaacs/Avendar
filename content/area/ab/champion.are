Averin~
A ch\@taren scholar tends the library of the Champions.
~
A warm, golden glow spills off of this ch\@taren\@s translucent skin. 
Averin\@s shining blue eyes are surrounded by crow\@s feet, betraying a
laughter-filled life.  Long, silver hair falls low about his shoulders,
blending into his lengthy white robes.  A single adornment is present on his
spotless attire: a teardrop embroidered in gold thread.  A member of the
Order of Aenea, he first served at the Spirit Palace before its fall, and
then afterward in Jh\@ten.  He now spends his days maintaining the Champion
library.

A tall, fair-skinned aelin with pearlescent wings stands before the northern portal.
~
Clad in the livery of the Champions of Avendar, Aliphor is a tall,
fair-skinned aelin.  His mop of black hair hangs low over his curved ears,
his slate-grey eyes alert for trouble.  Broad, pearly wings unfurl from his
back, hovering ready behind his shoulders.  Although relatively young among
the Order, his talents as a templar have earned him his current assignment
as watchman for the building to the north.

Dressed in the garb of the Champions of the Light, this knight of Aramril

ealiryon healer~
Ealiryon~
Ealiryon administers the sickbay with a sharp, watchful eye.
~
An ethron of short stature, Ealiryon Ysandril putters about nearby.  His
leaf-green skin is mostly concealed by a thick blue robe, typical of the
Tower of Salyra.  Short, salt-and-pepper hair frames his balding crown, his
round face wizened with time and toil.  Concern is often present in his
chestnut eyes, his brow marked with deep creases.  Although his waistline
has expanded with age, his thick, green arms still bear considerable tone. 
A retired scholar of some renown among his people, he now tends the Champion
wounded and the nearby chapel of Jolinn.

Antlarus armorer~
Antlarus~
Antlarus works diligently at the forge.
~
Heavily muscled and flecked with black dust, Antlarus works the forge. 
Stocky and average in height, his facial features and light skin reflect his
Earendamian heritage.  Despite his greying hair, the march of time has yet
to hamper his duties in the armory.  Once a traveler himself, he practiced
the magics of earth with the Glallian School.  His spellcraft, however, was
outstripped by his talents in metalworking.  Since joining the Champions, he
has served tirelessly as both armorer and weaponsmith.

Akraelyn Champion emeritus trainer train ctrainer gladiator~
Akraelyn~
Akraelyn, Son of Jolinn, stands ready to train his fellow Champions.
~
A man of middling height, Akraelyn stands resolutely before you.  Broad
across the shoulders, with well defined muscles, his thick arms are crossed
with faded scars.  His dark, weather-worn skin is covered loosely by a
coarse, short-sleeved tunic.  Thick bands of iron are wrapped about his
forearms, each one engraved with the sign of the Sapphire Spear.  Quiet in
appearance, he carries himself like a hunted beast, his wary eyes ever
searching over the surrounding area.  

Closely cut locks of unkempt, greying hair frame his hardened face.  The
shadow cast by the tired strands falls over a noble brow, which looms
majestically over his clear green eyes.  Thick, grizzly stubble lines his
resolute jaw, giving him a rough and disheveled appearance.  Once-full
cheeks have grown thin, enunciating the authoritative aspect of his chin.  

Now retired from his legendary career, Akraelyn is still renowned for his
legendary exploits.  A man who began life in the slave pits of Ashta Harrud,
he escaped to walk the lands of Avendar as a Champion and follower of
Jolinn.  In time, he came to be leader of his Order, and guided the Tower of
Aramril through the turbulent years marking the rise of the Coven of the
Shunned.  From facing the dread Tzet-Sabanthe to his travails in the realm
of dreams, he proved his mettle time and again as battle leader.  Now, he
has returned from wandering Avendar as leader emeritus, and trains young
Champions, putting them through their paces here in the tower garden.

a pair of twice-blessed gloves~
A pair of blessed chainmail gloves lies here.~
These gloves are among the most well-known artifacts of the light, and
hallowed relics of the Champions of Avendar.  It is said that during the War
of Night, they were first blessed by Jolinn Himself, and worn into battle by
Lystaran as he led the Army of the Golden Hand.  They say that the
protection it granted preserved the hero during many brushes with death.  

With the close of the War, the gloves were given as a gift to Calaera, the
great heroine of the ch\@taren.  The gloves represented something of a pact
between the embattled Earendamian humans and the outsiders that turned the
tide against the shuddeni and demonic forces.  It is said that She wore them
as She and Her Warband hunted down the butchers of Ad\@masteisa, and Rystaia
Lightbringer blessed them with supernatural speed.  

In the time since, the gloves have been worn into battle by the Champions of
Avendar, and guarded by their famous leader, Akraelyn.

ch\@lonin sword blade gold golden~
a ch\@lonin sword~
A translucent gold sword lies here.~
The ch\@lonin sword is a legendary weapon of the Champions of Avendar and
among the world\@s most famous weapons.  It was recovered by Lord General
Avistis, who delved into the Dream Realms and returned alive.  The sword
itself possessed only a fragment of its true power; at that point, it was
little more than a unique-looking weapon.  Some believe that its power was
expended during the imprisonment of Serachel at the end of the War of Night,
and lingered there with Him.  

With Avistis\@ death to the Coven of the Shunned, the sword fell into the
hands of his wife, Lady Yesa Aea\@ria.  It was she who guarded the sword for
much of her lifetime, and who established its tradition of being a Champion
artifact.  With the defeat and sealing of Gyel-Xan, leader of the cult of
Sothmogga, the Titan king, Anirim, unlocked much of the sword\@s latent
power.  The vengeful wrath of the ancient ch\@taren dwells within it, causing
the blade to inspire zeal, shield from darkness, and erupt with piercing
white light.  

The blade itself vanished for many centuries without a trace.  Some believe
that this, too, was a Coven plot initiated by its High Priestess, Iluya
Judessa.  There are few records to corroborate her role, or lack thereof, in
the transition of the blade.  It would remain absent until the close of the
Eyeblight War, when it was recovered during the assault on the occupied
Spirit Palace by Iridrorn, the future field-martial of Aramril.  Since that
time, its fearsome reputation has again struck fear into evil hearts.

                       -----------------------------
Hello, adventurer.  You\@ve been honored with the opportunity to serve the 
light as a Champion of the Light.  As a Champion, you will be based in the 
Tower of Aramril.  In the tower you\@ll find fellowship with brothers and 
sisters of the same mindset.  The tower stands as a bastion against the 
darkness that threatens the world.
  
Your purpose in the tower is to carry out Aramril\@s tenets.  You\@re to see
that justice is served, mercy is granted, and courage never falters.  As 
you are a Champion, so are you marked out;  there will be those that hunt 
you simply because you are who you are.  Still, so long as you honor your 
oath, and enforce the tenets, Aramril will always offer you refuge.
  
The order of Aramril is a militant one; as all military orders, it has 
its structure and regulations.  I have compiled this manual in an attempt
to convey this information to you.  Read it and understand its content, 
for along with the the three tenets and the three commandments, this 
information forms the basis for the Champions of the Light.
~
E
codex3~
{WCHAPTER 2 - Structure of the Champions{n
                --------------------------------------
The Champions are divided into several ranks.  These ranks are instituted 
in order that a chain of command be established.  The chain of command 
will be detailed in the next chapter.  Each position has its own 
responsibilities.  In this chapter, I will attempt to detail them.  It 
should be noted that guild standing has little to do with what position 
one attains.  Rank is attained only through merit.  
    
The highest mortal power in Aramril is that of the Lord General. The 
Lord General is chosen by a deity of the light; generally this would be 
Jolinn.  The General\@s word is law.
    
 When it comes to the conflicts that arise in the tower, the General is 
the final arbiter.  He or she oversees the overall direction in which the 
house will go.  The General is responsible for inducting new members, as well
 as giving them positions within the order.  The General is also responsible 
for maintaining relations with other houses.
  
The Chancellor is the General\@s most trusted advisor.  He or she is 
generally well respected and quite a tactician.  It\@s his or her job to aid 
the General in making the various decisions that affect the internal state 
of the tower.  Disputes amongst ranking officers are to be forwarded to the 
Chancellor, as well as the General.  It should be noted that the 
Chancellor is the highest power appointed by a mortal, in the tower.
~
E
codex4~
The title of Paladin is bestowed upon those directly under the command of 
the Chancellor.  They act as tacticians, formulating plans of battle, and 
seeing that they are acted out properly.  Paladins are generally very 
knowledgable adventurers.  A Paladin must be a good leader, as he or she 
will be called on to lead soldiers into battle.
  
A Knight is a Champion who has proven his or her mettle.  He or she has 
either been a novice for a long time, or has distinguished himself in some 
way.  The Knight is considered the most common type of soldier in the 
order they make up the backbone of Aramril\@s army.  Knights are capable 
leaders; in the event that a Paladin is not present to act thusly, they 
will do so.  As a Knight, one is expected to demonstrate the tenets of Aramril 
superbly.
  
The lowest rank in the tower is that of Novice.  The Novice is generally a 
new Champion.  Novices are directly under the command of the more 
experienced Knights; he or she has generally demonstrated his knowledge of 
the tenets, but has not borne the burden of time, or distinguished his or 
her self in some way.  Novices hearken: though you are the least 
experienced of the order, you are in no way insignifigant.  As a Champion 
of Avendar, you have found fellowship.

{WCHAPTER 3 - Behavior Suggestions for Each Rank{n
             ----------------------------------------------
  
Behaviour of the Ranks:
  
{YNovice{n: 
  
Novices are expected to spend much of their time in meditation about the 
tenets of Aramril, and in service to their brethren, following the orders 
of their commanding Knight and other authorities within the Tower, within
reason.  To be a novice is to reflect upon what it is to be a Champion of 
the Light, and what the future holds.
  
{YKnight{n:
  
To be a Knight of the Champions is to know what one should be doing and 
how one will best serve in the current situation.  Instead of meditation, 
a Knight should always be out of the Tower, and in amongst the general
populace, doing the good works of the Champions.  However, the Tower,
as always, serves as a refuge for when the Knight requires rest or 
protection.
  
{YPaladin{n: 
  
A Paladin of the Champions is always working to coordinate and direct the 
works of the Knights and Novices below him.  He may spend more time in the 
tower, working on plans and giving reports to the Chancellor and the High
General, but he will also perform all the duties of a Knight as he is able 
to.  Paladins are those who walk on the path of Righteousness, with little 
or no error.
  
{YChancellor{n: 
The Chancellor, being the highest ranked Champion appointed by a mortal, 
is held to the highest standard.  His assistance is always given to the 
High General, and his works to monitor and deal with matters takes high 
priority.  He aids the High General as his closest and most trusted 
advisor, and is often known for his great wisdom and clarity of vision.
  
{YHigh General{n: 
The Champion of the Champions, the person chosen for this responsibility 
must not walk the path of righteousness, but walk a path so narrow it 
would thread a needle.  He is, naturally, the role model of
the Champions.
~
E
codex6~
{WCHAPTER 4 - Common Military Courtesy{n
                   ------------------------------------
  
Custom and courtesty have both a place and a purpose in the order of Aramril. 
There are a few methods of address and ceremony that you will need to learn. 
You will be expected to adhere to these guidelines, as through them, you will 
convey respect to your fellow Champions.  Read this chapter, and learn well 
its contents.  If you do so, you will find your time in Aramril much more 
efficient.
  
Firstly, we will consider the salute.  The salute is the most basic kind 
of knightly courtesy.  It conveys the respect for the person that you are 
saluting.  A salute is initiated by the lower ranking officer; if the 
officers are of the same rank, either may initiate.  A salute should 
always be returned.  It is very disrespectful for an officer to receive a 
salute, and not give one in return.  To properly administer a salute, an
officer stands rigid. The officer then places the right hand to the left 
forearm, and the left hand to the right forearm.
  
Secondly, there is the matter of address.  You will address a superior 
officer by their rank.  Knight so-and-so, Paladin so-and-so, etc.  
Officers of the same rank are to address each other as Brother so-and-so or 
Sister so-and-so, in front of Champions of the lower ranks.  Privately, 
they may address each other by name.  Higher ranked officers may address 
those of lower rank by name, though the title brother or sister is 
always considered more respectful.  Also, you may answer officers of a 
superior rank with the respectful titles \#Sir\# and \#Ma\@am\#.  
  
As was previously stated, these guidelines are just that:  guidelines.  In 
times of battle, or in situations that might be perilous, some or all of 
these formalities may be dispensed with.  It is expected that a Champion 
of Aramril will have the good sense to know when this be the case.  Through 
these measures, it is hoped that we might come to love and respect one 
another to an even higher degree.
~
E
codex7~
{WChapter 5 - The Chain of Command{n
                     --------------------------------
  
In order to be the efficient force that it is is, the Champions of Aramril 
must maintain a strict chain of command. Without this, there might be 
ambiguity as to what is to be done.  The resulting chaos might lead to 
defeat in battle.  To prevent this from happening, I will attempt to 
completely document how all militant actions should be carried out.  
  
An officer always carries out the commands of a superior officer.  A command 
may be questioned, but not publicly.  This should be done privately with the 
officer in question.  Regardless, commands are to be immediately carried 
out.  Officers are expected to consult their lesser ranked comrades, in hopes 
that an efficient plan of battle be formulated.  
  
Problems with a ranking officer should be forwarded to the General and 
the Chancellor.  This includes problems with commands that have been 
given. They may attempt to disregard the dispute, speak with the 
officer informally, or call a council of Champions.  The council of 
Champions is the most dire consequence of the three.  The decision to 
call council is the at the sole discretion of the General.  
  
A council of Champions is a formal affair; it is only used in the most 
dire of situations.  It is open to all Champions; all who are able to 
attend will be required to do so.  Firstly, the accused will testify
on his own behalf.  After that, he will be allowed to call witnesses
in his defense.  If the accusor is present, he will then be allowed to 
speak; if not, then the Lord General will present the case against the 
accused.
~
E
codex8~
After both sides are heard, a formal vote will be taken as to the guilt or 
innocence of the accused party.  The Lord General does not receive a vote, 
but he or she may overrule any decision.  If the procedure is not 
completed as explained, the Council is considered a mistrial, and no 
action will be taken against the accused Champion.
  
By following the chain of command stringently, a semblance of order will 
be achieved.  Battles will be fought more smoothly; ambiguity amongst the 
ranks will be minimized.  It is expected that every Champion adhere to the 
rules regarding the chain of command.  To circumvent the chain of command 
is immediate grounds for disciplinary action.
~
E

{WCHAPTER 6 - Final{n
                          -----------------
    
In coming to the tower, you have made a great step.  I am confident that 
each of you will find your place in the tower, and that you will use it to 
enforce our tenets.  Through the regimentalization of Aramril\@s forces, 
we will better be able to purify the world of dark influence.  It is the 
belief of this author that if you memorize this manual, adhere to its edicts, 
and do your best to enforce the tenets of Aramril, you will succeed as a 
Champion.  I bid you all well, and hope that you find happiness as a soldier 
of the light.

This room is much longer than it is wide, stretching a long ways both
north and south.  The room is filled with rows and rows of cots and bunks,
but otherwise is very sparsely furnished.  A small hearth on the south wall
provides warmth, and the only exit lies north.  The walls are built from
warm yellow stone, the chamber comfortable and cozy.  Thick woolen rugs,
dyed a pale blue, cover the floor, and small shelves sit at the foot of each
bed, filled with the inconsequential accoutrements of everyday life.  A

Foyer of the Tower of Aramril~
Built from large, solid blocks of buttery yellow sandstone, this D-shaped
room acts as a foyer to the Tower of Aramril itself, home of the Champions
of the Light.  Bright wall hangings of light silk flank the white stone
archway leading north, and two more adorn the curved southern walls.  A tall
room, no ceiling in sight, opens past the doorless archway.  The ceiling is
constructed from bands of lighter and darker stone, creating concentric
patterns.  The floor is smooth, laid in gleaming marble of a pale, dusty
rose.  To the south, a reinforced doorway leads out into the grounds.

A lengthy drape of sea-blue silk, the skeleton of the ancient Tower of
Aramril is embroidered in silver and gold thread.  Surrounding it are a
number of human figures, some hefting blocks and others posed as if to lay
bricks.  Toward the top of the structure, colorful renditions of the Titans
heft the great scales of An\@Akarta onto the frame of the Dome.  In the
background, both above and around the construction effort, a majestic
depiction of the Father of the Seas looks on, one great hand appearing
pressed to the Tower\@s side.

Crafted of midnight-black silk and draped with dark blues, this striking
tapestry is awash with color.  The embroidered yellow of the Tower is broken
up by flares of crimson lined in silver, darkened patches marring its
pristine surface.  Demonic and shuddeni figures, styled to look even more
sinister and diabolic than usual, raise their arms and claws gleefully in
victory.  Shining gold thread is stitched in to represent the great scales
of the Dome, littered about the barren ground below.  Behind the Tower\@s
broken frame is a magnificently woven Rhos, surrounded by thick, purple
clouds.  
~
E
northwest~
Dyed in pale grey, this silk hanging vividly portrays the reconstruction
of the Tower during the War of the Eyeblight.  Charred shuddeni bodies and
wretched demonic corpses are being carried from the yellow walls by a
variety of indistinct figures.  Around the grounds, other, similar figures
erect a protective wall, outlined in black threading to accent the dull silk
beneath it.  As before, the golden hide of the Flame of Logor is being
raised to the Tower\@s apex, all of which stitched in vibrant whites, golds,
and beige.  The mighty, spectral hands of Jolinn glitter as they encircle
the scene.

This long, silken hanging is a pure, triumphant white.  On it, a
magnificent golden wyrm writhes in its death throes, its hide pierced by a

been outlined more thickly to indicate his primacy.  Wearing the familiarly
crested armor of the Order, the character can be none other than Saint
Aramril the Martyr.  Posed in action, his hammer is frozen in motion as it
crushes one of the beast\@s great razor-claws.

walled in large blocks of rich yellow stone which soar far overhead, past a
second-floor circular walkway, terminating high above in a vaulted,
patterned ceiling.  Equally tall stained glass windows, no more than a foot
wide, run the entire height of the wall, filling the room with colored light
by day.  By night, a large, sunburst silver lamp hanging from the balcony is
lit.  A large fountain of carved marble sits in the center of the room, an
abundance of ferns growing in planters around its base.  A floor of polished
black marble shines with a mirror finish.  Tall arches lead out of the

The large Atrium narrows through a plain archway into this hall.  A small
storeroom lies to the north, smelling of burlap and salted meat.  To the
south, a long, low dining hall stretches, the smells of warmer food drifting
past.  The hall itself is built from large, yellow sandstone blocks.  The

rugs.  On the western wall, a tapestry of a tall caladaran hangs.

This large chamber is filled with low wooden dining tables, arranged
casually throughout the room.  An enormous hearth is inset in the southern
wall, serving as a place for after-meal socializing.  Above it, a wall
hanging bearing the standard of the Champions hangs proudly for all to see. 
A pair of tall, clear windows are set into the western wall, for the
two-fold purpose of natural lighting and to showcase the natural beauty of
the Tower grounds.  A grand bas-relief has been worked onto the eastern
wall, depicting a historic scene.  The exit lies to the north, where the

Commandments of the Champions
 
As given by Jolinn, Lord of the Sapphire Spear
 
As the tenets of our Order are three, so too are the Commandments divided.
 
I. Courage
 
1. Champions are expected to exemplify moral courage, always striving to 
behave in a manner keeping with their ideals.
2. Champions are required to challenge evil should it intrude on the Tower of 
Aramril. While not expected to perish foolishly, Champions are expected
to harry enemies so long as they walk the grounds of the tower.
 
II. Justice
 
1. Do not quarrel with a man, unless his heart be black, or he has done wrong
in your sight.
2. A Champion must try to correct injustice wherever he sees it. Whenever a
Champion witnesses an unjust act, it is his duty to attempt to correct the 
injustice.
 
III. Mercy
 
1. Always succor those free from the taint of evil when they are in need.
2. Always allow for repentance in one\@s foes -- but do not be blind to those 
who do evil.

awning overhead shades occupants from the worst of the midday heat.  From
here, there is an uninhibited view of the Arien Plains, from Earendam\@s
stately walls to Var Bandor\@s squat boundaries.  The Dantaron river flows to
the south, a silver ribbon along the horizon.  Wind whips past, quick and
steady, with nothing nearby to hamper its course.

weather vane image griffin apex~
This tall golden weather vane keeps pace with the changing direction of
the fickle winds.  Crafted from steel and coated with gold, its shape is
that of a noble griffin.  Notably, the image bears more similarity to those
griffins who dwell within the Titan Castle than those that live, wild, near
the Uthlin Ocean.

awning canvas thick green~
Sturdy and thick, this canvas awning is well-weathered this high above
the Tower.  Although originally a dark green, the overexposure to the
beating sun, rain, and snow has faded it significantly.  However, despite
its occasional fraying edge, it still functions effectively.  It does not,
however, do much to prevent the overpowering shine of the Dome itself during
the daytime.

dome sun golden scales~
The hide of which the Dome consists is immense; each scale is well over
two feet in length and ripples and shines like molten gold.  With the
structural ribbing inside, the top of the Tower shines like an enormous
beacon.  While the light it radiates at night can be seen by both of the
nearby cities, its intense glare can be quite oppressive during the daylight
hours.

A Flagstone Pathway~
A small flagstone pathway leads from the gatehouse set in the thick outer
wall to the south, running northwards.  It arrives at the white marble
threshold of the yellow sandstone Tower of Aramril which stretches high into
the air.  Perfectly round, the tower is surrounded by a shorter, though
still quite tall, outer curtain wall of paler yellow stone.  In the space
between lavish gardens have been planted, a profusion of flowering plants
growing with almost unnatural fertility.  A meandering path of stepping
stones makes its way through the grounds to the east and west.

A Yellow Sandstone Gatehouse~
This is the gatehouse of the Tower of Aramril.  It passes several paces
through the width of the massive outer curtain wall.  The enormous blocks of
yellow sandstone, a warm and rich butter color, are fitted together without
any sign of mortar.  The walls curve upwards in a smooth barrel vault.  From
the center of the roof hangs a wrought silver lamp.  The spiked bottom of a
heavy portcullis of silver-ornamented steel is visible, kept open except in
the most dire of emergencies.  To the south, the Arien Plains stretch, vast,
grey, and dusty.  A flagstone path leads north out of the gatehouse, through
lush grounds, to the Tower actual.

stalks.  Bright yellow forsythia bushes shift in the slightest breeze, and
modest periwinkle fills the available space.  A meandering path of stepping
stones wanders through the gardens, breaking off from a flagstone path to
the west and arriving in more serene lawns to the east.  The Tower of
Aramril soars into the sky to the north, its outer curtain wall standing to

The yellow sandstone Tower of Aramril stretches high into the air here,

fire demon An\@akarta, gleams softly in the light.  Perfectly round, the
tower is surrounded by a shorter, though still quite tall, outer curtain
wall of paler yellow stone.  In the space between a fertile lawn grows,
bordered on either side by simple, fragrant white roses.  A meandering path
of stepping stones makes its way through the grounds to the north and west,

To the south, the Tower itself stands high in the air, its golden-scaled
dome gleaming grandly.  A flagstone path approaches the Tower in that
direction.  

Five trees of varying height grow around the edges of the green-grassed
yard, shading and protecting it: to the north, an enormous sycamore.  To the
northwest, a small rowan and a holly grow together, and a glossy magnolia to
the northeast.  To the west a slender birch leans out into the yard, and to
the east, a humble dogwood stands.

A barrel-vaulted ceiling dominates this chamber, four skylights set into
it.  Its construction could be described as utilitarian at best, the walls
built of the same dull, golden stone as the Tower to the south.  A wide,
weathered map of Avendar has been hung on the northern wall, framed in
polished cherry.  A matching cherry desk, bookshelf, and roster take up much
of the eastern side of the room, while two simple chairs face the desk\@s
front.  A large, silken tapestry hangs across the western wall, silver
tassels hanging from its edges.  Although the stone floor is largely

tapestry large silken silver tassels western~
Edged with silver tassels, this large hanging tapestry depicts the surge
of the seraphim into the occupied Spirit Palace.  A tribute to the close of
the Eyeblight War, various figures are threaded in bold colors: the first is
a slender man masked in white, bearing glittering swords.  Beside him is an
aelin woman, radiating light marked by outstretched rays of white and gold. 
On the left side, a large alatharya is present, his thick hands balled up in
mighty fists.  Alone on the right is a golden-skinned girl clad in black,
her hands wrapped in white fire.  By far the principal character in this
scene stands at its center, a winged figure encrusted with shards of glass,
bow and sword both at the ready.  His golden eyes have no pupils, and his
stocky depiction typifies legendary prowess.  Among the more distinct
characters in the dark scene are a myriad of winged seraphim arrayed for
war.  The broken bodies of shuddeni, chaja, and demons are threaded
throughout the image, many charred walls splotched with patches of vivid
crimson.

map weathered wide avendar northern~
This map of Avendar looks well-worn, the framing effort an attempt to

lines and regional names, suggest that this was made during or before the
War of Fire.  On the western side of the map, the kingdom of Caal consumes
much of the Qilarn region, while the kingdom of Gogoth to the south is
depicted as open grasslands and fields.  The Republic of Earendam sprawls
out across the Earendam river valley, its border extending deep past
Lithling Valley\@s edge and north toward the keep of Nordath.  Beneath
Lithling Valley, a large expanse of dark marshland has been circled, with
various lines vectoring attack paths.  The far north shows a crude drawing
of a bull amidst the Brintors, which was obviously added later by a separate
hand.  The line to the south marks the trading post, Var Bandor, and the
long path downward into the nigh-impassable Crimson Sands.  
~
E
rug woolen center~
This thick woolen rug appears to be woven of bjorcha wool and dates back
to the era of Lord General Avistis.  Its rough texture and craftsmanship
suggest it was a wedding gift from Braka\@s pack, although its once sea-blue
hue has dimmed into grey with age.  The white device on its surface,
however, has remained clear and distinct throughout its long lifetime: the
sign of the Sapphire Spear crossing a shield.  
~
E
skylights four skylight~
Four skylights are inset into the vaulted ceiling of the chamber, each
one clear and clean.  During the daylight hours, the chamber is filled with
sunlight, giving it a far more open feel than its dull stones and close
walls would otherwise suggest.  At night, lamps in the room\@s corners
provide dim, subtle lighting in addition to the moonlight from above.  
~
E
ceiling barrel-vaulted barrel vaulted high~
Above you, the room\@s ceiling vaults upward, coming to apex at an iron
hemisphere inscribed with a starburst.  From that point outward, four
wrought-iron supports stretch downward, securing themselves in the dull wall
stones.  Four skylights, one in each quadrent, lessen further the enclosure
of the chamber.
