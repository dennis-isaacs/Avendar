The sprite sprite is little and delicate, except for his nose which is
somewhat large and pointy looking.  His hair is mussed and falling in his
face, barely allowing two mischievous blue eyes to peer out from
underneath.  Above all, though, he is filled with energy, bouncing and
laughing as he plays.

Santa\@s whore~
A sexy girl clothed in a short red and white lace teddy is here.
~
A ripe and shapely girl stands here, about 19 or 20 years old.  She wears
nothing but a revealing red and white teddy which barely keeps her decent,
and her long black hair falls over her giving teasing glimpses of flesh. 
Her full red lips in a sexy pout, she jingles quietly when she moves from
the small silver bells dangling from her red garters.

This small seraph is carved from soapstone.  Idealized and simple, it

This demon is little more than a large skeleton.  Made in mockery of the
great seraphim, it has four wings, two sprouting from its back and two from
its hips.  Wisps of rags cling to the skeleton, giving it the odd,

lolling without direction.

This exquisite sword is inlaid with silver, its grip bound with fine
leather.  The style of its make is distinctly otherwordly, given to exotic
ornamentation.  The blade itself seems hardly corporeal; rather, it seems to
have been somehow crafted from living flame.  Heat radiates from the weapon,
bathing all around it in fiery light.

This device is made from iron and thick glass.  It seems to center around
a large, hammered sphere of metal, roughly seven feet in diameter.  An
assortment of tarnished copper piping leads from the bottom and sides,
distributing the contents about the machine.  A crude bellows of cracked
leather slowly turns and wheezes on one side.  Several gears rotate with a
grating, ratcheting noise.  The square base on which the machine rests has
notches along the side.  A swinging lever seems designed to push heavy glass
bottles from a dispenser on the left, moving them below a spigot which
protrudes from the bottom of the sphere.  The entire thing shakes and whirs,
and steam hisses from joints periodically.  A dark fluid drips from the
spigot.  A large, square funnel on the top feeds into the sphere, its sides
darkened with old blood.  
  
The entire contraption looks rather fragile, despite being made from iron.

helm forged iron crest crested~
This forged iron helm has been made hastily and by hand, but seems to be
decent work regardless.  A basic curved helm, it covers the entire head. 
Eye-slots allow sight, and smaller holes increase the ability to breathe.  A
reinforcing, flanged crest runs from ear to ear around the back of the helm.

In the Clouds~
Wisps of mist occasionally brush past your face as you move onward.  The
clouds beneath your feet move in an ever changing pattern, creating new
pictures in their depths for your imagination to find.  The brightness makes
it a bit difficult to keep oriented, distracting and confusing with their
plays of shadow and light, but you can see the clouds continue in all

Mist settles into your clothing, and leaves a fine layer of moisture over

below.  The clouds flow along to the north, south and east.  West a large

A Wide Ledge~
The ledge is thick, reddish rock, extending from the sides of the

continual flight among the clouds, but mist creeps over the edge of the
cliff, making the exact boundries of where the land drops off again
difficult to tell.  Many feet and hooves have worn the stone into
smoothness, the only evidence of the passage of time in this almost heavenly
place.  To the north and south the ledge continues, and further east the
clouds and endless sky stretch out, basking in light.  West, a crevice

Breathless~
My eagle eyes came stumbling down over this pristine view,
Oh, my second rate poetry just is not enough to describe you.
I\@m scrambling around on the floor,
Looking for some fresh metaphor...
All the words to describe this just do not exist.
I feel better than ever before...
I\@m breathless and speechless, but still there is so much to say.
All in words of one syllable;
I love you.

In the Storm~
The storm rages on around you, the freezing winds and icy mists blowing
by, leaving behind a frigid signature of sleet and frost.  The gale blusters
onward, indifferent to the intruders in its midst.  The howling of the wind
is nearly deafening, the only noise louder being the crashes of thunder.  In
the bright flashes of lightning, you can make out the storm continuing to
the north, east, and south.

The air is unpleasantly wet, and the arctic winds blowing around you turn
the moisture into ice, making breathing a painful endeavor.  The dark clouds
beneath your feet rumble and boil, as if about to erupt, their murkiness
obscuring any hope of a view of the lands below.  Gusts of wind toss the
clouds below into even more of a frenzy, and blow you about as if you were
nothing more than a snowflake in a blizzard.  You can continue onwards
through the savage winds in all directions.

The clouds swirl in dark whirlpools of thunderheads and gloom, their inky
murk brightened to a dull lead grey as lightning flashes all around you. 
Between near utter blackness and noise to blinding moments of quiet, it is
nearly impossible to keep your bearings straight.  The wind blows past, hard
and cold, carrying with it almost crystalized water that beads into small
hard pellets on your clothing, forming an extra layer of protection, an
armor of ice.  The storm continues to the north, west and south, and you can
barely make out a rocky ledge to the east.

In the Storm~
The air is unpleasantly wet, and the arctic winds blowing around you turn
the moisture into ice, making breathing a painful endeavor.  The dark clouds
beneath your feet rumble and boil, as if about to erupt, their murkiness
obscuring any hope of a view of the lands below.  Gusts of wind toss the
clouds below into even more of a frenzy, and blow you about as if you were
nothing more than a snowflake in a blizzard.  The frozen chaos continues
around you in all directions.

The clouds swirl in dark whirlpools of thunderheads and gloom, their inky
murk brightened to a dull lead grey as lightning flashes all around you. 
Between near utter blackness and noise to blinding moments of quiet, it is

and cold, carrying with it almost crystalized water that beads into small
hard pellets on your clothing, forming an extra layer of protection, an
armor of ice.  The storm continues in all directions.

An Enclosed Meadow~
Strangely set among the solid rock surroundings of Mount Enrien is a
small meadow, growing lush and full in the dark soil contained here.  The
grass and blooms are glowing with health, and undisturbed by any wind,
protected by the surrounding mountain.  The sky is a crystal blue, and light
shines in from the east, the western part of the meadow having rooflike
stone covering it as the rock extends upwards.  This little cubbyhole of
nature protected in the mountain continues to the south, and a small path
can be seen going up the side of the rock, leading to a small platform of
some sort.

against it is uncomfortable, but the only way to keep your feet on this

higher and higher.  Further west is a small clearing of some sort, and back
down lies the calm tranquility of the meadow.

the occaisional tuft of grass.  The sun barely casts any light in here, the
rocky roof and small opening letting in very little of its brightness. 
Something seems to shift in the jagged shadows, but there is no further

You wet through and me headfirst
Into this it\@s perfect, it\@s all I ever wanted 
Ow! it feels so big it almost hurts..
 
Never guessed it got this good 
Wondered if it ever would 
Really didn\@t think it could

A Shadowy Alcove~
Standing in a narrow little space, you are surrounded in darkness.  To
the west is a tiny gap, leading to a small ledge overlooking a cavern of
blackness.  Light shines down from somewhere above, but it seems to almost
sink into the surrounding rock, leaving your lower half still immersed in
darkness.  Looking around, you can see faint marks in the wall, hand and
foot holds to climb upwards, into the mysterious brightness.

In the Waterfall~
All around you, water pours down, sparkling vividly in the sunlight
beyond.  The falls pour right over the invisible tunnel that seems to
protect this place, keeping the area dry.  Catching reflections, the water
droplets become thousands of tiny prisms, flashing past, casting bright
rainbows as they slide by.  The whole area seems alive with light and
colour, from the gurgling water and its light music, to the neverending
stream of liquid rainbows that surround you.  The strange tunnel leads
downwards, through the smooth rock into darkness, and upwards, stretching
beyond the waterfall into the sky.

Above the Waterfall~
The tunnel of force that leads downwards, shielding you from the
waterfall, extends up further here, leading to a shimmering bridge of mist. 
From here, you can see the woods of Nendor spreading outwards to the north,
and the ancient Mount Enrien, its reddish rock glowing dully in the sun. 
The waterfall merrily continues on below you, the surface of the water
seemingly unmarred by any sort of obstruction.

The Beginning of the Bridge~
You stand at the beginning of the bridge of mist, leading eastward
through the clouds.  The bridge seems contructed of vapor and faith, the
delicate span stetching out across the skies of Avendar.  Below, the trees
and hills seem rather small, and distant, though for the time spent
following the tunnel upward, you should not be this high up.  The tremulous
arches reach out and disappear into mysterious light, beckoning you to trust
and walk forward.  A set of pillars mark the entrance to the tunnel,
spiraling back down towards solid ground.

On a Bridge of Mist~
The bridge of mist stretches east and west from here, disappearing into

pillars of marble.  The ground seems to be quite solid, though it seems as
thin as tissue paper, and all around you swirl mists, leaving a cool wet
vapor trails over all it caresses.  A soft breeze stirs the air, and beckons

The bridge ends, decending into the clouds, and dissolving into mist
again.  The clouds drift by lazily, and are certainly not solid like the
bridge to the west.  Further east you can see a palace, with two elegant

A Sharply-Ascending Path~
A scarcely-traveled path climbs further up the mountain, punishingly
difficult to ascend.  Jagged rocks stand perilously close to the only
traversable path at all, threatening to fall lose upon lower reaches of the
mountain.  Southwards, the path eases as it grows closer to the meadow, and
dimly visible upwards, a flattened space seems to end the path.

A Forgotten Sanctuary~
The jagged rock of Mount Enrien opens onto a jutting, stony cliff.  Upon
it, an ancient circular platform sits, its once-flat surface uneven with the
passing of ages.  Tenacious weeds sprout up from between the brown rocks,
feathering parts of the crumbling shrine\@s surface with green.  Moss and
dirt cling to a high, shattered archway which bisects the platform, one
column rising on either edge.  It looks to have been toppled by some
powerful force, its thick, carved stone splintered across the cliff-side. 
At the center of the platform is a pool of water, jagged fragments of stone
surrounding it, but not penetrating its depths.  A dangerous mountain path
leads downward.

The archway of the sanctuary once stood over fifteen feet high, its stone
columns supporting its weight.  It now lies in ruins, the columns battered
but still standing.  Moss stubbles the cold rock, especially on the broken
pieces which lay scattered over the platform.  What appear to be moons can
still be seen on the arch\@s shattered surfaces, although their meaning and
purpose has been lost to the ravages of time.  
~
E
ancient circular platform~
This circular platform has been built upon the cliff with rocks from the
mountain itself.  Its outer edge contains large, apparently druidic signs,
which have been long-marred by weather and time.  Various stones have come
completely loose and are missing, while rich green moss, weeds and
wildflowers upturn those that remain.  At the center of the platform is a
standing pool of water, upon which plant and debris do not encroach.

A Shrine to Lady Rystaia~
You stand in a chamber, only made so by the white marble pillars
surrounding the room.  Besides those fluted columns, there are no walls, and
the pillars support no other roof than the crystalline blue sky.  The floor
seems to be made of glass, or a thin shield of some sort, transparent to
allow you to see the world of Avendar sprawling beneath you.  A gentle
breeze stirs the air, the winds cool fingers lightly brush your skin,
leaving behind a feeling of tingling refreshment.  An altar seems to almost
grow up from the floor, its intricate design smooth and flowing.  The whole
area glows with a silvery light, and a soft soothing music seems to echo all
around you, mingling with the far off sound of water.  The temple continues
to the north and south, and a small chamber of some sort lies to the west.

begin to form the faint image of a womans smiling face, but a second later

You are in a small chamber, surrounded by tall, intricately carved
pillars.  Set in the room are three glowing portals, each shimmering with
light as faint images pass behind them.  The first portal glows a soft gold,
and the pictures that shimmer past it seem fast and frequent.  The second
pulses with a dark blue aura, and seems to almost flicker from view.  The
third is a warm green, a blurred tree coming into view as the portal shifts
and changes.  A small tablet is carved into the smooth marble of the floor,
explaining where each portal travels to.  Aside from the portals, the only
exit from the room is east to the main part of the temple.

The Entrance to the Temple of the Pegasus~
The wispy clouds at this altitude solidify into a supportless platform,
made of a transparent, marble-like substance.  The air here is thin, but
instead of the unfettered winds of the open sky, it is a gentle, easy
breeze.  Pleasant scents and the faint hint of music drift out from the
vaguely crystalline structure rising from the western clouds.  Mist
enshrouds much of the area, both revealing and disguising the exact
surroundings and the world below.  The mist clears to the east into open
sky, while the solid path continues to the west.

Wisps of mist occasionally brush past your face as you move onward.  The
clouds beneath your feet move in an ever changing pattern, creating new
pictures in their depths for your imagination to find.  Northwards, the
spirit palace floats serenely among the clouds.  The eastern tower has
cracked, several bookshelves and a rotting corpse dangling from among the
shattered stonework.  Smoke and soot stain the stone above the windows,
doors, and balconies, and iron braces have been pierced through the exterior
in places.  

A faceted, lustreless bubble seems to enclose the entire palace, its
geometric faces giving it a decidedly crystalline appearance.  The bubble
does not react to anything it merely exists, preventing any access to or
from the palace.  The air inside the bubble roils, tinged with smoke. 
Colorless, insubstantial arcs of something that looks vaguely like lightning
flash and dance, radiating outwards from the top of the western tower.

shines in from the east, the western part of the meadow having rooflike

In the Clouds~
Wisps of mist occasionally brush past your face as you move onward.  The
clouds beneath your feet move in an ever changing pattern, creating new
pictures in their depths for your imagination to find.  The brightness makes
it a bit difficult to keep oriented, distracting and confusing with their
plays of shadow and light, but you can see the clouds continue to the north,
west and east.  South a large ledge juts out from the mountain, sturdy
ground to rest on.

In the Clouds~
Mist settles into your clothing, and leaves a fine layer of moisture over
you and all your possesions.  But the faint breeze is only slightly cooling,
as the sun shines down, keeping the area comfortably warm.  The beams of
light are almost tangible, reflecting through cloud and mist to the world
below.  The clouds flow along to the north, west and east.  South a large
ledge juts out from the mountain, sturdy ground to rest on.

In the Clouds~
The light reflecting everywhere is almost blinding, the whole area filled
with brightness.  Even the air seems to glow, little droplets of mist
shining in the sun.  Though it is sometimes hard to see very far beyond what
is surrounding you, you can tell the clouds continue to the north, west and
east.  South a large ledge juts out from the mountain, sturdy ground to rest
on.

In the Clouds~
Cloud and mist surround you, masking some sounds, or strangely echoing
others.  The sun burns holes into the surrounding vapor, leaving clear paths
for flight and view.  To the southwest, you can see the faint shadow of
Mount Enrien, the peak just barely cresting the waves of fog.  You can
continue through the haze in any direction.

An Enclosed Meadow~
Strangely set among the solid rock surroundings of Mount Enrien is a
small meadow, growing lush and full in the dark soil contained here.  The
grass and blooms are glowing with health, and undisturbed by any wind,
protected by the surrounding mountain.  The sky is a crystal blue, and light
shines in from the east, the western part of the meadow having rooflike
stone covering it as the rock extends upwards.  This little cubbyhole of
nature protected in the mountain continues to the east and south.
