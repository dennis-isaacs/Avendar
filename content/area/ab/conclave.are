Kalqaqab~
A small nefortu in unkempt robes, Kalqaqab is here.
~
This shifty looking nefortu scholar bears the robe of a scholar of the
Var Bandor guild of fire and void.  As an ambassador to Arisuth, Kalqaqab\@s
duties take him to the conclave proper.  Despite his office, his robes are
shabby and unkempt, smelling of soot and sweat.  His gray skin bears a
poorly-kept stubble.  Only his eyes are clear and alert, almost wholly
black.

Ieargan high templar~
Ieargan, the High Templar~
The High Templar of Arisuth, Ieargan, strides about his office.
~
The High Templar of the Conclave of Arisuth Ieargan is a stern,
harsh-seeming man.  His face is drawn and hollow and his tall, thin frame is
covered by glossy plates of midnight-colored armor.  Pale blonde hair sticks
up wispily from his scalp, waving as he moves.  A pair of hard blue eyes lie
within sunken sockets and glare unapprovingly about himself.  

As High Templar Ieargan commands the void templar guards of the Arisuth,
seeing to their dicipline and training with a harsh, iron fist.

Alhalis heart arisuth~
Alhalis~
Alhalis the Heart of Arisuth is here, a fanged maw yawning from his chest.
~
The Heart of Arisuth, Alhalis is the unquestioned ruler of the Conclave
by the will of Isetaton, Demon Sultan of the Void.  A mighty scholar of the
void, Alhalis rose to power decades ago within the tower.  By making pacts
with the demons of the Maze of Flesh he was able to solidify his position,
gaining the infernal powers of Isetaton for an inscrutable price.  

Alhalis was once darkly handsome, but close association with the powers of
the void have eaten away at him.  His hair is grey and wispy now and his
pupilless white eyes bear dark circles, but the most horrific result of the
touch is the maw.  Taking up the entirety of his upper torso, a great
wide-fanged maw gapes.  Surrounded by feverish and ropy grey flesh it
gibbers and chants, its yawning teeth revealing the darkness of the void.

member of the Aklaju.  Raphoh\@s position as liason between the two conclaves
sees him on business within the tower negotiating boons owed for the aid of
the Aklaju\@s wealth.  Delicate and noble features mark a statesman\@s face,

white, dappled with grey.

a greater void shade~
The inky silhouette of a winged humanoid floats here, absorbing the light. 
~
A humanoid shade of purest black hangs in midair here, a pair of great
unflapping inky wings arching from it.  It reflects nothing, instead
appearing to be a simple void of existence.  The shade appears to be the
midnight reflection of an angelic female when viewed from an angle, but even
this is difficult to tell, as the very being disappears into itself.  The
only thing to break the darkness of the tenebral being are a pair of
gleaming eyes, like molten gold, gazing hungrily from the void.  

An unnatural chill surrounds the void shade, as well as a tangible aura of
frustration.

Suzahme~
Suzahme, the librarian of the Arisuth, sits at his desk.
~
Suzahme, the librarian of the Conclave\@s tomes, sits at his desk calmly. 
His head is shaven and a pair of square-lensed spectacles rest on his face. 
His eyes bear no pupils, oddly enough, merely milky orbs.  He doesn\@t seem
sightless, however, as he tends to his paperwork.  He seems relaxed and at
ease in his position, an easy smirk pulling at his lips now and then.  

One of the only scholars in the tower who does not focus the majority of his
studies to the void, Suzahme rose to his position through donations, both
monetary and literary.

The thin frame of this shuddeni scholar is draped with a gaudily
bejeweled robe, its surface studded with large gemstones.  The robe is fixed
with a crest in the shape of a hexagon, a symbol apparently scored within. 
Despite the apparent weight of the overdecorated garb, the shuddeni wears it
without any obvious encumberment.  The eyeless face of the scholar drifts
between impatience and boredom as he looks about his surroundings.

A tall, coppery skinned aelin floats here, clad in black silk.
~
A willowy aelin regards her surrounding coolly through sharp green eyes. 
Her lithe form is clothed in billowy black silk, the dark raiments seeming
oddly cool.  Raven black hair falls to the small of her back, nary a stray
strand falling before her narrow, copper-toned face.  Well-chiseled features
adorn her face, cheekbones and nose well formed.  A tattoo of a black tear
bleeds down from her left eye, ceasing halfway down her hollow cheek.  Black
wings sprout from her back, finely groomed, keeping her aloft with steady
beats.

templar shuddeni Yithoul~
a templar of Yithoul~
A shuddeni templar is here, glaring watchfully about his surroundings.
~
This shuddeni templar is garbed in cruelly-fashioned armor, the designs
upon it marking him as a templar of the Yithoul tribe.  Unnecessary spikes
and razored edges decorate his well-fitted armor, making surprisingly little
sound when he moves.  His face is twisted into an impatient eyeless glare as
he surveys his surroundings, a sneer pulling at his lips.

Forfewl~
An aged, long-bearded scholar sits here, muttering absently.
~
A long white beard obscures much of this scholar\@s face.  Somewhat
befuddled by age, Forfewl has been relegated to the less demanding task of
overseeing the servants.  He spends much of his time murmuring to himself,
or imagined listeners, as he sits at the table, leafing through papers. 
From time to time he looks up to berate a passing servant- or nothing at
all.

An ethron scholar sits at the study table, writing intently.

This ethron sits hunched over a desk, intent on whatever it is he writes.
His skin is a pale green in sharp contrast to his vibrantly verdant hair. 
He wears a well-worn set of brown robes, the beaten garment fitting loosely
and comfortably about his still-muscular frame.  His blue eyes scan the page
as he continues to write, hints of weariness within them.

This ch\@taren woman is in the late stages of pregnancy by her appearance.
She lies upon the floor of her cell, chains binding her to it.  Several thin

Areruva aelin scholar assistant~
Areruva~
An aelin scholar sits at a table alone, silently looking over a parchment.
~
Areruva is one of the assistants to the Master Alchemist, hailing from
Earendam.  His face is sickly pale, albeit fine-boned and handsome.  Stringy
black hair falls about his face where his green eyes are set in tense
concentration.  He seems to have a nervous manner about him with a slight
facial tick and twitching brown wings.

An assistant to the Master Alchemist, this scholar rests, absorbed in

white.  He has a serious look about him, brow creased and his gaze intent as

A burn-scarred aelin scholar sits here, talking quietly.
~
The left side of this aelin\@s face bears an old, ugly burn scar.  His
left eye is milky and obviously useless, staring blankly at nothing.  In
contrast the other side of his face is notably handsome, with a keen brown
eye.  His well-sculpted nose is untouched, as are his thin lips.  His pale
blone hair is cut very short.  He seems intent on his conversation, speaking
in hushed tones.

This woman is clad in a revealing dress of black and purple silk which
clings attractively to her slim figure.  She stands silently as if waiting
for something, her hands folded behind her.  A mask of pure white porcelain
hides her face, its surface depicting a beautiful feminine face.  Holes
covered by clear crystal allow her green eyes to peer blankly out of the

Viara~
Viara, the Voice of Arisuth, lounges in her chambers.
~
Viara Malz, the Voice of Arisuth and Speaker for the Heart, is a
stunningly beautiful human woman.  Appearing to be in her middle years, time
has only added to her regal, mature beauty, rather than diminishing it.  Her
hair is a deep black that tumbles down about her shoulders and face in lush,
glossy curls.  Her face is fine-boned and delicate, with a pair of brilliant
green eyes set below her narrow midnight eyebrows.  Her full lips seem
curled into a faint smile as her eyes flash in a predatory fashion about her
surroundings.  

She is clothed from neck to ankle in a form-fitting dress of exceedingly
sheer black fabric, leaving little of her supple, well-endowed figure to the
imagination.  A hole fashioned into the dress reveals the skin of her
midriff, and about her neck she wears a necklace of thin platinum discs.

succubus demon amalgamation horror beauty viarasummonone~
a succubus~
An amalgamation of beauty and horror, a succubus hovers here.
~
A combination of features both horrific and beautiful, this initiate of
Pricina hovers before you on spined, batlike wings.  The succubus hovers
unclothed, her soft curves readily visible.  Visible too are her unnaturally
long fingers and toes, the digits elongating into piercing claws.  The flesh
of her hands and feet are black as pitch, a stark contrast to the skin of
milky white covering the rest of her body.  Where white flesh meets black,
the colors spatter into one another as they blend.  The skin of her face is
pulled tight over her skull, the gaunt appearance contrasting the pleasant
softness the rest of her body seems to have.  Her eyes also strike you as
unnatural, the pupils vertical slits, like a cats.  The eyes flash hungrily
as they dart, searching.

Incubus handsome horrible demon Viarasummontwo~
an incubus~
An incubus hovers here, both handsome and horrible.
~
A combination of features both horrible and handsome, this initiate of
Pricina hovers before you on spined, batlike wings.  The incubus hovers
unclothed, his leanly muscular body readily visible.  Visible too are his
unnaturally long fingers and toes, the digits elongating into piercing
claws.  The flesh of his hands and feet are as dark as midnight, a stark
contrast to the pale white skin covering the rest of his supple frame. 
Where the white flesh meets black, the colors spatter into one another
rather than blend.  The skin of his ferally handsome face is pulled tight
over his skull, gauntness inconsistant with the rest of his seemingly
healthy body.  His eyes are also unnatural with pupils like vertical slits
in a manner akin to that of a cat.  The eyes flash hungrily as they dart,
searching.

a void shade~
The black silhouette of a woman hovers here, absorbing the light.
~
A humanoid shape of purest black is here, hovering slightly above the
ground.  It reflects nothing, instead appearing to be a simple void of
existance.  The shade appears to be the midnight reflection of a woman when
viewed from an angle, but even this is difficult to tell, as the very being
disappears into itself.  Only one thing breaks the silhouette of inky
darkness, a pair of shining, mercurial eyes gazing hungrily from the void

The Gelgegulus is a looming humanoid demon standing nearly fifteen feet
tall with the support of repulsively bulging limbs.  Its quivering green
skin is slick and frog-like.  Beneath the flesh veins visibly pump whatever
foul ichor fuels the fiend.  Despite its great size its head is no larger
than a man\@s; however, there is no further similarity.  Instead, three pairs
of gleaming green-yellow eyes and a maw filled with crushing bone plates
surmount the creature\@s head.

Testirim the Crashy, King of the Testers, dispenses echoes.  Or echos.
~
Lord Anirim the Pure, King of the Titans, has ruled from his white throne
for 6,000 years. The seventh king of the Titan people, his reign has seen
the decline of their presence in this world. It is unknown exactly why the
Titans have withdrawn, or where they have gone, but intervention from the
Great Ones has been rare in the last hundred years.
Nevertheless, the White Castle is ever a gathering place for those of the
Light, and the throne of Anirim is crowded with rulers, kings, and sages,
seeking the council of the wisest being to dwell in physical form upon this
land.

a syndic of Khamurn~
(Bound) An insectoid syndic of Khamurn stands here silently.
~
Standing over eight feet tall, this insectoid syndic of the demon
magistrate Khamurn is well suited to its normal duties in the defense and
organization of Khamurn\@s court.  The demon has a sticklike, insectoid body,
complete with four independent arms.  Covering its body is a hard green
exoskeleton, and prehensile pincer-like hands are located at the end of each
of its lanky arms.  

Along with its blood-red compound eyes, the syndic has an impressive bundle
of antennas sprouting from the two nodes on its head.  The creature is
largely free of superfluous motion, except the constant twitching of the
antennae in response to otherworldly stimuli.  It wears no formal armor, but
is draped in fine purple silks of its office.  Each of its arms bears either
a sword or a shield, which it holds at ready.

A tall, muscular demon, this monstrosity is a warrior of the demon city
of Chaigidon.  Overlapping green scales cover the body of the Chaigidonian,
and its face is almost reptilian, which is no doubt evidence of the
ascendancy of the warlord Zyal.  In addition to formidable claws, teeth, and

hammer aramril long handled long-handled iron sapphires lightmace~
the Hammer of Aramril~
A long-handled iron hammer set with carved sapphires waits here.~
This hammer is without a doubt the sacred weapon of Aramril the Martyr. 
It is forged in the ancient style of Dolgrael\@s human forgewrights, who
flourished in the age preceding the War of Fire.  It is said that this
hammer was his personal weapon during the War, and that he carried it with
him on the long journey to rouse the Father of the Seas.  The twin carved
sapphires are said to have been a gift from Jolinn, infusing the hammer with
powerful magic.  After his death, the hammer was cherished as a relic of the
newly-formed Champions of Avendar.  

The hammer\@s final famous battle was during the War of Night.  The Champion
leader of that era, Amiraiya the White, is said to have wielded it in the
battle with the dread Tzet-Sabanthe.  However, while the Champions fought
with faith and valor, their heroics bought little time against the ferocious
onslaught.  It is unclear as to if she survived the encounter or not; some
records suggest her death as a martyr, while others say she led her
Champions to safety.  They agree on one point: that the hammer was lost in
the fray, thought never to be recovered.  

Legends say that the hammer can surround the wearer with a barrier of white
light, when one calls out, \#Jolinn\@s hand protect me from evil.\#

first~
We arrived at the keep after climbing through the ancient forests.  Hoary
branches barred our way and great wolves dogged our steps, but we have
arrived.  Like a black gauntlet the castle seems to stab from its peak,
looming on its overlook it seemed to know we were coming and cared not.  How
could we possibly pose any threat to such a thing?  Such tiny fleeting
beings we are.  Such tiny fleeting beings.

You finally arrive at another page.  It is partially unreadable, but
notes writ in the margins help you put together the narrative again.  

Mordal is dead.  The ropes took him up into the towers and he is dead.  We
are huddled now, in the deep closets.  More like passages than closets but
the robes are hung all along these halls.  They move and intersect and
perhaps even change, but I am so very worried I might imagine as much. 
Wispy things chase us now, and we must escape.  Deeper into the closets, we
run.  Ever deeper, but where will they end?

Claran was dragged to the deep chambers, where the mists of the damned swirl

of this hellish place.  That such a castle could exist, could climb so high
as to touch the heavens and plunge so deep as to scrape the hells..  Where
have we gone and what horrors have we brushed?  I am near the gates now, and
I have escaped.  Valdk sacrificed himself for as much and I must honor that.
I can only pray he is dead, but I will write, and the centuries shall bear

\#The Conclave of the Arisuth\#

The Arisuth formed after the pall of the War of Night had lifted from the
world above and the stigma of Void Magic had lifted enough for guilds to
form.  

The guilds of the void found themselves beset by suspicion in the wake of
the war, and could not easily conduct their dark studies without scrutiny or
violence.  The leaders of the guilds met in secret and concieved of a remote
location that they might continue their experiments unfettered by the moral
concerns of others.  

Distance was no object to those who might rend reality and step through
countless leagues with a thought, and in the heart of the Mlejian Mountains,
the Conclave was built.  

The Void Guilds pool their research and resources within the tower under the
oversight of the Heart of the conclave; the supreme scholar within the
tower.  The Speaker for the Heart speaks his will to those who are beneath
the Hearts presence, which is all save the Speaker.  

The remote nature of the Conclave allows us to achieve great works without
the meddling of other guilds.  Within these Mlejian Mountains we are
unassailable.  The old trails are blocked by landslides and gating is the
only practical manner of travel to us.  

Our studies shall test the void and the veil.  Let none stand before Arisuth
and the Guilds of the Void.

Chapter One: The Dark Pond- The Void Ripple Theory.  

It has been surmised that the channeling of the void for the purpose of
casting creates ripples within the space of the void.  While many of the
lesser castings, simple maledictions and calls for knowledge, cause
insignificant disturbances, other more powerful incantations create
noticable ripples.  

For the most part, these ripples have little effect upon our craft.  It
raises interesting possibilities, however.  If this proves true, it may
allow for the detection of other spells cast by fellow void scholars.  Some
have said that the true reason for the harmful effects of the spells of
\@gate\@, \@nexus\@ and \@phase door\@ are due to the disturbance caused by the
ripples of the casting.  I suspect this to be untrue, however.  The effects
of remaining within the void upon living matter would most likely be
detrimental.  There have been reports of people cast into the void while
under magical observation.  The subjects were reported to suffer no ill
physical results, but began to gibber madly.  They soon began to repeat some
incomprehensible phrase in desperation before they were apparently unmade. 
The claim that no physical harm was incurred is interesting.  Perhaps
survival within the Void would be possible, if the mental degeneration could
be avoided.  

The chapter continues, putting forth ideas on survival within the void.  
~
E
2~
Chapter Two: Demonic Resonance- Could Demonic Summoning be Refined?  

It is theorized that certain ripples resonate with the inhabitants of the
void.  The incantation sends out a ripple that beckons demons to enter this
realm.  The apparent randomness of demonic summoning suggests that these
demons are all clustered approximately the same distance away from the veil.
One wonders what may lie beyond the simple demons we now call.  Perhaps if
were able to somehow delay the effects of the ripples, or make them
undetectable to certain beings within the Void, we could find greater powers
to bind and call forces with more accuracy 

The summoning of Greater Demons is perhaps an example of this.  Have we
incidentally hit upon a way to slip the resonating ripples past the weaker
powers of the void?  If we have, how deep do we penetrate?  Are we ignoring
other demons between the lesser and the greater?  Many questions are raised.
With the refining of the summoning process, answers might be found.  

The chapter continues, giving forth proposals to streamline the summoning
process.  
~
E
3~
Chapter Three: Black Swells- The Result of Ripple Interference.  

There have occasionally been reports of aberrant results to rituals and
spells involving the void.  While many are the results of inept handling of
compenents or mispronounciation of an incantation, several incidents can not
be so simply explained away.  It is believed that when several powerful
ripples meet, it can cause a turbulance of sorts within the void, to
oft-unpleasant results.  Many cases of mispossesion and missummonings have
been credited to such.  Incidents of void scholars being stuck within the
other body and negation of personality are discussed in length in a treatise
by one of my contemperaries, Rzkakiz.  

Missummonings are noteably less common, but usually more dramatic.  Jyraka,
a high wizard of the Yithoul tribe, reportedly attempted to summon a runaway
slave back to the temple.  Despite a reportedly flawless circle, the spell
went awry.  The result was the chaja being summoned into her body, the two
merging into a formless mass.  The resulting dissection showed the bodies
had indeed fused.  At the time, no less than 3 nexuses had been opened
around the cavern.  

The chapter continues, giving many more gruesome examples of failed
summonings.

{WVoid Shades, a Treatise{x by Molodr Felpawn, Void Magus.  

To travellers within the void, and the summoners of its denziens, the void
shade is a familiar sight.  Black humanoid or animal shades that flit
noiselessly through the murk and drain the warmth from their victims with a
chilling touch.  Their origin however is not well known, and may come as a
notable surprise to dedicants of the dark magics.  

Void shades are the spirits of those sacrificed in the black ceremonies of
the void, their souls consigned to a hellish unlife beyond the veil.  It is
through our very works that they are created.  Certainly the animal shades
are the most plentiful, so often do they fall under our ritual knives, but
their faint spark of spirit makes for a weak beast in death.  Humans
sacrifice is less common, but humanoid void shades still stalk the void with
their quicksilver eyes.  

Rarest of all is the greater void shade, the tormented and trapped spirit of
a celestial being of the spirit trapped within the darkness.  Precious few
of the beings have been subdued and slain in ritual slaughter.  Those
spirits that become shades are the most terrible of all this manner of
creature.  Their golden eyes seek release, and will throw themselves into
battle without provocation.  

If there were some manner to bind such creatures, what fearsome allies they
would be!  For now, we research our materials, signs and spells for the key
to breaking them to our will.

{WDemonic Bindings.  {x

Close study of the histories of the Void Templar\@s most potent ability

{WHunger of Grmlarloth{x

Weak, by any standard, in a straight up battle, the wisdom of its use was
best shown by Zyal, a void templar raider of singualar power.  He and his
forces assaulted a village, taking captive the women and children.  When the
Champions arrived, he slew them all himself, feeding the demon in his glove.
After slaughtering one of his rogues for good measure, the forces of light
were no match for that hellish blade.  

{WDefilement of Logor{x

Potent void templars are often forced to match blows with sanctuary-protected
water mages but the defilement of Logor evens the odds.  Yet the popularity
of Vershak blades makes its use a notable surprise, especially when the
switch comes unexpectedly.  The potent Benakk, hounded by goodly water
templars, bound the defilers into his spiked gauntlets.  When his own axe
was chilled from his grasp by his templar foe, his mailed fist punched
through the white aura, stunning the templar long enough for Benakk to
regain his advantage.

{WCaress of Pricina{x

The advantage of stealing the life force of your foe is obvious, but best
used in supplement to a strong defence.  Evenly matched against a
swordmaster foe, the noted templar Ilae retreated into a defensive
swordform, and took up a cursed whip as her secondary weapon.  The leeching
effect of the whip proved the deciding factor in the battle of attrition as
her foes life supplemented her own.  

{WBlade of Vershak{x

The use of the Vershak blade is obvious, of course, extra strikes always
welcome in the field of battle.  Cleverly, Tlkhanu made note that a
poisoned blade striking many times would weaken even the strongest foe in
short order.  He would often assault foes with asp strikes,
vershak-quickened poison and waves of miasma to bring his foes to their
knees.  

{WJaws of the Idcizon{x

Perhaps our most beloved trapping of our art, the Idcizon is almost
indispensible.  Most useful against an unarmed foe, weaking your enemy to
the point they lose their weaponry aids the jaws in their devouring
immeasurably, as numerous void templars have discovered.

{WDemonic Bindings.  {x

Close study of the histories of the Void Templar\@s most potent ability
reveals that there is wisdom to be had in a strategic choosing of ones
demonic bindings.  This brief folio will succintly expound upon the
historical accounts of their practical use.

The Tower and Symbolism.  

By Master Vorgnen, Mason and Architect

Since the gods granted the gift of thought to the races of Avendar, they
have built hovels, then homes then great palaces and towers.  Towers are
symbols of enlightenment.  Of a yearning to reach a greater plane, to touch
the divinity of the gods overhead.  The Ancient Alatharya sought this, and
were cast down for their arrogance, but yet still the races build.  

The tower seeks the heavens, and is a passage to it.  The tower is a symbol
of ascendance.  Why build a mean, sprawling complex, low to the earth and
stable, when you might dream toward the heavens?  The ch\@taren spires
gloriously reflect this.  Their beauty befitting of a race of dreamers.  The
aelin too seek the sky, but such beings are born to touch it.  Flying
cities, they crafted, soaring over the plains west of the Lidreau sea.  

The shuddeni best illustrate my point, I believe.  If the goodly races build
toward the encompassing heavens, toward what damnation do those eyeless
wretches beneath the earth dig?  

What, then, is the meaning of a tower of darkness?  Is it a challenge? 
Arisuth is a creation of unity between the civilized forces of the void.  Is
the tower itself a symbol of unity between the heavens and the hells as well
as earth and sky?  All these questions bear thought and consideration.

On Combating the Magics of the Spirit.  

Powered by the foul powers of goodness, the magic of spirit templars and
scholars has proven a thorn in our side since its introduction to our plane.
Let us recall the day of Two Dawns!  Blast them!  Those scabrous whelps! 
Those golden-skinned upstarts!  Who are they to stand in the way of our
destiny?  Why, on their entire race a pox...  

(This rhetorical ranting continues for several pages before the author\@s
vitriol is spent on the subject of his hate for the ch\@taren race.)  

Despite their despicable nature, they won the War of Night.  They defeated
us with their spirit magics, but why?  The answer lies in the nature of our
arcane defenses and their inherent weakness.  The cloak of the void and the
form of the wraith fend off all damage save that of a holy nature.  They
make us, in fact, more vulnerable to the accursed magics.  Even the fearsome
demonic possession of a void templar renders him weak as a babe to blessed
assaults.  They can unbind our demons and turn them against us!  They can
call on more mana when we siphon theirs!  Their blessings protect them from
our maledictions!  Their true-sight can pierce our walk of the void!  

We can combat this, however.  Here is a list of ways we can overcome their
assaults- 

(The paper mentions something about superior numbers, but trails off into
colorful and violent ways to take revenge on the ch\@taren as a race.  The
remainder of the book does not seem to offer any practical advice.)

A heap of midnight blue silk lies here.~
You recognize the craft of an affluent harrudim merchant from centuries
past.  Paranoid of mind-readers, he had several robes made to help protect
him from psionicists.  He soon made a handy profit selling such things to
those with similar fears.  

Ironically, it was his robes that brought his end upon him.  Several psions
unravelled the mystery of who was providing clothing to be used against
them, and the merchant\@s fortunes took a dramatic turn for the worse.

While such sympathetic magic strengthens Ksaukach, the bond could also be
used to weaken him, if properly manipulated by one knowledgable in breaking
down void magic.

Charcoal can call forth the idcizon, whose jaws may be bound to serve
within a shield.  Such jaws will fight, desiring evermore to be fed mortal
flesh.  Bone dust can call forth the vershak from its home in Selb-Kar,
whose celerity will enhance the rate at which the bound weapon may strike. 
Mud can call forth the scion of Oame, spawn of Igray\@iitu of the Thirteen,
whose chill will preserve you against the disciples of the Seas.  Salt will
conjure the grmlarloth, whose imbued hunger will strengthen your successive
blows when they strike.  It will be your own blood which calls forth the
daughters of lust, whose relentless desire will fuel your life while you
fight.  Finally, silver dust will allow the binding of the minions of Logor,
whose defiling power will pierce the holy protection of sanctuary.  Should
you attempt other materials, expect nothing more than woe at your failure,
and the snickers of your still-living colleagues.  
~
E

The second difference is a bit more esoteric.  While the Aklaju seek
symbols that are attuned to the locales of the Void, binding rituals require
only the rudimentary Trigon of Binding.  The magic performed, and the
material in which the Trigon is scribed, will supply the necessary direction
for the gateway.  This is, in part, because the spells have been refined
over countless centuries by minds far greater than our own.  It is also
because of some not altogether clear link between the material used and the
locale sought.  Those of you who have collegues within the Aklaju may
recognize some similarities in reagents between the two guilds.  However,
this should not be entirely relied upon, as summoning rites do not
necessarily align with bindings.  Thus, one should keep in mind the
following deliniation of material components.  
~
E
book3~
The first and most important difference is one of procedure.  With the
Aklaju pacts, it is taken as a point of fact that, at least to some degree,
conjured demons consent so long as they are paid.  Why this is has been the
subject of scholarly debate for centuries, positing theories ranging from
the involvement of the ancient alatharya, to the nature of the Thirteen, and
finally, the suggestion that perhaps demons just particularly desire the
baubles they are given.  Why this is so is irrelevant for our purposes. 
Binding rituals, contrarily, are not subject to the consent of the creatures
being called.  They are pulled through the Silver Veil to the Prime
Material, and at that point, the exactitude of the symbol and the power of
the caster can entrap them into the desired object.  Demons so bound will
not bide their confinement well, and should they escape from their earthly
prison, they will seek vengeance.  In such an event, it is best to be
proficient in survival, lest they break your body and return with it to the
Void, where it will no doubt serve as a delicious snack.  
~
E
book2~
As many of you are no doubt aware, the binding rituals performed are not
so far removed from the summoning rites observed by our Aklaju brethren. 
However, there are some important differences that every binding novice
should keep in mind.  Remember these words, for if you do not, you will find
yourself in dire peril.

a dome of ice carved with depictions of the freeing of Jolinn by the great
heroes of the War of Fire.  Shown prominantly is the first of the Penguin
Kings, Smartae, leading the heroes to Jolinn\@s prison and the fire devils
therein.

weaponry and armor.  There are several ensconced torches along the walls,
making the room warm and smoky.  The smell of sweat lingers in the stuffy
air, making the atmosphere uncomfortable.  A hallway leads north from the
training chamber.

beneath magical burners, vapors filling the room with a harsh, chemical

Serval small tables of sturdy oak lie in this end of the laborotory, odd
glass an metal apparatus on most of them.  The vapors of the bubbling
liquids being heated fill the air with a harsh, chemical smell.  Dozens of
cages are stacked on the western wall, containing all manner of small

even the odd monkey are kept as well.  A heavy iron door is set in the

the air with the faint scent of roses.  They are nestled in slender black
steel candle holders scattered about the edges of the room, rising several
feet from the floor.  An ebony vanity rests against the eastern wall bearing
a large mirror, a single cushioned chair before it.  A plush, black-sheeted
bed lies against the southern wall, a spidery black canopy hanging above it.
A curtain of dark silk hangs to the north.

The Audience Chamber~
The black stone floor of this great circular chamber has been polished to
a mirror finish.  A slender length of deep purple carpet runs from a set of
large ebony double-doors at the northern end of the room, extending to a
raised dais at the southern end of it.  Upon the dais sits a single chair
formed of the same dark rock of the tower, its surface decorated with runed
silver.  At the back of the dais, to the south, a single door of runed ebony
is set into the wall.

Before a Cramped, Narrow Staircase~
This small antechamber houses a narrow stairwell.  Nothing adorns the

A Dimly Lit Chamber~
A dim red-gold light illuminates this room, shed by a glowing
ch\@lonin-veined stone.  A sheet of thin red silk is draped about the stone,
perverting its soft light.  Below the ceiling-set light a single round table
stands, a chair nearby.  Neither piece of furniture bears mark or rune,
appearing to be of simple make.  

The circular walls of this room have been carved into disturbingly fleshy
shapes in stark contrast to the glass-like stone floor.  Nesting within the
obscene organic murals, hints of vaguely unsettling forms seem to lie,
almost appearing alive.  Into the walls four doors are set, each of them
equidistant from the next.

A Dimly Lit Bedchamber~
This dim chamber is dominated by the large canopy bed in its center. 
Carved expertly and beautifully from dark ironwood, the wooden frame holds
aloft an inky canopy of black silk.  The silk seems to flow of its own
accord, waving despite the still air.  Soft sheets of deep, rich purple
complimented by black pillows lie upon the mattress.

A table of dark ironwood stands against the northern wall of this

implements.  The quiet sounds of dripping and bubbling liquid sound from the
many glass containers as magical fires continue to burn beneath the
apparatus.  On the opposite wall, a shelf stores unused equipment, as well
as cooling vials and the odd tome or research note.  A runed door made of
black stone, seemingly the same as that which forms the tower, is set into
the western wall and an ebony door lies to the east.

A Summoning Chamber~
In the center of this circular chamber of black stone, a great pentagram
is engraved into the floor.  Along and within it, countless binding runes
and glyphs are graven and the entire symbol nearly pulses with negative
energy.  The harsh, alien odor is strong here and the walls of the room are
slick with wetness.  The sole exit from this place is a door of runed black
iron to the west.

A Musty, Fetid Hallway~
The air of this black-stoned hallway is stale and filled with a foul,
alien odor.  A dampness fills the air and droplets of moisture have formed
on the cool walls and floor, making the surfaces gleam in the flickering
torchlight.  Inset into the western wall is a heavy door wrought of black
iron, yet blacker runes and glyphs enscribed upon its surface.  More such
doors are visible as the hallway extends to the south.

and writing instruments lying upon it.  Behind the desk, to the north, a
bookshelf stands filled with various catalogs and tomes.  On either wall to

portraying a dark, if beautiful, scene.  Inset into the southern wall is a

make sits aside each bed, all of them bearing a brass candle holder.  Unlit
candles sit in a few of the holders, a number melted but some yet fresh and
unburned.  The black-stoned walls are undecorated and a heavy wooden door is
