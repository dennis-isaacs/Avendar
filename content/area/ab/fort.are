Petrasen healer human monk male man~
Petrasen~
Petrasen, Kor Thrandir\@s priest of Jolinn, stands upon the dais.
~
Petrasen is the most respected priest within the city of Kor Thrandir,
and tends the sapphire altar of Jolinn within its temple.  He is older,
balding, and what thin hair remains is a wispy grey.  A member of the line
of Nargas, his destiny from birth was entwined with house Thrandir, and by
extension, the city which shares its name.  As a young man, he took over for
his father, leading the keep\@s religious services and offering aid to the
injured.  Although no longer young, powerful magic is a part of his
heritage, and he studies regularly to maintain his skill.

The red-haired Krunnet works behind the counter.

A red-haired man named Krunnet tends the Kor Thrandian weaponry, his skin
dotted with freckles.  He is fit and trim, and his face is clear of stubble.
The son of one of Major Chartoff\@s fallen comrades, he grew up in Var
Bandor.  He became interested in smithing, and began working as an
apprentice when he was a teenager.  After honing his skills, he traveled to
Kor Thrandir to learn more about his father\@s legacy.  He decided to stay
after speaking with the Major, and plies his trade forging the endless array
of weapons needed to arm the Lord Protector\@s army.  He seems congenial even
while working.

Peblenn~
Peblenn watches the general store, stomach bulging.
~
Peblenn is a broad-shouldered, overweight man with a bulging stomach.  He
has beady black eyes and a stringing brown beard.  Once a famous hunter
throughout the Brintor mountains, he supplied Kor Thrandir with meat and
pelts for a number of years.  Eventually, he grew weary of adventuring, and
bought a small house within the city.  He eventually purchased the general
store, and quickly accomodated to quiet and profitable days.  Although his
attitude is still gruff, his hunting prowess has slackened along with his
figure.  He spends his days watching the store, looking at its trophies as a
reminder of his youth.

Since the passing of his teacher, Jerent has continued to forge armor for
the Lord Protector\@s army, and sells individual pieces to adventurers in
need of protection.  He has become a fixture within the keep, faithfully

Chajada~
Chajada, the caladaran apothecary, sells cures for common ailments.
~
Chajada is a young caladaran woman who operates the Kor Thrandian
apothecary.  She is thick-trunked and plain, with deep brown skin and thick,
moss-green hair.  She once considered studying with the healers of Salyra,
before realizing a difficult reality: she could only be so many places at
once, and thus, could only help so many.  Intrigued by the possibilities of
creating portable cures, she began a lengthy study of herbal cures and
tonics.  Realizing that her studies would cease without resources, she
opened a shop in Kor Thrandir.  She works with the army physician, Phirayis,
to ensure that soldiers are swiftly cured.

Nadisius scholar short man lame ktshop~
Nadisius~
Nadisius rests upon a stool, examining a parchment.
~
A small man with a lame leg, Nadisius rests upon a wooden stool.  His
brown eyes are soft and inquisitive, and his hair is wispy and dark.  Born
without use of his left leg, he was of little use to the Kor Thrandian
military.  He vigorously pursued the study of magic, including the rudiments
of alchemy.  His personal acumen was not especially great, but his business
sense turned out to be quite keen.  He purchased the Scholar\@s Pen from its
previous owner, and lessened its reliance on scrolls in favor of simple but
useful potions.  Now wealthy, he commands notable respect within the keep.

Hargon Dellian~
Hargon Dellian stands behind the bar, looking at you expectantly.
~
Hargon Dellian is a stout human with a dull red beard.  His stomach is
uncharacteristically large for Kor Thrandir, and he walks with a distinct
limp.  Once a fighting man of the keep, he was crippled while on an
offensive against the shuddeni.  The Lord Protector allowed him to resign
his commission for his meritorious service and stay within the town.  He
took over the day to day operations of the Inn of the Northern Lights, to
the delight of his comrades.  These days, he keeps a vigilant eye out for
troublemakers and potential customers alike.

A slender aelin man garbed in dark silks, Alaetan serves as the retainer
to the noble house Eolodeu.  He is tall, with dark eyes and hair, much of it
tied back with a black silk ribbon.  Although his look is certainly a noble
one, he carries himself with a deftness that could not help but raise
suspicion.  Tasked with the protection of Eaolar, he accompanied his master
to Kor Thrandir, and found his assignment prolonged indefinitely.  Rumor
suggests that he is one of the few personal friends of the infamous thief,
Telara Nadyr.

Lieutenant Commander Velitius~
Lieutenant Commander Velitius stands here, barking orders to his troops.
~
A savage looking man with sunbeaten skin, Velitius is one of Kor
Thrandir\@s primary field marshals.  He is tall, muscular, and tough, his
head shaved and face reddened from exposure.  He has a prominent scar over
one eye, which he received in the defense of the keep during the Eyeblight
War.  He has a notorious reputation for his rigorous exercise regimen and
no-excuses attitude, which made him a favorite of the Lord Protector.  He
spends most of his days and nights on the training grounds, overseeing young
soldiers as they hone their skills.

Colonel Eanaar~
The dark-skinned aelin, Eanaar, waits within his office.

A tall and reedy aelin, Eanaar is among Avendar\@s greatest swordsmen. 
His frame is slight and his expression calm, and his skin is unusually dark.
This, paired with his matching wings and hair, give him an unquestionably
foreign look.  A son of house Alenori, he studied swordplay in the desert
city of Ashta Harrud.  His immense skill made him something of a local
legend, before he made the long journey to Kor Thrandir to thwart the
shuddeni.  He established the School of the Shining Blade, and holds an
honorary title within the Lord Protector\@s ranks.

esay adds Highly purified and blessed, however, to the point where it may not be inappropriate to name it as a different  substance entirely.
esay continues It took a great smith of the Light to accomplish this process.  A templar of the earth, whose name has been  lost to time.
say One of Vysara\@s companions?  students? and a warrior-priest of the Order of Aramril.
esay states This templar, blessed by the touch of the Lord Jolinn himself, disappeared centuries ago.
say Little is known about him.  All I have heard, myself, are legends of his inhuman patience.
esay muses It is said that he meditated for an entire month before the crafting of the elirium which bands the Staff.
emote appears lost in thought for a long moment.
esay \@shakes his head sadly, saying\@ Yet that is past.  As to the third element of the Staff, I can perhaps give you some  concrete information.
esay chortles Or at least more than these fables and bedside tales.
emote rolls up his sleeves.
esay \@lectures with confidence\@ As the elirium is mystical mei\@tzec, worked and re-worked a thousand times,
esay lectures So can the Staff impart this virtue to mortal materials.  For the energy required to imbue such amazing metal  with blessings -
esay continues - even once - is simply astounding.  Who knows how many lifetimes\@ worth of energy are bound into the Staff?
esay considers Convocations of spirit scholars, helping the templar to bring the wills and hopes of the Thrantian Alliance to  bear in one staff.
say For each and every man, woman, and child; their hope was given form in the Staff of Vysara.  Each thought, each blessed  intention, manifested and multiplied by the others.
esay \@says gravely\@ In your hands, $N, you bear that collective Gift, giv\@n form and power.  Use it well, as those who  sacrificed for it intended, or it shall become as a blight in your arms.
mpbitset $f 339 1
\@Should you have need of a great Sanctification or blessing, the staff shall reply to your call.
pmote whispers quietly to $F in hushed tones, speaking of words of light and sacrifice.
mpechoat $f You feel an understanding of the staff\@s spirit magic.
tell $f In combat, the Staff can bring some of the wrath of the spiritplane to bear on your opponent.
tell $f I recommend not wasting its power thus, but it is for you to decide.
esay \@voices aloud\@ In a tight spot, though, invoking Vysara\@s blessing may pull you and your allies to temporary safety.
ooc $f You now know how to \#invoke vysara spirit\#.  Spirit sanctuary can only happen if you are not in combat.
esay adds I will imagine the Staff is to play a crucial part in the hallowing of the Vault, for it is destroyed and desecrated.
emote steps back, folding his hands once more.
emote closes his eyes for a moment, praying briefly.
esay expresses May the Light preserve us all in these dark times.  For now, I ...I go to hold the Seal.
emote squares his shoulders resolutely, striding sadly from the room.
mpgoto 17179
emote has arrived.

Phirayis~
A caladaran scholar of Salyra maintains the infirmary.
~
Phirayis is a lanky caladaran who attends the Kor Thrandian infirmary. 
His limbs are long but not frail, and his grey-green hair hangs limply down
his back.  A scholar of Salyra, he traveled from Earendam to fill the post
after the passing of the previous physician.  His patience and care have
made him fairly popular within the keep, with humans and ch\@taren alike.  He
maintains a correspondance with Drajasi of the Hakurah Monastery, which has
led soldiers to tease him about the caladaran mating ritual.  He weathers it
with good humor, ever diligent in his tasks.

Telara Nadyr striking aelin woman thief~
Telara Nadyr~
A striking aelin woman with black hair lingers in the shadows.
~
Telara Nadyr is Kor Thrandir\@s most notorious thief and lauded by many
within the underworld as a master of disguise.  Her face is delicate and
striking, and her hair is black and scandalously short.  Her origin is
shrouded in mystery; some say she is a political exile, while other claim
she is a shuddeni spy.  She has evaded the efforts of the Kor Thrandian
Guard for a number of years through stealth and trickery.  Her devilish
smile is rumored to be able to charm even the toughest soldier, and her
fingers deft enough to rob a prince\@s coffer with ease.

A four-winged seraphic seal warden patrols the chamber.

A four-winged seraph patrols slowly above the Mystic Seal, tall and

eyes bear no pupils.  He is bald, his scalp smooth and glossy, and lacks
eyebrows, stubble, or other facial hair.  Although not overly muscular, he
stands over ten feet tall, making him particularly imposing.  He wears a

Archmage Shilrin~
Archmage Shilrin sits here in contemplation.
~
An older ch\@taren woman, Archmage Shilrin is a legend among legends.  She
is famed throughout Avendar as one of the greatest Spirit teachers to ever
live, and stories of her presence or action span untold lifetimes.  Despite
this renown, her frame is average at best, and her golden skin and pale hair
do little to suggest her spectacular reputation.  Her demeanor is a pleasant
one, her silver eyes aflame with immense mystical power.  

Although she once presided over the Spirit Palace above Mount Enrien, the
attack of the Scourge displaced her to the Order of the Silver Light in
Earendam.  With the War\@s close, Lord Protector Malyn offered her permanent
residence within Kor Thrandir.  She accepted, assuming the role of
spiritmaster for the flagging Nora Memorial Hall.  Now, she again instructs
young scholars in the ways of Spirit magic, helping them unlock their latent
potential.

Deshmin ch\@taren spirit templar man ktguildmaster ktguild~
Deshmin~
Deshmin, the legendary ch\@taren spirit templar, is here.
~
A proud and experienced ch\@taren, Deshmin has seen more than his fair
share of battle.  However, these trials have not worn on his personality,
which remains thoroughly friendly.  Despite his demeanor, he is a powerful
templar, and dedicated to both Rystaia and the Vaialan Aivei Lm\@keh.  His
build is impressive for a ch\@taren, but still slight when compared with
other races.  His golden skin bears some battle-scarring, but on the whole
has not really left him worse for wear.

Siqeth rotund ethron cook~
Siqeth~
Siqeth, the rotund ethron cook, oversees the mess hall kitchen.
~
A heavyset ethron, Siqeth tends the mess hall of Kor Thrandir.  He is a
pale green, with curly black hair and a broad, congenial face.  Although he
works for the local army, he was never a military man; instead, he traveled
from city to city, looking for a place to ply his skill as a chef.  When he
approached Hargon Dellian about taking him on as a cook, he was turned down.
After seeing the disgusting gruel of the mess hall, he petitioned the Lord
Protector to take over for the sake of morale.  His request was granted,
giving him dominion over the dining experience of countless troops.

Ashaeli Calaia~
A stoic ch\@taren woman with dark golden hair offers her wares.
~
Ashaeli Calaia is a stoic ch\@taren woman who serves the Aivei Lm\@keh. 
Her hair is a long fall of dark gold, its straight, shimmering cast only
enhancing her already otherworldly presence.  She is fit and strong, clearly
revealing her dedication to her lifestyle as a servant of the martyr-God,
Vaialos.  She was born in Avayn, the ch\@taren Haven of Ice, where she grew
strong in the ways of magic and war.  In the wake of the failures of the
Eyeblight War, Lord Protector Malyn asked her to come to Kor Thrandir to
teach his forgemen how to create more effective armor.  She agreed, largely
because of the encouragement of her childhood idol, Deshmin.

Melaith towering human man barbarian~
Melaith~
The towering, black-maned Melaith is here, ready for battle.
~
A huge and muscular man, Melaith is among the most famous of Kor
Thrandir\@s warriors.  His hair is an unruly black mane, and his features are
sharp and hawkish.  His dark eyes bear a ferocious cast, and his many scars
attest to his experience.  As a child, he was rescued from the shuddeni
slave pens by an expedition led by Lord Protector Malyn.  In time, he would
grow immensely in strength, and quickly advanced in the Kor Thrandian
military.  Feeling indebted to his savior, he has devoted his life to
guarding Malyn, and serves as his right hand in war.

Eaolar Eolodeu aelin representative~
Eaolar Eolodeu~
Eaolar, a regal, dark-haired aelin, rests in his chamber.
~
Clad in vibrant silks and fine linens, Eaolar is a regal aelin from the
distant city of Ilodaiya.  His age is middling, although his appearance has
a youthful cast inherent to pampering.  His short, black hair is
immaculately styled, and his curved ears are arrayed with precious earrings.
A son of the noble house Eolodeu, he was sent by the Senate to Kor Thrandir
to represent aelin interests in the longstanding conflict with the shuddeni.
With the close of the Eyeblight War, his station has become mandatory, and
his demeanor has suffered for it.

Caieth Valiir scholar representative var bandor man~
Caieth Valiir~
The white-bearded Caieth Valiir studies in his room.
~
A slight man, Caieth Valiir is wizened and bent with age.  His kindly
face is lined with creases, and his white beard is lengthy and well-kept. 
His attire is simple and his hair long, giving him a feeble and somewhat
pauperly appearance.  Sent by the Var Bandor Scholar Council to evaluate the
shuddeni threat, the events of the Eyeblight War have turned this temporary
venture into a permanent one.  He acts as the representative of Var Bandor
and its interests, ensuring that the trade city have a voice in Kor
Thrandir\@s military ventures.

Vhiona Larine~
Vhiona Larine is here, clad in the armor of an Earendamian general.
~
Vhiona is a strong, stern woman clad in the dress armor of Earendam\@s
High Generals.  Her hair is done up in a short, utilitarian ponytail, and
her eyes are ice-blue.  Despite her auspicious rank, she has a smooth,
almost youthful, face, suggestive of a meteoric rise through the ranks.  The
youngest daughter of the house of Larine, she became Earendam\@s ambassador
to Kor Thrandir before the murder of the Patrician, Danrasad.  Many have
spoken of her frustration at missing the bulk of the War, and the popularity
it afforded to the rival house of Rotheld.

Gahret Mieldoon~
Gahret Mieldoon, prophet of Enirra, contemplates the future.
~
Gahret is an aging man, fatigue showing visibly on his weather-worn
features.  Although his hair is white, he still maintains an impressively
dark beard.  There are no lack of tales about him, and many considered him
in his youth to be a prophet.  Blessed by Enirra, it is his duty to guard
the sacred armor of the Platinum Scales, whose pieces are among the most
famous of that religion\@s relics.  He has come from the Fortress of the Eye
to Kor Thrandir, recognizing the shuddeni presence throughout the Brintors
as a powerful threat to balance.

Rhuidar Neloneus druid elder~
Rhuidar Neloneus~
The elder druid, Rhuidar Neloneus, tends his mountain garden.
~
About five feet tall, Rhuidar Neloneus is a famous ethron druid of the
Brintor Mountains.  He has long, brown hair and a similarly long beard,
framing his pleasant but unremarkable face.  His skin is a pale green, and
shows the weathering of the elevation\@s cold wind.  Born in the mountains,
he earned a notable reputation by foiling the plans of shuddeni slavers. 
His presence was welcomed by Lord Protector Malyn, who hailed him as a hero,
and he has since remained within Kor Thrandir.  He spends much of his time
tending his garden, stirring life amidst the stones.

Lord Protector Malyn~
Malyn, Lord Protector of Kor Thrandir, reads within his chambers.
~
Lord Protector Malyn is the scion of the house of Thrandir, whose
ancestor led the offensive which drove the shuddeni back into their
underworld.  He is pale skinned and fair-haired, his eyes an unnatural,
shining blue.  Although muscular, it is his imperious bearing rather than
his size which makes him intimidating.  It is he who directs life within the
keep, as well as the many military ventures in which it participates.  The
failures of the Eyeblight War tested his legendary resolve, and have driven
him to seek support from the ch\@taren Haven of Ice, Avayn.

An ancient broadsword of burnished iron is here, its blade razor-keen.~
The holy sword \@Shadrist\@ is a legendary relic of the War of Night and
the crown jewel of house Thrandir\@s hierlooms.  It is reputed to be the
weapon wielded by Melanis, the first Lord Protector, during the final
campaign to drive the shuddeni into the underworld.  According to legend,
Melanis defeated Askulithi, the shuddeni High Warlord, with Shadrist,
scattering the enemy troops.  

Shadrist itself is said to have been forged from iron blessed by Nargas, the
High Priest of Jolinn and friend of Melanis.  Although tales have surely
been exaggerated, Nargas is said to have touched the Ahidaya, and
communicated with the soul of Salyra herself.

Upon the sheet is a physical description of a massive stone beast,
accompanied by a crude drawing as well as several measurements.
Your eye is caught by a short passage saying:
 
-Eyes: Sparked by some sort of unholy flame, they appear capable of
seeing through any physical and/or mental subterfuges.  Even using
the assassin\@s art of cloaking, I was not able to make my way past
the being.
 
-Claws: Forged from an unknown organic material, they seem to be
affected by an unknown enchantment.  Sharper than the keenest
razor, they seem able to cut through any material.
 
-Flesh: Carved of some sort of immutable stone, the beast appears
to be completely impervious to all sorts of physical attack.
Although it is true that my magical repertoire is somewhat limited,
I would be forced to say that spells are also useless against this
monstrousity.  Perhaps a scholar that is not limited to scrollwork
can tell me otherwise.
-------
On the back of the sheet, you can see additional notes, obviously
written by a different hand.  Most of it regards the possible types
of enchantments used in the creation of the beast, as well as
arcane lore surrounding golem creation.  One particular paragraph
reads:
 
  Dilalyn, although certainly not the first maker of sentient
sculptures, definitely the one of most reknown.  Little of him
is known, with most of our information stemming from legend and
the occasional architectural find.  The majority of his pieces
have been found by the few brave scholars willing to travel to
the depths of Yithoul.
  Other possible sources of information: Qilaunin, Thethtil\@s
tomb.

a thin pearl breastplate~
A thin pearl breastplate is here, attached to a silver chain shirt.~
This plate is crafted by a modern attempt to duplicate the lost ch\@taren
Art of Availlae.  It is far from perfected, as it cannot create true
ch\@lonin; instead it crafts form from spirit matter, which is similar in
composition to pearl.  Part of it exists within the plane of spirit and it
is from there that the armor is granted both its shape and power.  Its
investigation has been ongoing as ch\@taren have learned more of the human
art of smithing as handed down by Dolgrael the Forgemaster.

thin pearl breastplate silver chain shirt~
This thin chestplate appears to be made of an enormous, single shard of
pearl.  It is mounted with some secure leather straps over a light, silver
chain shirt.  The craftsmanship of the piece is superb, and the plate itself
seems to be heavily reinforced by magic.  When touched, the plate and chain
both carry with them a tingle of spellcraft.  The surface of the plate plays
tricks on the eye, suggestive of a depth greater than what could be
perceived by mortalkind.

a pair of shimmering white gloves~
A pair of shimmering white gloves with a central silver band is here.~
These gloves are a creation of the warrior-magi of the ch\@taren city of
Avayn, known as the Haven of Ice.  It is said that they were developed by
some of Calaera the Ishia\@s warband, to allow even lesser trained ch\@taren
to strike forcefully against their shuddeni foes.  The process has since
been duplicated elsewhere in Avendar, giving their people an additional tool
in the eternal battle against the darkness.

A pair of silvery leggings, covered by hard pearl plates, is here.~
These leggings are crafted in a modern attempt to duplicate the lost
ch\@taren Art of Availlae.  It is far from prfected, as no one on this plane
has been able to duplicate ch\@lonin.  It still attempts to create form from
spirit matter, and the most effective results thus far produce a material
similar in composition to pearl.  As part of it exists within the spirit
plane, it both draws power from there and biases it against the
dark-hearted.  Creating armor such as this is suggestive of a fusional
effort, bringing together the ch\@taren arts and the smithing of Dolgrael the
Forgemaster.

themselves are heavily reinforced with magic.  The chain and plate both
carry an almost electric tingle, no doubt the result of the spellcraft used
to create them.  Each plate glitters when light crosses it, casting dim
rainbows upon its surface.  Soft leather follows the interior of the waist
to increase the wearer\@s comfort.

These armguards are crafted in a modern attempt to duplicate the lost

been able to duplicate the mythic metal, ch\@lonin.  It still attempts to
create form from spirit matter, and the most effective results thus far
produce a material similar in composition to pearl.  It draws power from the
plane of spirit, biasing it toward the servants of light.  The armguard
plating was slow to be perfected, as spellcasters often found the initial
ones too heavy to use properly.  Lightening them was a recent miracle of
modern craftsmanship, as such armor was unavailable, but sorely needed,
during the War of the Eyeblight.

A shield of unreflective black iron lies behind the barrier, mounted upon
one of the platforms.  The metal of the shield is almost unmarked, a
testament to its strength, perhaps.  The dull iron that composes it reflects
little light, almost seeming to darken its surroundings.  During inspection,

was told by Sitheus the very day he inducted me that we dont kill eachother
that we are free to be greedy alone but if we choose to join the house, we
give up that one right.  I am fucking furious and I want all my shit back
and his fucking punished.  This is pathetict.  There is no way I would have
gone to a closed room with him had I ever had a _thought_ that a raider
could attack another.  I want this taken care of and fast.

A large iron gate stands open, allowing passage by the high stone walls
of Kor Thrandir.  A dark blue flag above the gate flaps in the mountain
wind, bearing the Lord Protector\@s iron cross.  The rugged mountain road is
swept clear, rising into paved cobblestone just outside the town walls.  A
series of pikes stand along the outer wall, the grinning, eyeless skulls of
shuddeni stuck upon them.  From here, the great keep of Kor Thrandir is
visible in the distance to the east.  Additional guard posts are just inside
the walls to the north and south.  The Vorinden Road lies to the west.

The Beginning of Kalyius Way~
Inside the gates, a paved cobblestone street leads through the town of
Kor Thrandir.  Known as Kalyius Way, it takes its name from the famed War of
Night general.  The road itself is surprisingly clean, likely due to the
mountain wind catching the dirt and debris from both caravans and the boots
of travelers.  Stone buildings with high, sloped roofs line the street,
their heavy wooden doors keeping out the cool, fickle breeze.  What plants
are visible are mostly squat shrubs that grow stubbornly in the rocky soil. 
The iron gates are to the west, while the cobblestones continue east.

The Tower Grounds~
A wide, hard-packed dirt path circles the keep of Kor Thrandir,
connecting the houses and shops to the training areas, temple, and
infirmary.  The grass grows wild on the outside of the trail, smattered with
tiny white wildflowers.  The looming presence of the keep reaches skyward to
the south, its ancient stones looking dreadfully imposing.  The mountain
wind whips about the tower, sending the grasses into a sudden wave.  The
path continues east and west.

The Tower Grounds~
A wide, hard-packed dirt path circles the keep of Kor Thrandir,
connecting the houses and shops to the training areas, temple, and
infirmary.  The grass grows wild on the outside of the trail, smattered with
tiny white wildflowers.  The looming presence of the keep reaches skyward to
the west, its ancient stones looking dreadfully imposing.  The mountain wind
whips about the tower, sending the grasses into a sudden wave.  The path
continues north and south.

The Southern Path~
Large, wooden barricades line the southern path, ensuring that the
training areas for the Kor Thrandian soldiers and archers remain both
contained and undisturbed.  The sounds of whistling arrows, clashing of
wooden weapons, and grunting of exertion are common but muted.  The path
itself is packed hard from countless generations of soldiers, archers,
swordsmen, and scholars, with only the few stubborn weeds that spring up at
its edges.  In the distance to the south, two large buildings are visible
beyond the barricades.  To the north, the keep of Kor Thrandir dominates the
skyline.

The Southern Path~
The barricades which line the southern path open up here, allowing
entrance to the training grounds of Kor Thrandir.  Grunts of exertion, as
well as the clack of practice weapons and the snap of bowstrings, form a low
din which persists at nearly all hours.  The scents of practice, as well as
those of the trampled grasses and mountain wind, mix alternatingly with the
passing of the breeze.  To the west, young Thrandian soldiers practice their
martial skills, while to the east is the archery range.  The path continues
south into a cobbled courtyard, and north toward the keep.

A Cobbled Courtyard~
The barricade ends abruptly, opening into a large, open courtyard.  The
paths which lead to and from it are hard-packed dirt, while the courtyard
itself has been paved with cobblestones, not unlike the Civilian Square.  At
the center of the courtyard is a stone fountain which flows with clear
water, lacking ostentation but still quite functional.  A variety of shrubs
surround the outer courtyard, some of it formed into adequate topiary art. 
To the west is the School of the Shining Blade, and to the east is the
grand, Republican-styled Nora Memorial Hall.  South of the courtyard is a
memorial statue, while to the north a path leads between the training
fields.

The Gate to the Training Grounds~
An open wooden gate serves as the entrance to the training grounds of Kor
Thrandir.  The shouts of battle and the clash of wooden weapons split the
air, and the heavy scent of sweat drifts by on the mountain wind.  The
heavily-tread path to the east gives way to the wild grasses, which remain
thoroughly trampled by the near-constant passage of soldiers.  There are no
trees within the training ground, making it a thoroughly open expanse
enclosed by heavy wooden barricades.  To the north, the training grounds
begin, while to the east lies the main footpath.

pounded into a slash of hard-packed dirt.  The shouts of battle and
instruction ring out from all directions, although the soldiers who follow
the path either have yet to begin, or already have completed, their daily
routine.  The thick scent of exertion is carried across the path by the
mountain wind, as well as the smell of the wild grass and the town to the

the training grounds wait to the north.

The grass here is longer and significantly less trampled than elsewhere,
some tiny, stubborn wildflowers peeking out amidst it.  The breeze is more
noticable from here, coming down off of the Brintors, and the various sounds
of practice are more muted than below.  To the north and east, the training

which are trampled low by the passage of Kor Thrandir\@s archers.  There are
no trees within the range itself, leaving plenty of open space for target
practice and preparation.  Wooden barricades surround the field, separating
it to keep most of the arrows in.  The wind is light and surprisingly clear,
with the sounds of snapping bows and striking arrows drifting upon it.  The
field begins to the north, while the main path lies to the west.

improved view of the northern and southern fields.  The grass here is longer
and less trodden than elsewhere on the field, springing up through the rocky
soil.  Several stocks of arrows and additional bows lay in a cleared area,
supplying the nearby archers with whatever they might need.  The air here is
especially sweet, rolling down off of the high, looming mountains.  To the
north and south are the archery fields, while a dirt path leads west.

The well-tread path leads to the entrance of Kor Thrandir\@s School of the
Shining Blade, one of the few schools of swordmastery found within the
Brintors.  The school is built in a style common to the mountains, with a
high, sloping roof and secure walls of cut local stone.  Small windows line
the building\@s longer sides, offering a bit of confined sunlight to the
spartan interior.  A few small shrubs are off to the south of the building,
shaped into rudimentary topiary art.  The courtyard lies to the east, while
the school foyer is through the southern door.

and replaced tiles are especially evident within the circles themselves,
betraying the many decades of swordmasters who have come and gone.  Low
wooden benches form a square around each practice circle, allowing a place
for combatants to rest or spectators to watch.  The high ceiling above is
lined with lanterns, which illuminate the school with yellowish light.  The
school continues south and west.

A Small Classroom~
At the rear of the School of the Shining Blade is an area set aside for
instruction in the theory of swordmastery.  A large black chalkboard hangs
from the rear wall, with various diagrams and angles drawn upon it to
explain how various sword techniques work.  A variety of mats sit before the
board, offering a place for students to sit while they study or meditate. 
The light here is a bit brighter, with extra lanterns flanking the
chalkboard.  To the south is the small office of Colonel Eanaar, while the
practice areas of the school lie to the east.

Colonel Eanaar\@s Office~
Colonel Eanaar\@s office is a small and uncluttered affair, with a writing
desk in the rear corner of the room.  Two windows, one on the western and
southern walls, provide the room with natural light during the day, while a
lantern above lights the office at night.  The remaining walls are decorated
with various banners, awards, and ceremonial weapons presented to the
Colonel at various competitons.  The floor is covered by a rich, Harrudim
rug, giving the otherwise spartan school a richer look.  A wooden door leads
north to the school proper.

The Foyer of the School of the Shining Blade~
Just inside the door, the modest foyer opens up.  The stone walls are
left mostly bare aside from mounting brackets, which show a grand variety of
sword shapes.  All replicas, they represent the broad diversity of
Avendarian bladesmanship and the cultural origins which have shaped modern
swordmastery.  Hanging lanterns provide light for the foyer, and by
extension, the school\@s training areas, giving the interior a bright,
yellowish light.  The floor is smooth octagonal tile, shaded a dark grey. 
To the west the school continues, with the northern door leading out.

The Entrance to the Nora Memorial Hall~
The weathered footpath leads to the entrance to one of Avendar\@s most
renowned schools of Spirit magic.  The Nora Memorial Hall, named after the
legendary spiritmaster Valaiar Nora, is a respectable structure of wood and
mountain stone.  It is built in the Earendamian Republican style, giving it
an unusually grand look for the otherwise utilitarian Kor Thrandian
architecture.  Small shrubs line the front of the building for color, with a
single tree shading the south side.  A grand door to the south leads into
the Hall, while the path leads west to the courtyard.

The ground floor of the Nora Memorial Hall has been outfitted to serve as
a training facility for young spirit templars.  The hardwood flooring is
covered with mats and padding, and the walls reinforced with magic.  The
ceiling is mirrored, giving the hall an unusually open feel for an enclosed
space.  Motes of free-floating white light illuminate the room during the
day and night, drifting lazily about.  The scent of the room stings the nose
with the smells of exertion and the saturation of mystical energy.  The hall
continues east and south.

The Circle of the Spirits~
On the north side of the Nora Memorial Hall is a wide circle, its
circumference arrayed with smooth white crystals.  Each marked with a mystic
rune, this location serves as a focusing point for the power of the spirit
plane.  Golden light bathes the area, sounds of the hall\@s practice are
oddly muted; instead, the faint sound of unintelligable whispers coalesce
into a near-constant hum.  It is from here that the school\@s renowned
templar instructor, Deshmin, offers guidance and personal instruction to
students.  To the east, west, and south the hall continues.

The Bottom of a Blue-Lit Stairway~
This small stairway connects the upper and lower levels of the Nora
Memorial Hall.  The steps themselves are fashioned from polished hardwood,
with a runner of blue carpet which follows from top to bottom.  The walls
here are a sterile mix of white and silver, the firefly-like motes of light
bathing the passage in dim blue luminescence.  The presence of magic grows
ever more intense during the ascent, giving the air a nearly electric tinge.
The stairs lead upward, while the lower level of the Hall lies to the south
and west.

This small foyer serves as the reception area for the Nora Memorial Hall.
It is painted in whites and silvers, giving it a bright but sterile motif. 
The hardwood floor is polished to a shine, the old wood looking rich despite
its age.  Hovering near the ceiling are small motes of light which
illuminate the room, utterly free of fastenings or enclosures.  The foyer
has almost no furniture, and the air tingles with the presence of magic.  To
the north, a grand door leads outside toward the courtyard.  To the east,
the Hall continues.

The End of Kalyius Way~
This paved cobblestone street connects the Kor Thrandian gates to the
fortified central tower.  Kalyius Way is surprisingly clean, likely due to
the mountain wind catching the dirt and debris from both caravans and the
boots of travelers.  Stone buildings with high, sloped roofs line the
street, their heavy wooden doors keeping out the cool, fickle breeze.  What
plants are visible are mostly squat shrubs that grow stubbornly in the rocky
soil.  To the east, the cobblestone road ends, giving way to a path of
hard-packed dirt.  The massive tower-keep of Kor Thrandir rises high above.

The oaken walls of the Kor Thrandian weaponry are awash in glinting iron.
Against the back wall, rows of halberds, maces, and axes are fastidiously
lined up in order of ascending height.  A rack of standard issue swords
rests up front, leaning against a heavy black anvil.  From the back, you can
hear the resounding clang of falling hammers, coupled with the incessant
roar of the furnace.  A small counter, for the ordering of new weapons, lies
at the front of the room.  Kalyius Way waits through the door to the south.

wild animal skins, each dedicated to the local hunter who caught the beast. 
Several racks of supplies, including packs, canteens, and rations line the
floor.  A heady mixture of animal musk, dried goods, and canvas hangs in the
still air.  At the rear of the store is a small space for the clerk,
separated from the store\@s goods by a wooden counter.  The cobbles of
Kalyius Way are through the northern doorway.

The Kor Thrandian armory seems to fairly hum with the efficiency expected
of the military.  The continuous sounds of sizzling metal and clanging
hammers fills the air, emanating from a room in the back.  The oaken panel
walls are bedecked with row upon row of identical glistening breastplates,
each one stamped with the iron cross of Kor Thrandir.  At the front of the
room is a small counter, at which repairs and orders for new armor can be
placed.  A wooden door leads south to Kalyius Way.

The tailor\@s shop is a rugged affair, with a bare wooden floor and
largely undecorated stone walls.  Wooden mannequins follow the length of the
room on both sides, clad in coarse fabrics.  They are in a variety of
statures, with some to represent men, women, and children of local races.  A
small dressing area with a mirror is partitioned off by a yellow, flowery
curtain.  In the back of the shop, a wooden counter separates the display
area from where adjustments are made.  A few hanging lanterns provide light
for the shop, while a wooden door leads back to Kalyius Way.

in the middle of it, giving it a more indulgent look than much of the
spartan keep.  A series of wooden benches sit around the fountain, providing
citizens and travelers alike with a place to rest.  The mountain air is
clear and fresh as it blows between the town\@s buildings.  To the north is
the Inn of the Northern Lights, which also serves as the town bar.  Cobbled
roads lead east, south, and west.

Barrels, crates, and bushels are stacked in rows or on top of one another,

has been erected to block passage to the east and repainted in a simple but
pleasant off-white.  The room contains many alien-looking devices and
unusual spiritual foci.  Various crates filled with unfinished chain mail,
leatherworking tools, and other supplies line the back wall.  A number of
standing mannequins show examples of the store\@s wares, their quality
unquestionable even under casual scrutiny.  A pair of small windows provide
a view of the outside, and shine with flickers of spell-light during the
night hours.  Kalyius Way lies through a door to the south.

room\@s center for transactions, while various alchemical devices and musty
tomes are arranged along the back wall.  A small table nearby is overflowing
with scrolls and unfinished parchments, as well as a broken quill or two.  A
diffuse red glow emanates from a glistening sphere on the ceiling.  Kalyius

shopping area offers a few simple racks of traditional herbal medicines,
packed away in jars of hand-blown glass or stored in paper packages.  Behind
the oaken counter, rows upon rows of labeled jars can be seen, containing
dozens of remedies for injury and poison.  A plain wooden door to the north

Stones line the northern path, whose dirt is packed down hard from the

from the mess hall, and the occasional ruckus from the barracks, catch the
ear.  The smell of food wafts by on the mountain breeze, no doubt enticing
the soldiers leaving practice.  An unimpressive stone building to the west
acts as the military infirmary, where injured soldiers can get quick
treatment.  To the north, the path continues toward the barracks and the
mess hall.  The path to the south circles the central tower.

At the end of the northern path, it diverges into two smaller trails, one
leading to the barracks and the other leading to the mess hall.  Both
structures are made of imposing local stone, and only bear the slightest
resemblance to the grand military buildings typical of the Earendam river
valley.  The split in the path is shaded by the unusual presence of large
trees to the north, the mountain breeze filtering through them.  The scents
of mess hall food linger in the air, and the loud sounds of soldiers at rest
form a near-constant din.

The Entrance to the Mess Hall~
The large, northern mess hall serves all of the Kor Thrandian military,
but mostly is intended to feed the soldiers who live within the nearby
barracks.  The building is made of mountain stone, the interior walls
paneled with stained wood that matches the tile floor.  Long wooden tables

air is heavy with the smell of food, and often a whiff of something burnt or
spilled.  Lanterns and windows provide light for the mess hall, which

The Mess Hall~
The mess hall has long wooden tables arranged in neat columns, providing
space for tired and hungry soldiers to eat.  The wood paneling shows more
than a bit of wear, and the tile floor has the tell-tale spots of years-old
spills.  Lanterns hang from the ceiling, complementing the building\@s small
windows to light it at all hours.  The air is thick with the scent of food,
old and new, and often carrying with it a burnt tinge.  To the north and
west, the mess hall continues.

A White Infirmary~
The military infirmary is a single, spacious room filled with a series of
bunk beds.  The stone walls are paneled with wood and painted a calming
white, with various icons of the iron cross hung as decorations.  Along the
south wall, a counter provides a workspace for the attending scholar, and a
rack of shelves provides fresh bandages, salves, and other supplies.  The
air is sterile, tinged with the sharp scent of herbal medicine.  Three
hanging white globes provide ample light for the infirmary.  The eastern
door leads outside, to a hard-packed dirt path.

The Eyeblight War Memorial~
South of the courtyard is a small open expanse, whose wild grasses are
kept far shorter than elsewhere about the keep.  The air here is clear, and
a breeze travels through it from across the mountains.  A large statue is
here commemorating the end of the War of the Eyeblight, which looms tall
behind the modest cobbled square.  Small shrubs surround three sides of the
statue, leaving one side clear for an engraved iron plaque.  A faint dirt
path leads back north to the courtyard.

large statue memorial war eyeblight~
A tall golden seraph stands upon a marble base, the surface polished to
an eye-searing shine.  The figure is exceedingly slender with accented
proportions; the shoulders and wings are especially broad, and the limbs
especially long.  Its face is delicate and androgynous, one of its golden
hands raising a torch.  White light ripples from it, akin to a flame,
bathing the area in an unnatural glow.  An iron plaque is mounted upon the
marble base.

The engraved iron plaque reads:

\#In memory of all who guided the Surface Alliance

Beneath the engraving, a silver teardrop emblem is affixed to the plate.

The Entrance to the Barracks~
The Kor Thrandian barracks provide shelter for the many foreign soldiers
who have come to combat the shuddeni but have not yet laid down permanent
roots.  The building is respectably large, with a number of bunk beds
erected to increase sleeping capacity and metal lockers for clothes and
personal items.  The high ceiling bears a number of hanging lanterns to
provide light, and small windows to assist during the daylight hours.  The
scents of soldiers hang in the air, with little to clear it out.  The solid
wooden door to the barracks is west, while it continues north, east, and

paneled in wood.  Two lanterns hang from the ceiling to provide light, and
the near endless racket of the barracks proper is at least a little muted. 
Two shields hang from each wall, both bearing the iron cross of Kor
Thrandir, and serve as the only real decoration.  At the east end of the
hall is a wooden door, while to the west is the main floor.

are placed throughout, providing space for card games, dice games, or
general congregation.  Some of the largest windows in the barracks are in
this room, on the east and south walls, giving a sweeping view of the tower
grounds and the temple.  All of the furniture here seems well-used and

As you inspect the Logorin Star, your sense of reality blurs and the hall
warps around you..  

When your sight returns you stand at the lip of a great pit hewn into foul
black earth.  Beyond it the walls and spires of some infernal city rise into
the unwholesome skies.  Your gaze is drawn downwards into the depths of the
chasm.  Within, hundreds upon thousands of chittering and clattering horrors
writhe in a sea of chitin and spines.  Horrible insectoid abberations and
spined crocodiles climb over one another as screaming figures are tossed
into the pit, fighting to messily devour the offerings.  

As you gaze at this scene of horror you feel a sudden pressure as you are
pitched over the cliff yourself.  Falling helplessly you can only scream as
you watch the glistening spines and rending mandibles draw closer, waiting
to envelop you in a sea of pain.  

You suddenly jerk back to your senses, the Logorin Star searing itself into
your mind.

throughout the floor.  Set into the nearby pillar is an oil painting of
General Lystaran, one of Earendam\@s greatest tacticians.  A golden plaque

General Lystaran led the Earendamian fighting company known as the
Company of the Golden Hand, from whom the grand vanguard of the Republic
would take its name.  At the War\@s outset, he led a band of warriors from
Earendam to the swamps of Sythtys, where he routed the forces of Sethyltheus
the Elder.  This victory elevated him to commander of the Republic\@s templar
contingent, and his forces often battled the shuddeni to a draw instead of
defeat.  He fell in one of the War\@s final battles.

A fierce and heavily armored man is posed within a dark and blood-painted

Golden Hand, and in his hand he hefts a classical Earendamian longsword. 
His other hand remains open, a burst of ice leaping from it; his sapphire
shield is slung over one shoulder.  The object of the man\@s wrath is an
enormous srryn nearly twice his size.  It appears frozen mid-motion,
swinging a spiked mace downward.

With them, Envarinon is said to have held off an entire squadron of chaja
spearmen.  Many considered him to be an unstoppable force of nature, until
he succumbed to his wounds after the defeat of Ijjkani and Akkyara.

Envarinon of house Vahendra is widely considered the greatest swordmaster
in Avendar\@s history, whose reputation was legendary even within his own
lifetime.  A wanderer, histories suggest that he followed alongside the Army
of the Golden Hand without ever formally enlisting in its ranks.  The very
sight of Envarinon and his twin blades is said to have caused his opponents
to drop their weapons and flee.  At the Trap of Valandas, he slew Ijjkani
and Akkyara, two of the shuddeni\@s most feared assassins, only to succumb to
his wounds after the battle\@s end.

another shuddeni\@s attack.  Both are clad in the rich silks of shuddeni
assassins, bearing black knives.  Although he appears wounded, the aelin
swordsman appears utterly calm, the battle apparently effortless.  Both
assassins are soaked in blood, and limp or buckle from their wounds.

Kalyius Urhban was the high general of the Army of Golden Hand, and among

powerful demon summoned by the shuddeni high warlord, Askulithi.  Kalyius\@
only defeat was at the infamous Trap of Valandas, a daring strike into
shuddeni forces gone awry.  In spite of this, he survived to return to
Earendam to defend the city shortly after.

Tyril, Saviour of Earendam, is among its most celebrated and
controversial heroes.  He is most famous for foiling the plot of the
archmage Kaagn, who planned to deliver the heart of the Republic to the
shuddeni forces during the War of Night.  Stories say he pilfered the
spellbook of the archmage, as well as his plans, and aided in the defense of
the city during the shuddeni attack.  Despite these many deeds, he remains
divisive, having profited immensely during the after-War chaos.

spellbook.  Clothed in black leather, he lingers in the shadow of the wall.

Standing over ten feet tall, it depicts an enormous human warrior plunging a

The Gallery of Heroes~
The ceiling for the base floor of the tower extends nearly twenty feet
into the air, supported by dark stone columns.  Orbs of smokeless orange
light, high above, are mounted upon the pillars, casting their light
throughout the floor.  Set into the nearby pillar is an oil painting of
Saint Chalane Tyra, leader of the ch\@taren.  A golden plaque beneath
describes his role during the War of Night.  The tile floor is well-swept,
and the air is still with reverence.  The Gallery of Heroes continues to the
east, with a large monument directly west.

oil painting saint chalane tyra ch\@taren~
A broad-shouldered ch\@taren is portrayed in motion, white fire blazing
from his open hand.  His eyes are without pupils and pure silver, and a
golden halo hovers above his long, shimmering hair.  Seraphic wings stretch
from his back, and his golden skin starkly contrasts the darkness around
him.  Shuddeni surround him, but he remains dominant; they seem fragile,
mouths frozen in screams of horror, while he hovers mightily above.  Light
streams from him, radiating outward as if he were the sun.  
~
E
golden plaque~
Chalane Tyra was one of the most famous ch\@taren of the War of Night, and
is venerated as a Saint by the Champions of Avendar.  He was the son of
Curalin Tyra, the leader of the ch\@taren during their transition from their
home plane to the Prime Material.  Curalin and many of his peers were cut
down by shuddeni archmages during the Day of Two Dawns, leaving the young
race with little martial direction.  Chalane assumed this role, with the
legendary heroine Calaera as his trusted lieutenant.

oil painting ilciryas ethron ranger-king qilarn~
At first glance, this painting depicts only the eaves of a great forest. 
Upon closer inspection, the trees and undergrowth are teeming with peering
eyes.  At their center is a shadowy, forest-green ethron whose face is
painted for battle.  His leather clothing blends in almost seamlessly with
nature, and his hands bear a black longbow adorned with raven feathers.  The
bow is nocked with a barbed arrow, whose white plume is spectacular and
striking in contrast to the dark surroundings.  
~
E
golden plaque~
Ilciryas was the cunning ranger-king of the ethron during the War of
Night.  The head of the Eqiril clan, he presided over the forest of Qilarn
and its many inhabitants.  Ethron trackers informed him of the advances of
the shuddeni legions, and he rallied numerous ethron clans into a great
host.  When the shuddeni entered the forest, they were immediately under
siege by arrows, animate plants, ambushes, and fierce animals.  Their forces
halved within a week, the shuddeni survivors fled the forest, never to
return.

Having come from their devastated home plane, many no longer function

Iliraya of house Sadonna was a famous priestess of the aelin god, Aeolis,
and a renowned healer.  She is said to have accompanied the Army of the
Golden Hand, despite being an Ilodaiyan native and not a part of the
Republic.  She traveled all over the continent with them, and served as an
inspiration to the warriors; a symbol of the purity they fought to defend. 
During General Kalyius\@ legendary battle with the demon Ur-Thazal, she waded
into the battle to ward him from harm.

her, angelic, providing shade to the wounded soldier she tends.  Her hands
are placed upon his bleeding chest, shining with pale blue light.  Her long
hair is tousled and flecked with dirt and her cheek is marred with grime,
but her eyes and expression convey great compassion.

and stone painted with blood.  A mass of dark brown fur, his befanged jaws
are open in a frozen roar.  He is clad in the stone talismans, sewn leather,
and bone fetishes of his pack, the mauled body of a chaja beneath his clawed

Rakinal, legendary kankoran warrior and leader of the Ryarl pack, is
named among the heroes of the War of Night.  Having caught wind of the
shuddeni plans through the pack\@s scouts, he gathered his warriors and
prepared to defend their icy home.  During the Trap of Valandas, he and his
pack blindsided the shuddeni forces with a spectacular ambush.  Military
historians assert that this sudden appearance is the only reason the Army of
the Golden hand was able to escape that day.

The walls are made of heavy grey stone, much like the tower\@s exterior,
giving it a colder feel than the warmth of the air would suggest.  The floor
is set with tiles, and mounted globes of light provide steady, constant
illumination.  There are no windows in this portion of the tower, with
banners bearing the iron cross taking their place.  The hallway continues to
the north and south.

The Spiral Stairway~
A narrow stairway provides access to the higher and lower levels of the
tower of Kor Thrandir.  The steps are made of dark stone, weathered by
untold generations of feet, and a thin iron railing provides a handhold for
the unsteady.  This portion of the stairwell is more richly adorned than
those of the lower levels, the railing plated with silver and etched with
cross-patterns.  The light from the eastern hallway filters onto the stairs,
and the air is fresh, cool, and well-ventilated.  To the east, a gilded
hallway leads through the suites of Kor Thrandir\@s most esteemed
ambassadors.  The stairs descend to the floor below.

A gilded hallway leads through this floor of the tower, connecting the
keep\@s richest suites.  The hall is immaculate, and the stone walls are
decorated with lightly-colored papering and golden adornments.  The stone
tiles are covered by a lush red carpet, with potted, standing plants spaced
every few feet.  Hanging globes of light illuminate the hall, the mountings

This small alcove off of the gilded hallway is far less rich-looking,
returning to the dark stone fittings of the lower levels of the tower.  A
set of wide stairs lead upward to a large hatch, which provides access to
the roof of the keep.  A few stores of bows and arrows sit against the
alcove walls, with a pair of mounted lights above them.  The cold mountain
wind whistles across the hatch, some of it whipping down through the chamber
itself.  A heavy iron door obstructs the wind, leading west into the gilded
hallway.

A Barbarous Suite~
This suite is of reasonable size, but seems much smaller due to the
myriad of trophies and fetishes which decorate it.  The floor is covered by
a rugged bear skin, complete with roaring mouth.  Animal heads, tokens of
war, and carved bones follow the length of the walls, and the air hangs
heavy with animal and metallic scents.  A few weapons are mounted throughout
the room, each seized from some fallen foe.  The room\@s only major pieces of
furniture are a small bed and a table with a single chair.  A hanging
lantern lights the room, giving it the eerie cast of some barbarous camp.  A
door leads north into the hallway.

the tile floor, free of stain and wear.  A luxurious bed, easily large
enough for three people, rests in the corner of the room, sporting a darker
green canopy.  A tall wardrobe is across the room, with a beautiful rosewood
desk and matching chair beside it.  The room is dim, the low light provided
by shaded globes.  The air is sweet and intoxicating with the scents of
exotic spices.  An elaborately carved door leads south into the hallway.

disorganized array of texts, papers, and folders, they suggest a degree of
research and study which is unusual for the martial bent of the keep.  A
neatly made bed is against the north wall, looking rarely used; conversely,
the desk against the south wall is covered with books, ledgers, and other
papers, many of them open.  The green rug is only partially visible given
the room\@s clutter, even with the thorough lighting from above.  A door
leads west to the hallway.

An Ambassador\@s Suite~
Set aside for the ambassador of Earendam, this suite mirrors the marble
and gold of the Republican style.  A plush blue rug warms the marble floor,
with tassels at the far edges, and the corners of the chamber are decorated
with Glallian sculptures.  On the eastern wall is an impressive-looking bed,
its frame made from oak and its blankets a particularly rich navy blue.  A
matching desk is on the south wall, while a wardrobe and dresser are against
the north.  An orb of light is suspended from the ceiling, lighting the
room.  An elaborately carved door opens west into the hallway.

An Ambassador\@s Suite~
This suite is surprisingly utilitarian given the impressive reputation of
its occupant.  Unlike much of the tower, it is lit by an array of wax
candles, arranged in three separate arcs, as well as set into iron wall
mountings.  In the rear of the room is a simple bed, covered with a dark
wool blanket and a grey down comforter.  The desk beside it is part of a
matched set to the bed, and the entire room is bathed in the orange glow of
candlelight.  The air is close and smells faintly of smoke, from both the
candles and tobacco.  A sturdy wooden door is set into the north wall,
leading out.

A Densely Populated Garden~
The garden around you seems vastly different from the plain grasslands
surrounding the keep.  Large trees have sprouted up in an even circle,
completely surrounding the plants inside.  Various plants and bushes rise
from the ground, making it difficult to find a place to stand.  Two thick
trees are in the center of the garden, a woven hammock strung between them. 
A fallen log has had its top smoothed over, making it seem like a suitable
bench.  To the south, a hard-packed path leads through the north side of Kor
Thrandir.

Just south of the hallway, a simply furnished room serves as an anteroom
to the Lord Protector\@s personal chambers.  Two couches face one another,
providing a place for guests to impart their petitions directly to Malyn
himself.  A central coffee table is decorated with a vase of flowers,
providing the majority of the anteroom\@s color.  Upon the walls hang
portraits of some of the line of Thrandir, some of them quite ancient.  An
open passage to the east leads into the Lord Protector\@s quarters, while a
door engraved with the iron cross leads out into the hall.

The Lord Protector\@s Chambers~
This large chamber is furnished richly, with lavish blue carpeting and
two notably large paintings.  Against the northeast corner of the room is a
wide bed, covered by a thick, expensive blanket.  A standing rack beside a
tall wardrobe looks suited to hold the burnished iron armor of house
Thrandir, while the wardrobe itself is for other, more mundane clothing.  A
well-appointed desk and chair provide a place for reading and writing, a
quill and rolls of parchment at the ready.  The center of the room\@s floor
is open and spacious, with the great cross of Kor Thrandir marked in silver
on the carpet.  An open passage leads west into the anteroom.

The Tower Battlements~
The top of the tower of Kor Thrandir is fortified with partial walls,
with numerous locations for battlement archers to target the ground below. 
The high wind is cold and intermittant, blowing across the top of the keep. 
From here, the Brintors loom in the distance, and the grasslands spread out
across the rocky soil.  The sloped roofs of Kor Thrandian buildings dot the
landscape, and its protective walls are visible in the distance.  The stone
tiles underfoot are swept clean, providing better footing for the archers. 
The battlements continue east and south.

The Tower Battlements~
The top of the tower of Kor Thrandir is fortified with partial walls,
with numerous locations for battlement archers to target the ground below. 
The high wind is cold and intermittant, blowing across the top of the keep. 
From here, the Brintors loom in the distance, and the grasslands spread out
across the rocky soil.  The sloped roofs of Kor Thrandian buildings dot the
landscape, and its protective walls are visible in the distance.  The stone
tiles underfoot are swept clean, providing better footing for the archers. 
The battlements continue north, east, and south.

On Top of the Tower~
At the center of the high tower\@s roof, the high wind is less punishing
and its roar is less overwhelming.  From here, the battlements guard the
area from all directions, and the Brintor mountains rise in the distance. 
The stone tiles in this area form the icon of the iron cross, large enough
to cover much of the rooftop.  The air is fresh and open, and there is
little protection here from the elements.  To the north, east, south, and
west, the tower top continues.

The Antechamber to the Chamber of the Seal~
The stairwell which follows the height of the tower descends into a
cavernous basement.  Its stone steps and iron railing come to an end at the
stone tiles of the underground, the stone of the walls rougher than those
above.  The scent of the earth is thicker here, and a magic charge is
carried through the dank air.  There are no lights in the basement; instead,
the entirety of the chamber is lit by the immense light given off by the
Great Seal, which rests at its center.  A path to the east and west goes
around it, circling the chamber.

A Dank, Cavernous Room~
The basement of the high tower is reinforced with heavy stone, the floor
tiled in stone.  The air is damp and clammy even during the summer, and
magic courses through the air with an electric tinge.  There are no mounted
lights within the chamber; instead, the immense wards of the chamber\@s
central seal emit a powerful and constant glow.  The ceiling is about ten
feet high, and the rough-hewn stones are unadorned.  To the east, the
cavernous chamber continues, while a stairwell west leads upward.  To the
south, the unnatural light of the Great Seal grows stronger.

The Mystic Seal is etched with immense and powerful runes, glowing golden

tremendous spread of shimmering metals.  The seal itself is raised above
floor level, and emits a low and constant hum.  The air is heavy with
enchantment, making it difficult to catch a full breath.  There are no
lanterns or lights here, the entire space illuminated by the shine of the
seal\@s wards.  To the east and south, the surface of the seal continues.

The Tower Grounds~
A wide, hard-packed dirt path circles the keep of Kor Thrandir,
connecting the houses and shops to the training areas, temple, and
infirmary.  The grass grows wild on the outside of the trail, smattered with
tiny white wildflowers.  The looming presence of the keep reaches skyward to
the south, its ancient stones looking dreadfully imposing.  The mountain
wind whips about the tower, sending the grasses into a sudden wave.  The
path continues east and west.

The Mess Hall Kitchen~
The mess hall kitchen serves the food for most of the Kor Thrandian
soldiers.  A long counter with wooden trays provides a place for the day or
evening meal to be set out, with large kettles, pots, and serving utensils,
past which the troops walk in single file.  Behind it, a number of counters
provide a place for more elaborate meals to be prepared, as well as a large
hearth for cooking.  Mops and other cleaning items are placed in the back
corner of the room, while lanterns overhead provide light.  The mess hall\@s
many tables wait to the north.

The mess hall has long wooden tables arranged in neat columns, providing
space for tired and hungry soldiers to eat.  The wood paneling shows more
than a bit of wear, and the tile floor has the tell-tale spots of years-old
spills.  Lanterns hang from the ceiling, complementing the building\@s small
windows to light it at all hours.  The air is thick with the scent of food,
old and new, and often carrying with it a burnt tinge.  To the east and
south, the mess hall continues.

The Inn of the Northern Lights~
The Inn of the Northern Lights is where travelers to Kor Thrandir are
granted a place to rest and recuperate from their long treks.  It is warm
but utilitarian, with a high ceiling and many small tables.  The Inn
provides a gathering point for both citizens and off-duty soldiers, giving
them some much-needed relaxation.  A bar stands near the west wall,
reasonably supplied with drinks and menus.  A few simple icons of the Kor
Thrandian iron cross offer simple, bland decoration to the room\@s interior. 
A hallway to the north leads to the Inn\@s few guest rooms, while Alliance
Square lies through a door to the south.

Behind the common room of the Inn of the Northern Lights, a narrow
hallway connects it to the rooms available for guests who spend the night. 
The wood-paneled walls are hung with simple, soothing art, depicting forests
and lakes.  The wooden floor is covered by a thick, weathered rug, which has
seen the traffic of many years.  Simple ceiling mountings contain globes of
light, keeping the hall well-lit even at night.  The hallway continues to
the east, while a wooden door leads to a room to the north.

This cramped room is lit by a single lantern, and contains a modest bed,
dresser, and tiny desk.  The furniture is rough-looking enough to suggest it
was made here rather than imported, and all of it shows the wear of
countless years.  The bed itself contains a number of heavy, colorful
quilts, offsetting the bland grey rug.  The walls are paneled with wood and
painted a drab off-white, with their only substantive decoration being an
iron cross icon.  The door to the south leads into the adjoining hallway.

In the back of the barracks, a small room has been set aside for the
overseeing officer.  It is more lavishly furnished than the various bunk
beds and metal lockers of the barracks proper, in that it has a reasonably
plush bed, a dresser and nightstand, and a personal closet.  The walls are
decorated with various swords and shields, no doubt trophies hard-won by
Major Chartoff, the longstanding officer of the barracks.  A few scented
candles are placed throughout the room in metal holders.  To the west, a
wooden door leads into an adjoining hall.

A Small Tunnel~
Beneath the trap door, a tunnel descends into the rocky soil.  The walls
are packed hard and reinforced with aged wooden supports, while a ladder
leads downward to the earthen floor.  The ceiling is low, and the light
which filters down into the tunnel does so from the room above.  The scent
of wood and earth hangs in the dim, still air.  The walls and floor are
smooth from years of passage, with most of the loose rock and dirt removed. 
The tunnel continues to the west, while the inn room is through the upper
door.

A Hidden Lair~
At the end of the tunnel is a surprisingly large chamber, carved out of
the hard soil of the Brintors.  Thick insulation has been worked in between
the support beams, and both are covered by heavy, hanging velvet curtains. 
A metal lantern hangs from the ceiling from a chain, its pale flame offering
the room\@s only light.  The lair is furnished simply, with a low bed against
the west wall and a small table and two chairs not far from it.  Various
regional maps of the mountains and the town sit upon the table, apparently
used for some manner of planning.  The tunnel provides the only exit, to the
east.

Iliraya Avenue~
This paved cobblestone street leads through the residential section of
Kor Thrandir, where many of its families live.  It is named in honor of
Iliraya, the renowned War of Night healer.  The avenue itself is quite wide,
allowing the passage of pack animals or space for children to play.  The
cobbles underfoot are a bit uneven, with tenacious mountain grass springing
up between them.  Stone houses with sloped roofs line the street, with tight
alleys leading between them to more homes.  The mountain wind sweeps along
the street, whistling as it passes.

This small home is modestly furnished, lit by oil lamps and candles. 
Much of the furniture is wicker or unfinished wood, and the walls are made
of the stone common to Kor Thrandir.  Small glass windows, one on each wall,
let in light during the daytime, the view outside distorted by the blowing
process.  Simple curtains provide a measure of privacy, and the floor is
covered by a heavy wool rug.  A small hearth provides heat for the home, as
well as a cooking space.  A wooden stairwell leads up to a tiny attic, while
a door to the west leads out of the house.

A Simple Attic~
A tiny attic is built above the main floor of this modest Kor Thrandian
home.  Old, handmade rugs cover the wooden floor, with a low cot off to one
side for someone to sleep.  The thatched roof is close overhead, enough to
hear the whistle of the wind or the sound of rain.  Two small oil lamps
provide the only light for the room, and a few boxes are pushed against the
walls for storage.  Warmth rises up from the hearth on the level below,
offset by the thinness of the roof.  A wooden stairwell leads down to the
home proper.

The Eastern Path~
The path to the temple of Kor Thrandir begins as hard packed dirt, before
stepping up onto carefully-laid grey cobblestones.  Squat shrubs line the
narrow road, covered with small green leaves.  The temple itself is a
building of heavy grey stone with a wide base and an open bell tower.  An
iron cross adorns the peak of the tower, covered by a clinging rust.  The
great keep of Kor Thrandir rises imperiously to the west, substantially
taller than the eastern temple.  The air is clear and fresh, drifting down
from the Brintors.  The cobbles continue east, with a dirt path to the west.

The Eastern Path~
Grey cobblestones mark the path underfoot which leads to the temple of
Kor Thrandir.  Squat shrubs line the narrow road, covered with small green
leaves.  From here, the temple seems quite large, with a wide base and a
high, open bell tower.  An iron cross adorns its peak, covered by a clinging
rust.  The great keep of Kor Thrandir rises imperiously to the west,
substantially taller than the temple to the north.  The air is clear and
fresh, drifting down from the Brintors.  The wide stone steps lead north
into the temple, while the cobbled path leads west.

The Entrance to the Temple of Kor Thrandir~
A series of stone steps lead up to the entrance to the temple of Kor
Thrandir.  Cut from local stone, the temple is among the oldest buildings
within the town and frequented by almost all of its citizens.  The entrance
is arched, with two huge wooden doors that stand open; tall, thin windows
allow natural light to stream into the temple interior.  The bell tower high
above is open, so when it rings, everyone within Kor Thrandir can hear it. 
Small shrubs line the edge of the temple and its rising stairs.  To the
south, a cobbled path leads back toward the keep.

Before the Sapphire Altar~
The interior of the temple of Kor Thrandir is a high, buttressed affair,
cut from dark stone.  Unlike much of the town, the interior is carpeted in a
deep, lush blue.  A small arrangement of pews provide places for the keep\@s
citizens and visitors to pray, made from wood imported from Earendam. 
Silver mountings hold globes of pure white light, and the walls are adorned
with silk banners bearing the Diamond Shield and the iron cross.  The altar
rests upon a low dais, in the approximate center of the room.  To the north,
east, and west are shrines to other commonly venerated deities of Kor
Thrandir.  High above is the platform for the bell-ringer, while the
temple\@s exit is to the south.

A Shrine to Calaera~
On the western side of the temple of Kor Thrandir is a small shrine to
Calaera the Ishia.  Swords and shields, scarred from battle, are arranged
about a central seraph icon, which glitters in polished gold.  A few thick,
rich mats of white sit before it, allowing the temple\@s devoted to kneel and
pray.  High glass windows rise above the icon, allowing the evening sun to
shine through them and bathe the display in orange light.  The grim stone of
the temple is offset by a lush blue carpet and played upon by free-floating
motes of light.  The temple\@s central altar lies to the east.

A polished gold seraph acts as the shrine\@s centerpiece, surrounded by
battered swords and shields.  It is about four feet tall, with one arm
raising a glass-bladed sword.  The figure is female and modestly designed,
with four glass wings rising from its back.  When the evening sun is in just
the right position, the wings and sword catch the light in a searing flash,
while the gold\@s surface flashes a rich orange.

A Shrine to Vaialos~
On the eastern side of the temple of Kor Thrandir is a small shrine to
the Martyr-God, Vaialos.  A variety of fresh flowers are placed around a
standing teardrop icon, its surface coated in mirror-polished silver.  A few
thick, rich mats of white sit before it, allowing the temple\@s devoted to
kneel and pray.  High glass windows rise above the icon, allowing the
morning sun to shine through them to light the display from behind.  The
grim stone of the temple is offset by a lush blue carpet and played upon by

ch\@taren worshippers.  The teardrop itself is about three feet tall, with
etchings of ancient ch\@taren runes all over its surface.  The markings are

A Shrine to Dolgrael~
On the northern side of the temple of Kor Thrandir is a small shrine to
Dolgrael the Forgemaster.  A bowl containing an eternal flame burns at the
base of an icon made of cast iron, shaped to resemble a warrior with a great
hammer.  Its eyes are chips of ruby, and a few thick, black mats sit before
it, allowing the temple\@s devoted to kneel and pray.  High glass windows
rise above the icon, the daylight or darkness constantly framing the
shoulders of the frozen figure.  The grim stone of the temple is offset by a
lush blue carpet and played upon by free-floating motes of light.  The
temple\@s central altar lies to the south.

head against the floor.  Its face is stern and fierce, with chips of ruby
inset as eyes.  A black bowl rests before the statue, the flame inside it
burning forever, filling the area with flickering shadows.

The Bell Tower~
High above the altar of Jolinn is a wooden platform which provides a
place for someone to stand if ringing the great temple bell.  The bell
itself is massive and forged from thick iron, and is engraved with the name
of its creator, as well as the iron cross of house Thrandir.  The bell tower
itself has large open windows, with only a semi-permeable field of energy to
keep out the elements.  The wind blows through the room and around the bell,
giving it a near-permanent chill.  A long rope provides the mechanism to
ring the great bell when necessary.  An open space in the platform allows a
descent into the temple proper.

The Top of a Blue-Lit Stairway~
This small stairway connects the upper and lower levels of the Nora
Memorial Hall.  The steps themselves are fashioned from polished hardwood,
with a runner of blue carpet which follows from top to bottom.  The walls
here are a sterile mix of white and silver, the firefly-like motes of light
bathing the passage in dim blue luminescence.  The presence of magic grows
ever more intense during the ascent, giving the air a nearly electric tinge.
The stairs lead downward, while the upper level of the Hall lies to the
south and west.

cushion from which the Archmage can direct her class, with more mundane mats
arranged around it in a half-circle for students.  A small memorial is
