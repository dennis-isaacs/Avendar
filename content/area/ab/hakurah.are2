a masked human monk~
A sturdy, masked monk stoically guards the gatehouse.
~
A sturdy human monk keeps careful watch on the only entrance into the
Hakurah monastery.  His eyes are both perceptive and discerning, looking for
signs of trouble on the faces of new arrivals.  His skin is dark and
weathered from the ravine\@s chill wind, his face masked to protect his face
and preserve warmth.  He looks healthy despite the hardship of his post, his
posture one of stoic dispassion.

An off-duty monk rests upon a bedroll, meditating.

A well-muscled human monk is here, resting between shifts on watch in the
guardhouse below.  His face is unmasked and rough with stubble, and his skin
dark from many long days and nights in the service of the monastery.  His
expression is weary but centered, and he sits upon a bedroll in quiet
thought.  He glances toward the doors and windows when a sudden gust of wind
causes them to rattle.

This aelin monk of the Hakuran order keeps a stoic watch from the
monastery\@s battlements.  Bow in hand, he remains vigilant of the plains to
the east, ready to defend the shrine in an emergency.  His skin is tough
from the bite of the cold Ryarl wind, and his frame lined with cords of
muscle.  He wears a wrapped mask to shield his face from some of the
elements, his wings ruffled from exposure.

Slowly working a broom, a monk sweeps the flagstones.

This monk tends to his duties, sweeping it clean of the dust and debris
stirred up by the northern winds.  His head is recently shaved, with dark
stubble covering his scalp.  He wears heavy robes to ward off the Ryarl
chill and his skin is weathered from being outdoors in the unforgiving
clime.  He goes about his job with a meditative serenity, humming quietly to
himself as he works.

Iskasal~
Iskasal sits on a small purple cushion, practicing calligraphy at a low table.
~
A tall, lanky caladaran, Iskasal acts as both the head of the Hakurah
temple and head instructor of its psionicists.  It is said that he was the
first to discover the recipe for the temple\@s famed liqueur and personally
oversaw the construction of the distillery.  His actual age is a mystery
even amongst the Hakuran order; some suspect that his thorough mastery of
mind and body have given him unusual longevity even for his kind.  He is
distant but kind, training all who seek to unlock their own latent
potential.

Ialjimar~
A youthful caladaran monk tends the counter.
~
Ialjimar is a well-regarded disciple of the Hakuran order.  A relatively
youthful caladaran, his barky body shows the rigor of monastery life but not
the encroachment of years.  His demeanor is pleasant, moreso than one might
expect of a monk, and he handles the sale of the Hakurah temple\@s famous
alcohol.  It is well known that he was hand-picked by Iskasal for the honor
of dispensing the shrine\@s spirits, which makes his position all the more
enviable.  He keeps watch over the shop for most of the day, meditating when
there are no customers.

Ijjaka~
A thick-bodied shuddeni sits silently upon a meditation mat.
~
Ijjaka, a middle-aged shuddeni, meditates on one of the woven reed mats. 
Once a backstabbing merchant of the Shutharka clan, he abandoned that
profession after the threats upon his life became too numerous to ignore. 
One of the vows that allows him to stay within the monastery was that he
would give up merchantry forever.  Despite a harder life, his body still
bears the pudginess of his youthful lifestyle.  His wrinkled, grey skin is
modestly oiled to match his simple attire.

A woman with a dark ponytail carefully tends to the nearby flora.

A handsome woman with a utilitarian ponytail, Maicine Prara traveled to
the monastery in search of enlightenment.  Her troubled past and angry
outbursts made her an outsider amongst the Hakuran monks until Ral Kordarran
assumed leadership of the assassin guild.  In the time since, she has
developed her previously undiscovered druidic talent with impressive
dedication.  She serves the guild by growing poisonous plants and extracting
their venom for refinement.

A veteran of Earendam\@s Army of the Republic, Hurgas has retired to the
monastery in wake of the War of the Eyeblight.  Like many of his comrades,
the close of the struggle left him with more questions than answers.  He
bears a long scar on his back from the knife of a shuddeni Hateblade, which
he obtained defending his commanding officer, Cidone Rotheld.  Although
granted many honors for valor, he spends his days living simply with the
monks of the Hakuran order in search of inner peace.

Ral Kordarran~
A large, dark-furred kankoran sits cross-legged as he meditates.
~
A wanderer from the far-flung Crimson Sands, Ral Kordarran is an oddity
within the Hakurah Monastery.  Although kankoran, he shares little with the
Girikhan pack of the Ryarl.  His long years of travel made him a formidable
combatant, but he did not unlock his deeper potential in the ways of
assassinry until his arrival at the shrine.  Since then, he has been
accepted by the monks of the monastery, and he now serves as head of its
assassin guild.  Like many kankoran of his distant tribe, his chest has been
ritually shaved of its dark fur; upon it is marked a prominent circle of
black fangs.

Alian Ashana blonde aelin man dark wings swordmaster~
Alian~
A blonde aelin man with dark wings meditates within the temple.
~
A tall and broad-shouldered aelin, Alian of house Ashana meditates within
the Hakurah shrine.  He is of middling age, his features carrying with them
the distinguished bearing of experience.  His hair is a mess of silver and
blonde strands, which sharply contrast his black-feathered wings.  Having
trained within the Thrantian School of Earendam, he is both educated and a
skilled swordsman.  He has made the long journey across the Brintors in
search of enlightenment, which he feels will take his bladesmanship to a new
degree of mastery.  His dark eyes smolder with intensity as he looks up
toward the crystal window, chin raised.

A female aelin monk gazes meaningfully at the guild\@s dagger collection.
~
A young aelin monk gazes with interest at the Hakurah shrine\@s vast
dagger collection.  She looks with extra interest at the dark steel blades
of Ashta Harrud, her smooth brow furrowed in consideration.  She wears her
white hair short, rather than shaving her head like many monks.  She chews
on her lip now and then.

an ethron ascetic~
A female ethron ascetic holds a cup of liqueur, breathing deeply of its scent.
~
This young ethron woman sits near the decanter on a meditation mat,
cradling a cup in her hands.  As steam rises from the surface of the
liqueur, she slowly inhales.  Her head is shaved and her face both pleasant
and serene.  Her posture is rigid, an obvious example of her years of
monastic discipline.

expect of her people, as well as a decidedly pleasant demeanor.  Her hair is
short and blonde, complementing her light brown feathers.  She was taken on
as a student by Ral Kordarran in her youth, and has since proven herself a
capable acrobat and fighter.  Her looks and demeanor have made her popular
within the order, although she enjoys seeing new faces from abroad even
more.  A daughter of house Eshtrelle, she often looks for news of her home

Jacharan~
A tall, dark brown caladaran scholar is here.
~
Jacharan is a tall, dark brown caladaran, clad in a black robe.  His skin
is particularly rough, and the skin beneath his eyes sags deeply due to
advanced age.  Despite his ancient appearance, his posture is quite good,
giving him an oddly regal bearing.  He was once a famous traveling sage,
noted for his knowledge of Avendar\@s history in many geographic locations. 
Legends say that as an elder, he earned the favor of Chadraln the Seer, and
was given a breath of new vigor.  His name has faded from the pages of the
history which has so defined him, but his research continues, as timeless as
the multiverse he studies.

somewhat more expensive make; the leather soles are unmistakably

The story within the order is that he developed them to demonstrate to the
young members of the tradition that all things were possible with the
blessing of Jalassa.  It is said that to create them, he needed greater
insight than he possessed, and during his meditation, had the revelation
that liqueur was the key.  After the construction of the distillery and his
first taste of the famous temple brew, they say that he gained the
inspiration he initially sought.

The shortsword Starlight is assuredly the mate of the rapier Moonlight,
meant for the off-hand of the rapier\@s wielder.  It is designed along an old
Harrudim style, which often used fanciful names for paired duelling weapons.
The silvery glint to the blade suggests the name is more than just a fancy,
however; you recognize the metal as being of a rare sort which reacts to the
light of stars.  You are unsure how the blade ended up with the Ashana
family, though their rumoured connections are extensive enough that a
curiosity like this sword would be well within their reach.

wire of the hilt is a style that was once popular there many years ago. 
Both the name of the sword and the red shimmer of the blade suggest an
invocation of Rhos.  That, and simply that it is a weapon lead you to
suspect it consecrated to the goddess Lilune.  How such a weapon came into
the hands of the Ashana family of Earendam is a mystery, though their
merchant ties give them enough clout that they could easily come into such a
thing.

moonlight slender rapier red~
A faint red shimmer limns the blade of this long, thin rapier, more
apparent in darkness than in light.  The basket hilt is made of some white
metal, the pattern of the wires such that when one looks at the blade with
the flat up, the outline of two moons, one full, and one crescent can be
seen.  A cabochon moonstone is set in the pommel, reflecting rainbows amidst
its myriad inclusions.

Inside the Monastery Gatehouse~
Two heavy stone arches mark the inner and outer doors to the gatehouse,
both cut from the heavy wood of Karacha firs.  The stonework of the
gatehouse is comprised of large, rounded stones, and the flagstones that
start underfoot are smoothed with the feet of centuries.  The vaulted
ceiling bears a single, wrought iron mount and a globe of light.  The
pointed tips of a portcullis can be seen just inside both doors, jutting out
a few feet from the ceiling.  The stone path to the east leads to the trail
approaching the monastery.  To the west is the courtyard of the Hakurah
shrine.

A wide courtyard greets those who come to the Hakurah monastery, its
flagstones smoothed with the passage of many feet.  Despite the harsh

the northern wind.  Westward lies the renowned Hakurah temple, famed for its
ancient, manual construction and the spectacular crystal window set into the
eastern half of its dome.  South of the courtyard lies a flourishing
vegetable garden.  The gatehouse into the monastery lies to the east,

A wide courtyard greets those who come to the Hakurah monastery, its
flagstones smoothed with the passage of many feet.  Despite the harsh
weather, the grounds are clean, free of debris that could be whipped up by
the northern wind.  The entrance to the Hakurah temple opens to the west,
its ancient, hand-cut stones taken from the ravine itself.  The entryway
itself is modest in comparison to the thirty-foot peak of the crystal window
that surmounts the shrine.  South of the courtyard is a flourishing
vegetable garden.  To the north is a long, sloped building which follows the
ravine wall, while the gatehouse to the monastery awaits to the east.

A Vegetable Garden~
A flourishing vegetable garden reaches from the courtyard\@s edge to the
southern ravine wall.  The soil within has been imported on the backs of the
monastery\@s pilgrims, from richer lands to the south.  Thin rows of plants
are maintained by the Hakuran monks, sorted into various sections by stones
or wood.  A small stone shed has been built against the inside of the
monastery\@s protective wall, situated to the east.  A sloped building stands
to the south, where the monastery\@s balms are produced.  To the west, the
garden continues.  Beyond the garden to the northwest is the temple and its
great crystal window.

Following the southern ravine wall, the vegetable garden occupies all of

The guardhouse is situated above the gate to the monastery and provides
shelter to the monks currently assigned to keeping watch.  Much like the
dormitory proper, the guardhouse contains simple bedrolls and blankets for
the five watchmen.  Because of the many doors and ensuing draft, extra furs
cover the floor and augment the otherwise spartan accommodations.  A winch
lies at the east and west end of the guardhouse, allowing those within it to
raise or lower either portcullis.  Doors to the east and west lead to the
battlements.  A trapdoor in the floor leads to the armory, while another
leads upward.

Essentially the roof of the guardhouse, this watchman\@s post is little
more than a square platform with low, thick stone walls.  From here, the
monks on guard duty have a commanding view of the Ryarl and any potential
threats.  A bronze bell sits within a sturdy bracket, serving as an alarm. 
The view from here of the Brintors is particularly breathtaking, as is the

to stand on their side in the corner until they can be cleaned.  Wide
benches occupy the center and walls of the kitchen, covered with cooking
utensils, herbs, and foodstuffs.  A doorway leads northward to the larder. 
The dining house is behind a stout door to the west, and the shrine proper
waits through another door to the south.

onions, garlic, and other roots.  Sacks, crates and wooden boxes of

large painted mural northern wall history jalassa~
This great mural covers much of the wall, painted in a variety of vivid
browns, reds, greens, and whites.  It depicts the exodus of the ancient
caladaran from the Rirro Jagka and the many locales between their humble
glades and the far Brintors.  Stylistically, the artistry is not suggestive
of realism, but possesses a dream-like or memory-like quality to it. 
Glades, fields, jungles, swamps, mountains, are all accounted for, each
striking in its bold abstraction.  A haloed caladaran figure walks at the
fore, representative of the Arbiter Herself, while other more mundane
caladaran subjects follow behind.

A smaller chamber which adjoins the great hall provides an unusually cozy
space is reserved for meditation.  In the center is a low table, upon which
a decanter of heated alcohol is placed for the attending monks.  Surrounding
the table is a circle of dyed reed mats, which sit directly upon the stone
floor.  Perhaps from the heat of the drinks served, this room has noticeably
less of that ravine\@s chill clinging to it.  The walls here bear the simple
adornment of classical caladaran meditative symbols, each intended to give
focus to those who see it.  A door is set into the west wall, while the
stone interior continues to the east and south.

A Solitary Rock Garden~
The great rock of the ravine opens here, providing a view of the sky
above.  The bare rock floor has been covered thick by imported ivory sands. 
Placed here and there throughout this reasonably sized depression are larger
rocks, sand filling the space in between.  The natural walls of the ravine
remain intact, giving the enclosure a desolate feel, as it lacks water and
plant life.  The natural obstructions of the ravine keep the majority of the
elements out, with a barely perceptible field of magic blocking the rest.  A
set of rakes leans against the wall near the eastern doorway, which returns
to the stone interior.

The Testing Area~
This portion of the great stone chamber is divided off by a wooden frame
with nearly opaque, white paper windows.  The floor is covered by woven
reeds, and the walls are adorned only with simple iron mountings for light. 
Within the enclosure are a variety of objects for a budding psionicist to
test themselves upon.  A reasonably sized ball, a stone bearing a rune of
fire, and a heavy stone cube are prominent among them.  The stone and wooden
frame open only to the north, providing an exit to the training area.

A Serene Enclosure~
Enclosed on two sides by wooden frames with white paper windows, this
space is reserved for the Hakurah shrine\@s psionic master.  The floor here
is smooth, cool, and mostly bare, its only covering a meditation mat set
back near the southern wall.  Before it sits a wide, low table fashioned
from the firs of the nearby Karacha woods.  The enclosure is illuminated by
small orbs of light which hover near the carved ceiling.  A vivid mural is
painted upon the southern wall, lit by ambient light of the ravine\@s
interior.  The great open expanse of the chamber waits to the north.

the mural focuses the eyes of any looking upon it on the perfect inner
complexity of the subject, revealing finer patterns within the larger
structure.  At the figure\@s center is a radiating white light, which adds
additional, faint rainbow highlights in an artist\@s dreamy rendition of

A short hall is driven into living rock of the ravine.  Small, hard
benches line the southern wall, providing some cold comfort to the
monastery\@s devoted.  The stone floor is uncovered, and while swept free of
dust and debris, remains cold to the touch.  The walls are mostly unadorned
except for wrought iron mountings bearing glowing orbs of light.  To the
east is a reinforced door which leads into the temple proper, while
additional chambers await to the north and west.

The largest chamber within ravine interior is the practice circle, where
Hakuran assassins test their acrobatics, kicks, and hand to hand techniques.
A thick, woven carpet covers the stone floor to soften the impact of falls
or throws, with the circle itself dyed into the fabric.  The walls are
mounted with wrought iron light-holders, illuminating the circle for
students to clearly see the matches.  The ambient temperature is slightly
warmer, and the air thick with the musty scent of exertion.  To the east
leads back toward the shrine proper, while a dark, curving corridor
continues to the west.

It is slightly narrower than the larger room to the east, and culminates in
an iron-bound door.  The floor here is uncovered and cool, the clinging
chill of the ravine sticking to its surface.  There are no mountings for
light here, leaving the uneven walls nakedly bare.  To the east is the
practice circle, from which the hall gains its little ambient light.

This alcove largely serves as a bridge to the meditation area to the west

the sign of the senses, which the assassins of old named \#chi\#.  The alcove
itself is empty to the naked eye aside from this symbol and a few wrought
iron supports the interior\@s dim light.  Shadows play upon the smooth, grey
walls and uneven floor, their patterns changing when wisps of smoke cross
the low, static lights.  To the south is the short hall which leads back to
the Hakurah shrine proper.

the sign of grace, the sign of stealth, and the caladaran sigil of the mind.
Each sign is wrought in a darker bronze, providing more of a muted,

Part of the long, high hall on the north side of the ravine, the

warm and the air thick with humidity, much more akin to places far south of
the Ryarl.  Druidic signs line the various planters, providing unexpected
vivacity to the flora growing in this chamber.  A rough central table allows
a workspace for grinding and extracting fluid from the plants for refinement
into poison.  A field of magic preserves the climate of the room, and

The Hakurah temple is an expansive, perfectly circular hall which spreads

stone, hand-laid by the first ancient monks.  Carved octagonal panels
interlock in a repeating pattern, oiled and polished to give the walls a
rich wooden sheen.  A dark, unadorned carpet hugs the wall with a spur to
soften the way from the entryway to the altar to the west.  Between the
carpets, dark brown octagonal tiles are arranged in a complex repeating
pattern and provide a stable surface for free-standing braziers.  Far above,
the apex of the shrine\@s grey dome rises about thirty feet.  A simple spiral
staircase winds upward to a wooden gantry along the dome\@s base.  The shrine

The Great Altar of Hakurah~
At the center of the shrine is a large altar, cut from the same grey
stone as the temple itself.  Most notably, it is imperfect enough to be
recognizably built by mortal hands, rather than magic or divinity.  Upon the
altar\@s surface are the embers of previous sacrifices and the darkening of
ages of devotion.  Legends say that the altar was built by Hakurah, one of
Jalassa\@s early chosen who led the ancient caladaran across the Brintor
Mountains.  The spectacular crystal window, etched with a breathtakingly
perfect snowflake, directs natural light onto the altar itself, both purely
and refracted.  A spur of carpet leads eastward, to the temple\@s arched
entryway, while the tiled expanse of the interior extends in all other

massive crystal window~
A spectacular crystal window has set into the stone of the Hakurah
shrine\@s dome-roof.  Upon its flawless surface is etched a snowflake of
unbelievable enormity, its lines and facets perfect in every way.  Legends
say that while Hakurah and the early caladaran monks attempted to build the
shrine to their goddess, Jalassa, they were beset by hardships, harsh
winters, and other struggles.  With only part of the dome completed, Hakurah
beseeched the Arbiter for Her aid, and the miracle She provided was the
crystalline perfection of the shrine\@s famous window.  Its slightly curved
ovoid shape captures and focuses the morning sun, directing it onto the
altar at the shrine\@s center.

A Small Distillery~
The back wall of this small room is devoted to a pair of woodstoves made
of sturdy clay bricks, with a small woodpile in the corner.  Large copper
stills are set atop the stoves, lovingly polished to gleaming.  Copper tubes
run off them up to the ceiling, then into a surprisingly intricate pattern
downwards, to a sealed vat.  Several tools sit neatly on a rack next to it. 
A small rack holding wine-casks sits on the opposite side of the room.  A
small chimney gouged into the rock above provides venting for the steam,
though the chamber remains stiflingly warm.  A small wooden door leads to
the east.

wine wine-cask wine-casks cask casks barrel barrels~
Several casks of wine are stored in this room for distillation.  An empty
one sits beside the rack, but the others remain full.  All bear the mark of
a Thrandian vinyard noted for the quality of its fine white wines.

Hakurah Balms and Salves~
This shop front has been built beside a laboratory in which the monks
create the well-known temple balms.  The room is decorated simply, much as
the rest of the monastery, with wrought iron light mountings and woven reed
floor coverings.  A small hearth sits against the western wall to warm
visitors unused to the harsh northern weather.  A counter sits back against
the south wall for the shopkeeper, while an open doorway to the east leads
to the cookery.  A red door leads north, into the temple garden.

Before the Stone~
This portion of the great stone chamber is divided off by a wooden frame
with nearly opaque, white paper windows.  The floor here is covered by woven
reeds and the walls adorned only with simple iron mountings for light.  In
the middle of the enclosure is a thick stone, raised upon wooden blocks. 
The muted sounds of the ravine\@s interior hang heavy in the air, as does the
clinging chill of the northland.  The stone and wooden frame open only to
the north, providing an exit to the testing area.

The Hakuran Dormitory~
Part of the long, high hall on the north side of the ravine, the
dormitories provide the residents of the Hakurah shrine with a place to
rest.  The accommodations are spartan at best, with each acolyte having
little more than a bedroll and a blanket.  Because of the proximity of the
ravine walls to the dormitory, there are no windows.  Instead, the ceiling
provides natural light by way of skylights.  There are no artificial lights
in the dormitory, making it ideal for resting.  The dormitory continues to
the east and west.

The End of the Hakuran Dormitory~
Part of the long, high hall on the north side of the ravine, the
dormitories provide the residents of the Hakurah shrine with a place to
rest.  The accommodations are spartan at best, with each acolyte having
little more than a bedroll and a blanket.  Because of the proximity of the
ravine walls to the dormitory, there are no windows.  Instead, the ceiling
provides natural light by way of skylights.  There are no artificial lights
in the dormitory, making it ideal for resting.  The dormitory comes to a
fairly abrupt end along with the ravine itself.  It continues to the east.

The Distillery Shop~
The front of the distillery is built in much the same style as the
dormitory on the north side of the ravine.  It has a roof which slants
upward with its top against the southern ravine wall and solid construction
from nearby materials.  The interior cuts into the rock not far to the west,
with the rest of the distillery within.  The floor here is covered by woven
reed mats, and the walls are adorned with simple wrought iron mountings for
globes of light.  A long fir counter sits off the south wall, giving the
monks a place to collect money for their famous liqueur.  The monastery
garden is through a door to the north.

A Cluttered Laboratory~
This building has been outfitted to make the various salves and oils used
by the Hakuran order.  There are a number of large pots and various clay
brick stoves, and large supplies of base oil, bees wax, and herbal extracts
stored in corners, boxes, and shelves.  Glass jars sit ready to hold and
store the completed balms.  The room is mostly undecorated save for some
wrought iron mountings for lights.  Through a northern window, the monastery
garden is visible, while a shopfront has been set up through the western
doorway.
