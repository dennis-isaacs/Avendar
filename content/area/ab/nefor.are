You stand upon a barren hillside, alone save for a war-banner of plain silver-gray.
You reach towards the banner-pole to take it up, but find it too heavy to lift.
Mustering all of your strength, you at last raise it high.  Light shines around you.
The burden of its weight nearly causes you to fall. You attempt to set it down.
Your hands have become grafted onto the banner!  You cannot let go of it!
Stumbling awkwardly, you trip and fall, struggling to keep the banner aloft.
You cannot keep it raised, and at last the gray ensign touches the soil.
The ensign sinks through the earth, as if in quicksand--and it begins to draw you down with it!
~
>data_prog 2~
You are elderly, white gray-white hair the runs down over your shoulders.
You are standing on a high, stony precipice, a band of imposing companions behind you.
{Y\@We have found it!  At last, we\@ve found it!\@{x you exclaim in an aged voice.
Cheers and victorious cries ring out from your companions.
You reach down, and from a crack in the stone, pluck out a solitary flower.
A suddenly wind whips around you, and you feel...odd.  Light.  You begin to glow.
Rising up into the air, you survey the scene as if from another\@s eyes.  Your companions drop to a knee.
You hang suspended in mid-air, and suddenly lightning flashes.  You experience pain greater than any you\@ve ever felt before.
~
>data_prog 1~
In your dream, you rest at the altar of balance in the temple of Var Bandor.
The altar begins to hum lightly, dispersing the fine layer of dust upon it.
Lines of glowing silver begin to move along its surface, writing out runes and symbols.
You approach the altar and reach down a hand to touch a large symbol, the triangled eye.
Within the triangle, the eye turns, focusing upon you. The air hums with unseen energy.
Under the gaze of the eye, a dual sense of peace and purpose begins to swell within you.
The glowing runes suddenly fade, and you feel a sharp pain where you touched the altar.
You look at your hand. Your fingers are cut and bleeding. Crimson drops stain the altar.

You are elderly, white gray-white hair the runs down over your shoulders.
You are standing on a high, stony precipice, a band of imposing companions behind you.
{Y\@We have found it!  At last, we\@ve found it!\@{x you exclaim in an aged voice.
Cheers and victorious cries ring out from your companions.
You reach down, and from a crack in the stone, pluck out a solitary flower.
A suddenly wind whips around you, and you feel... strange.  You begin to glow.
Rising up into the air, you survey the scene as if from another\@s eyes.  Your companions drop to a knee.
You continue to ascend, and your new aura, shimmering prismatically, grows in brilliance.  You disappear into the clouds, your light illuminating them from within.
~
>data_prog 4~
You are again a child of 10, in the market of Ranerin on a bright spring day.
You wait as your mother haggles with a vendor.  She moves away, seeking another vendor.
A ring of village children close in around you.
A large human sneers, {Y\@So, finally left your mlittle hidey-hole, did you?\@{x
Time and senses blur.  Blinking, you clear your eyes and see yourself much older than you are now, and ringed by threatening warriors.
A grim voice rings out through the dark of night, {Y\@So, it has finally come, has it?\@{x
{Y\@Yes, it has,\@{x a distant voice responds.  The warriors turn and find themselves, in turn, surrounded.  They drop their weapons.
You cannot see what encircles the warriors--in the dimness you make out only shadowy forms.
~
>data_prog 3~
You stand upon a barren hillside, alone save for a war-banner of plain silver-gray.
You reach towards the banner-pole to take it up, but find it too heavy to lift.
Mustering all of your strength, and casting your fortifying spells, at last you lift it.
The burden of its weight nearly causes you to fall.  You attempt to set it down.
Your hands have become grafted onto the banner!  You cannot let go of it!
Stumbling awkwardly, you trip and fall, struggling to keep the banner aloft.
You cannot keep it raised, and at last the gray ensign touches the soil.
The ensign sinks through the earth, as if in quicksand--and it begins to draw you down with it!

A paunchy nefortu flutters awkwardly here, his nut-brown skin gleaming
like polished leather.  Jowls and folds of skin hang limply from his neck
and throat, his pointed ears tattooed with intricate designs.  He peers
about with beady eyes seeking potential customers, causing his numerous
earrings to jingle when his head moves.  A merchant from the sea-cave of
Rahh-Nefor, he travels regularly to Var Bandor to sell his unique wares. 
His aggressive salesmanship and free-spirited nature have made him a fixture
among adventurers.

Page Two -- Notes on Rahh-Nefor
-------------------------------
  I spoke with various nefortu to collect this information:  a merchant, a
few drunks at in the common area up in the stalactites, and an old fellow
who demanded 50 gold before he would say a word.  Everyone else just 
sneered when I approached them.  Well, if 50 gold were always the price
of knowledge, we Seekers would be poor but happy.
  The Nefortu call this vast sea cavern Rahh-Nefor.  In their language, it
means \@Sea Nefortu\@, and designates both their particular colony, and the
name of this gigantic cavern.
  The Rahh-Nefor struggle constantly against the granite drakes that roost
in the southern area of the cave, in a giant crevice.  The drakes primarily
feed on fish, a drunk told me, but then he showed me a nasty scar and told
me that they didn\@t think twice about eating a slow nefortu.  Yesterday,
my own travelling companion was slain by a drake with viscious
talons, so I don\@t doubt the drunk was very lucky in his encounter.
  When I asked about their leadership, I got sneers and chuckles in
response.  I did manage to find out from the old fellow that there are
three primary figures in a nefortu colony:  the leader of the Ajim-Chiaj,
who organizes their military; the soothsayer, who serves as a religious
leader and is often a shaman with powers connected to fire, air, and void;
and the matron, the oldest nefortu female, who has the responsibility to
care for the young, because after nefortean parents give birth they do
not care for their offspring.
  Other than that, the civilization is quite unstructured compared to those
of the other races of Avendar.  I wasn\@t told directly, but could infer
that the Ajim-Chiaj doesn\@t exist so much to battle the drakes as they do
to keep order among the large rogue population--with a people so chaotic
and mischevious, often downright evil, the Ajiam-Chiaj is a necessity just
to keep the population stable.
  Let me see, what else... ah yes, diet and dress.  The Rahh-Nefortu, like
the drakes, feed primarily on fish and seaweeds found in the large sea
below their dwellings.  They do have occasional merchant visitors, keep
diplomatic relatioships open with the nearby Shuddeni, and are quite aware
of the styles and events up on the surface world.  The most notable dress
habit of the Rahh-Nefor is their use of rings--ear rings, wing rings,
even toe rings.  The main merchant in the cavern is a ring trader.
  Well--these notes will suffice until I have time to prepare my treatise
on Rahh-Nefor for the Assembly.

Part One:  The Journey to the Sea Cavern
========================================
10 o\@clock pm, Day of Freedom, 18th the Month of the Heat.
After considerable discussion, Pohe, Gylion, and I finally conviced Gwyd
to join us on a venture to the far-off caverns of the Rahh-Nefor.  I had
enlisted Pohe and Gylion, long-time travelling companions, quite easily
as they are never ones to turn down the chance to explore a new corner of
Avendar. We set out in morning. The reports of this venture will be sure
to make a fine presentation for the Assembly!
 
 
7 o\@clock pm, Day of the Great Gods, 21st the Month of the Heat.
According to the directions I obtained from a portly merchant who spoke
to us of the caves a few days ago, we followed south and west along
the Dantaron.  We used the first of our supply of flight potions to
get over the huge waterfall that spills from the mountain lake that is
the source of the Dantaron. The beauty of the falls and the mountain lake
requires a bard\@s tongue to do it justice.  We camped on the west shore
of the lake, where the dark tunnel leading to Rahh-Nefor begins.  Gwyd
had been a bit melancholy--like most rangers, he is a man of the open
spaces, and despises deep, dark caverns.  He has been suffering from a
cold as well. A fine-looking mountain hawk that lives on the lake\@s edge
has been speaking with him; perhaps his animal friend will acompany us
and help cheer him up.
 
11 o\@clock pm, Day of the Great Gods, 22nd the Month of the Heat.
The descent through the tunnels was a testament as to why this place is
so little-known on the surface.  Vertical drops through thin shafts of
stone, an aggressive formation of eslingalis, species verdithius (common
name-verdah slime), and dangerous blasts of wind through a narrow
lava vent kept us on our toes.  Once into the great cavern, we spent
most of the day scouting around the southern half of the sea, finding
little more than fish and the neforteans who fished for them.
 
 
Tragedy struck our group today shortly after making camp around 7 pm.
We had stopped in a cavern, nearly hidden in a recess on a narrow
ledge along the western side of the lake. Before we had even set up watch,
we were attacked by a small granite drake.  Gylion was slain--alas that
we brought no water scholar--before we could wound the drake and drive
it away.  I created a small tremor to hide the cavern entrance with
rubble and boulders, lest the drake return to feed on our friend\@s corpse. 
 
 
Though we are all quite sad over the loss of Gylion, Pohe is in a fury.
He vows to see how well the drakes fight a prepared group.  Tomorrow,
I\@m sure he\@ll have ample opportunity to fulfill the vow, as we explore the
northern half of the sea and the lower air levels, and I attempt to glean
information about this place from its residents.

The Crimson Hand
----------------
One reason I am taking this journey is to discover any information available
regarding the rumors of a powerful assassin cult that has established itself
here in Rahh-Nefor.  Everyone I have spoken with so far about this cult has
denied its existence or claimed to have no knowledge of it.  Some nefortu
grow angry when it is mentioned, and a srryn merchant I approached on the
matter grew so furious that he nearly set his guards on me.

To call the Lord from his repose,

Nimansday, the Twelfth of Kyanamir

...Borandus is the name of the scholar who wants to try the experiment.  He
claims that he has perfected a new version of the \@Meld with Water\@ spell
that can move far more than just a handful of people -- he claims it can
move an entire ship and its contents!  

Most captains would scoff at the notion, but I own the Ilal today because I
was willing to take risks.  And, unlike many of the other daft sea dogs who
ply the Uthlin, I don\@t have any superstitions about Iandir-knows-what
dragging my ship under the waves for trafficking with scholars.  

The fellow seems to have ties to the Tower, or at least, is independently
wealthy as well.  When I expressed concerned about ending up in mid-air, or
even parts unknown, Borandus provided gold to hire air scholars (I once had
to transport the ship overland this way -- expensive, but effective) and a
contingent of warriors from the Thrantian school.  For myself, I made sure
we had extra supplies, and got a half dozen more sailing men to replace the
ones who\@d left after the last long voyage.  The test is scheduled two days
from now, and Borandus wants to sail from Uthlin to the Lidraeu, some
distance off the shore of Gaald.  It\@s a long shot, but I\@ve taken a cargo
of fine silks and Lithling wine on board.  Even if we don\@t make it to
Gaald, there\@s always a demand for the finer things eastward along the
Uthlin.  
~
E

Thethelsday, the Thirteenth of Kyanamir

We departed Earendam today, leaving the city\@s docks on the Dantaron. 
Thanks to the presence of the air scholars, we made on our northeasterly
course with all speed.  Borandus tells us that we must be sufficiently far
from land for the spell to work, and I intend to oblige him.  

Nothing else of note, except that we have reached our destination by
nightfall.  I had an excellent dinner in my quarters with Borandus and
Hajja, the head of the warriors from the Thrantian school.  Hajja is a keen
hand with his blade, and Borandus knows the ocean currents as well as any
captain I\@ve known.  If his magic is as good as his gold and his sea lore, I
expect to be sipping Gaald ale by sunset tomorrow.  
~
E
pagethree~
[Here, the captain\@s hand undergoes a notable change -- straightforward,
clean lines are replaced by a hand that is obviously trembling, as if from
excitement.  ] 

Evenday, the Thirteenth of Kyanamir

I...  Words cannot begin to describe what has befallen the fate of my ship
and my crew, but I must record it, if only that I might not believe it
ourselves if I did not take a written record.  

The day dawned, and Borandus made preparations for casting the spell.  He
bid the air scholars to cease their magics, concerned that their be no other
form of magical interference.  He stood on the foredeck, and cast his spell.
His voice rose and fell as part of some high chant, and a living warmth
swept through the ship.  

The mighty spell took hold, and I could feel the entire ship beginning to
flow into the ocean....  And then there was a horrible, deadly wrenching. 
Every part of me cried out in agony.  Like a thousand nettles, all jabbed
into the soft parts of your body.  

Most all of us collapsed, some for hours, others, for a few moment. 
Borandus lay slumped on the foredeck, blood trickling from his ears.  
~
E
pagefour~
As I write this now, we still have no idea where the ship is, I can still
make no reckoning that will locate us.  The sky is utterly dark, save for a
single red star far in the north.  There is not a trace of wind, and the air
is stale and foul.  

I had the men light torches on the deck, and that is when we made our most
disturbing discovery.  We float on a sea of some black liquid, slightly
thicker than water and with none of its wholesome properties.  It is
probably the source of the foulness of the air, and it reeks of
putrefaction.  We tried sounding the depths with our anchor, but could find
no bottom.  

Lacking any sign of land, I instructed the air scholars to generate wind for
the sails, and set course in the direction of the red star.  Borandus is
comatose, so I have set him up in my own bed, as it is all we can do.  

There is no rising or setting of the sun here, and even the red star is
listless and unchanging in the sky.  I end this log entry by candle as I
prepare to sleep, all frame of reference lost.  
~
E
pagefive~
Darkness, Second Entry

I awoke in the night to a scream of absolute horror.  I rushed out of my
cabin, sword in hand.  A goodly number of the crew were gatHered around a
storage hold.  We opened the door, and 

[Here, the ink is blotted as if the captain stopped for too long with pen to
page] 

and one of the new men I\@d taken on board in Earendam was there,
eviscerated.  A ghastly caricature of the man had part of his face and
skull, and was busy implanting the grisly totem into a blob of blackish goo.
The crewman\@s body dangled upside down in the room, its blood drained into a
brackish pool in an obsidian bowl placed below it.  

The thing..  The doppelganger screeched at us, and leaped at me.  I slashed
at it, in a futile effort to drive it back.  It grew claws, and sliced at my
throat.  I stepped back, just as one of the air scholars arrived, and
blasted the thing with lightning.  It hit one of the torches on the wall,
and caught fire almost immediately.  It yelled and screeched with its eerie
keening, and within just a few minutes was consumed.  
~
E
pagesix~
After we had moved aside what little remained of its body, we were free
to examine the room.  The crewman, a human of the name of Kantru, had
obviously been using this room as some sort of crude magical laboratory.  A
few scrolls and notes were open on crates near the center of the room, where
an odd spiral shape had been painted in his own blood on the floor.  His
body, or what was left of it, had been dead for some hours.  

It was the air scholar who set me onto this line of thought, and I can\@t put
it out of my head now.  

\#What if,\# he said, in that pedantic tone scholars use, \#This wretch were
trying to conjure a demon while Borandus was casting his spell?  Could that
have set us awry?\#  

I took several scrolls from Kantru\@s tunic, and ordered the men to throw the
body overboard.  He doesn\@t deserve a grave in the sea, as the gods alone
know what he was really doing in my ship.  

After posting guards, I went back to my cabin to sleep and to write this, if
only to organize my thoughts.  
~
E
pageseven~
Darkness, Third Entry

The first thing I did when I awoke was to puzzle through the parchments I
found on the recently departed \#crewman\#.  Some of the scrolls were
obviously spells -- meaningless mystical scribblings to me, but I could see
that Kantru was no true sailor -- he was at least a journeyman scholar. 
More troubling, I found a scrap of a letter, from Kantru to a merchant in
Earendam of the name of Bahand.  

Kantru promised in the letter that, \#the captain will meet his doppelganger
and be dealt with before we next meet.  I expect payment in the usual
location.\#  Bahand is the leader of a small consortium of merchants in
Earendam I refused to trade with because I felt their prices were
exorbitant.  

I can only suppose that the creature Kantru summoned was this doppelganger,
only his spell had gone drastically wrong.  If it was his summoning which
disrupted Borandus\@ spell, then perhaps it cuts both ways, and he met a
horrible end at the hands of the demon he sought to bind with his own blood.


The rest of the day was relatively uneventful.  As far as I could tell, we
made no real progress in any direction, but it\@s hard to tell, owing to the
lack of landmarks and the fact that the accursed red star never moves a
degree.  

As I write this, there is little more to report than Borandus still lies
sleeping.  We poured water down his throat, but there was little more that
could be done.

...Morale is lower than ever.  This is my tenth entry since the darkness,
and there seems to be no change.  Rather than let fear seize the crew, I let
one of the air scholars spread his theory that we are in some deep
underground sea, and the red light is a clump of fungus.  I told them to
keep watch for signs of shuddeni, thinking an enemy the men were familiar
with might steel them.  

Borandus still lies unconscious, but his breathing is lighter now.  If he
awakens, perhaps his magic can ...  No, it is best not to garner false
hopes.  

I have a suspicion about our fate, but I will not voice it.

Darkness, Fifteenth entry

They attacked while most of us were sleeping.  It was against reason, but I
have kept burning our scant supply of torches each time the men were on
guard.  Call it luck, divine favor, or just cussedness on my part, but my
men saw the things when they emerged from the murk, and started clamber up
onto the ship.  

Some of them were lumps of goo, with mortal faces.  They cursed at us,
spitting a viscous poison at my men.  There were skeletons, covered with the
black waters of the sea, who clutched and clawed at the side of the ship,
dragging men down beneath the waters.  Finally, and most frighteningly,
there were doppelgangers, each of which took the form and abilities of one
of the defenders.  

It was not the hardest fight that I have ever faced, but I certainly have
never seen one more chilling.  I watched Hajja slash through the blobs with
his blades, and tripping an opponent who looked exactly like him off the aft
of the ship.  Then, as I was locked in combat with a half dozen skeletons, I
was forced to watch as two of my best men were dissolved and devoured by the
blobs.  
~
E
pageten~
The creatures seemed to flee from fire, or at least, displayed some small
aversion to the light it shed, and that helped us in finally putting paid to
them.  The fight ended, and most of us returned to our quarters, but I kept
a double watch.  

I think that it helped the men to have something to do other than fret and
bellyache, but...  I have already seen the cold fear in some of the eyes of
the younger seamen.  The things we fought tonight were not like anything I\@d
ever seen.  

I cannot voice my true suspicion yet.  It is too horrible, and it would kill
all hope in the men.

Darkness, Seventeenth Entry

Borandus is awake and about on his feet now, although, in my heart, I almost
rue his return now that I know the Truth.  

Borandus progressed rapidly in healing himself yesterday, using his magic to
help himself recover quickly.  He complained of the magic seeming sluggish,
almost weaker than it ought to be, but at first ascribed this as being a
result of the psychic trauma.  

When I took him out of my cabin, and showed him the place we were in, he
very nearly collapsed again.  He staggered, and the look on his face...  It
showed more pain than at any time when he had lain comatose.  

He motioned me back into the cabin, and told me ...  Something I can barely
put words to...  [here, the pen of the captain obviously trembles, and there
is another large inkblot.] 
~
E
pagethirteen~
I will forever remember the cold dread in Boranthus\@ voice.  

Captain, we are not underground, in some great moat of the shuddeni.  If
that were so...  If only that were so.  

Captain, where we are is barely a place at all.  

For we are in the Void.  

This ship, your crew, we all..  We are sailing across the Dead Sea, the Sea
that is Not.  We sail across the ichors of death and decay, in which no
living thing can grow.  

Overhead, that star in the sky.  It is no star.  It is the Eye of Bahhaoth,
queen of this place.  It gazes down, uncaring, on the unlife and
abominations of the Sea.  

You could sail for ten eternities, and not reach the edge of this place.  

I ..  I did not anticipate an acolyte of the void to attempt a potent spell
just as I cast.  The touch of the Void upon my magic twisted it.  Rather
than melding to another spot on the ocean, it took us to the closest thing
to an ocean...  Here in the Void.\#  

There were some moments of pregnant silence, as the news wormed its way into
my head.  
~
E
pagefourteen~
\\\#Can you not simply meld us into this sea, and take us home that way?\#  

I have already tried.  What we are on is not water.  And even if we could,
we are on the wrong the side of the Veil.  I do not have the magics required
to open it.  

Captain, I can only offer my humblest apologies for damning both you and
your crew.  I can see no way out of this dark place.  Tell your men what you
will, and I will aid you against however I can, but I recommend you make
your peace with the gods now.\#  

Before we slept that night, I called the men together, and told them what
Borandus had revealed.  Frankly, I felt that if we were to die, they
deserved the truth.  And, all told, they took it fairly well.  I think some
of them suspected that we were no longer in Avendar, and we had fought
demons in this place.  A few paled, and one of the youngest fainted, but on
the whole there was grim silence.  

Really, I could see no possibility of mutiny here, in this place.  What
would they do with the ship?  Where would they go, or do that we weren\@t not
already trying?  No, my deepest fear was the despair it might have on my
shipmates.

Darkness, Twenty-third Entry:

Another attack by the denizens of this place.  Only one casualty this time,
but I can see the light in the men\@s eyes die a little more each day.  They
wonder why they are fighting this fight, when a cleaner death would come at
the hands of their own blades.

Darkness, Twenty-fifth Entry:

They found my first mate, swinging from the yard arm where he had hung
himself.  I cut him down myself, as I had too much respect for the man to
see anyone else do it.  

I wondered what to do with the body -- I didn\@t have the heart to toss it
into the foul darkness over the edge of the boat.  Borandus offered to dry
the body out by draining the water, so we could store it in a makeshift
coffin (a crate, really) without the smell.  

As we were getting a crate from the store room where that accursed void
scholar had cast his spell, Borandus saw the remaining trappings of the
ritual and cried out,

\#Of course!  I have it!\#  

And with that, he and three of the air scholars locked himself in my cabin,
excitedly discussing something.  

Disgruntled, I wrote this, and rested in my mate\@s cabin.  A little morbid,
but I\@m not fool enough to sleep on deck in this place.  
~
E
pageseventeen~
Darkness, Tweny-Sixth Entry:

Today, there is hope.  Borandus and the scholars invited me into my cabin,
and laid out what they think could be a plan.  

Borandus assumed his lecturing tone, which I have become all too familiar
with in recent days.  

\#As you may or may not be aware, Avendar and the Void are separated by a
border region, what demonologists refer to as \@The Silver Veil\@.  This
thing, this structure, prevents free travel from the Void to our own world. 


It can be bypassed, of course, if sufficient magical energy is used to
travel to another plane (very difficult in the negative energy well that is
the void), or to open a hole in the Veil.  

It\@s something of a mystery how the Veil was constructed -- some say the
gods placed it there, to save the world from ruin.  Others maintain it\@s a
natural phenomena, a natural membrane between worlds.  Yet others believe
that it was created by the alatharya, who wanted more control over
demonkind, and created a planar artifact of ancient magic.  And the scholar
Akkarlis writes that...\#  
~
E
pageeighteen~
\\\#Get to the point!\#, shouted one of the air scholars.  

Yes, as I was saying.  We do not possess the resources or the wherewithal to
open our own gate through the Veil.  However, any scholar of the void opens
a weakness, or a tear in the Veil whenever he or she conjures a demon.  I am
certain that this place is home to some of the demons that those dark
sorcerers draw from -- your experience with the doppelganger in the hold
proves that.  

That means that, periodically, gates from Avendar to this place, the Dead
Sea, must open.  It is theoretically possible that we could use these holes,
or gates, or bridges, or what have you to escape from here.  

There are several problems, however.  

Firstly, there is the matter of finding the gate when it opens.  We have
discussed mechanisms for finding this, and I believe the air scholars and I
have found a way.  Our magic (as, indeed, all elemental magic other than
negation) is slightly less strong here, on the Void.  

As the boundary between our two planes softens, we should detect our magic
becoming imperceptibly stronger.  We need only follow the path of greatest
strength.\#  
~
E
pagenineteen~
\\\#The second problem is the fly in our ointment.  These portals, when they
open, are designed to call forth a demon.  But here, in this dark place, all
the demons dwell below the surface of this foul sea.  

In retrospect, your insistence on air scholars may be our salvation.  

When we find a gate, the air scholars will blast the sea with air, making a
whirlpool.  We must sail the Ilal into the maw of the maelstrom, and I will
call forth to the seas as we reach the gate.  The oceans will touch the
veil, and I will cast my spell a second time.  If the gods smile, we will be
transported from this prison.  

If we fail, we will end our lives buried in the Dead Sea, but I can see no
other fate for us than slow starvation as we sail mindlessly under that
maddening red Eye.\#  

I agreed immediately.  Could it be any other way?  

Borandus grinned, \#I thought you might see it that way.  There is one more
potential..  Ah..  Pitfall.\#  
~
E
pagetwenty~
\\\#If we expend this much magical energy in one place, it will almost
certainly draw the attention of the denizens of the plane.  If we have
escaped the Queen\@s notice so far, she will certainly know we are here as we
make our escape.  When we are ready, you must prepare the men for combat. 
We may have to fight our way out.\#  

I put my hand on my sword, nodded, and left them to finalize their plans.

Darkness, Twenty-ninth entry:

[Large ink blotch] We have found a gate which is opening.  We are heading
there with all speed.  Borandus says we will make it in time.  The stench
from the sea is thicker now, and the air is expectant.  I cannot sleep as
[incomprehensible] waits for me in my sleep.  I will be ready.  
~
E
pagetwentytwo~
Darkness, Thirtieth Entry:

[This last entry in a hurried, crabbed hand, as if written in an enormous
hurry.  ] 

This will likely be my last entry.  We have found the gate, and now, the
Ilal heads directly into the maw of the largest whirlpool I have seen in my
waking life.  

As soon as the scholars began the incantation to make it, the seas began to
boil with activity.  Wave after wave of demon and undead emerged, their
sickly slurping a dark chorus to our work.  

The Thrantian warriors pushed them back again and again, while my men and I
backed them up.  I had them light the last of our torches -- if this does
not work, we will have no need of them.  The doppelgangers came next, and
were almost successful -- one took my place, and was directing the crew to
attack themselves.  

The first part of the casting was done, and a dark eye opened in the water. 


Now, I am at the wheel of the ship, in the wheelhouse near the middle of the
deck.  I write this as we turn and move toward the whirlpool.  Skeletons are
thick about the structure, but I have an old rune I bought several trips ago
to lock the door.  
~
E
pagetwentythree~
They clatter outside.  My men and the last of the Thrantians are now on
the foredeck, and they have set fire to the main deck to keep the demons
off.  Desperate, but it was my emergency strategy.  

Now, in the light of the fire, I see reflected in the maelstrom, the Gate. 
A shuddeni is near a lake, his spiral drawn in river mud.  I wonder if gazes
out into the darkness, to see ...  Us?  

Borandus calls out words of power, and they are the sweetest words anyone
has ever spoken.  The demons jeer and cackle, slightly diminished by the
spell.  

But then, I see my crew cry out.  SHE arises from the depths.  Bahhaoth,
Borandus names her, blackest ooze shaped into an impossibly horrible female
form.  She reaches for the ship, and I know she reaches out to pull it back.
~
E
pagetwentyfour~
Now, I take my sword, and will open the door.  We are already whirling
the outer edge of the vortex.  The gate us near, but I must buy them time. 
My sword is in my hand, and her tendrils are at the door.  

I will see my crew safe, I swear it.

preserving the liver, brain, and blood, and smoking the meat.  Then the meat
and organs are placed in a wooden contraption much like a wine press, where
they are fermented with herbs and spices for twenty days.  Those more
steeped in the nefortu traditions will insist that eel paste only tastes
correct if the paste is constantly held close to the body during the
fermenting process.  \#Idkilha\# slings (loosely translated, \@body-close\@) are
still made by older generations for this purpose.  This custom extends so
far as sleeping with the maturing product.  After fermentation, the eel
paste is sealed in jars and aged for several more months before consumption.

A buoyant hammock of grey silk hangs magically in the air.~
The famed nefortean air mage, Jiyko, is said to have invented the buoyant
hammock between his other duties, including the telling stories, and the
enjoyment of food, drink, and women.  Hammocks are prized items among
cave-dwelling nefortu, because of their ease of hanging and casual comfort. 
A magical one, such as this, would offer the traveling nefortu the pleasures
of home without the meddlesome necessities of actually working, or anything
from which to hang it.

a tiny floating dirk~
A tiny dirk of steel floats in the air.~
The story of the floating dirk is intertwined with the folly of Noljech,
an incompetent but devious nefortean assassin.  After attempt after failed
attempt to assassinate a Bandorian merchant, Noljech devised a plan: he
would beseech Tzajai the Jester, and convince him to make him into the
greatest assassin in Avendar.  

By some odd stroke of chance, Noljech managed to get the attention of
Tzajai, who told him that whoever could beat him in a game of hide and seek
would be rewarded.  Noljech quickly agreed, and searched high and low for
the hiding place of the Jester.  He traveled to the far corners of the world
in pursuit, only to turn up empty-handed.  

Finally, in despair, Noljech flew to the top of Mount Khorak.  He let out a
loud, frustrated cry, and flung his dirk into the open air.  Astoundingly,
the blade managed to prick Tzajai; thus, the Jester declared the dirk the
winner of the contest, imbuing it with magical flight forever.

a pair of glittering golden wingblades~
A pair of glittering hinged wingblades forged from gold lie here.~
These magical wingblades are said to have been created by Tzajai the
Jester.  According to the legend, He created them to impress Ayaunj the
Sterling, whose love for all that glitters is unmatched by mortal or god
alike.  She was, of course, quite taken with the blades and wished to
possess them; Tzajai delighted in briefly commanding Her fascination.  

However, Ayaunj was cleverer than Tzajai anticipated, and challenged Him to
a series of games for possession of the blades.  Never to turn down any
game, Tzajai quickly accepted.  Ayaunj tricked Him into playing ludicrously
unfair games with labyrinthine rules, often thousands of pages in length. 
To win the last, Tzajai had to write His name in seven-hundred and thirteen
different places, as well as initial fourteen more.  

Upon His apparent victory, He taunted Ayaunj, who then revealed that the
final game was a spectacularly elaborate contract for possession of the
blades, as well as nine-hundred and seventy other treasures created by
Tzajai.  She claimed them all, and then sold most of them for a handy
profit.

Forged from gold, these wingblades are a segmented series of metal pieces
designed to fit over the unique curvature of a nefortean wing.  Low, curved
blades of sharpened steel arc along their outer edges.  A series of clasps
and leather harnesses secure them across the wings and about the torso,
aligned in such a way that the wearer would need to shrug into the
assemblage, one wing at a time.

the sea\@s otherwise glass-smooth surface.  A small island of stone is
visible towards the center of the sea.  High overhead, the stone walls rise
upward, dotted with caves and tunnels.  The gloomy atmosphere is oppressive,
and the stale air and faint smell of fish equally bland.

Entrance to the Underground Sea~
The grotto tunnels end here, as this cavern opens up westward into a huge
underground chamber blanketed in a dark sea.  Here, the walls begin to lose
the pale white of the grotto, and streaks of darker grey limestone can be
seen, barely covering the black stone underneath.  Sounds of activity, the
flapping of wings, and distant cries of battles can be heard echoing from

The Cabin of a Strange Vessel~
The cabin walls are fairly intact, having been spared from the fire that
burned portions of the deck.  There is low window that rings the cabin, and
still holds a few shards of scum-covered glass.  Towards the front of the
cabin, a short wooden pedestal stands.  

The sinuous, winding form of the Spiral of Bahhaoth is inscribed here.

symbolvision~
Images flicker at the edge of your vision as you study the spiral.  

Each glyph takes you to a different image, until they all blur together in
one unending experience.  

A ship sails on a dead sea, and a red eye looks down on it from above.  

A man takes the face of a woman who takes the face of a man who plunges a
dagger into another man\@s heart.  

Horrible, burbling things arise from the shores of a black ocean, basking in
a place that will never know light.  

Mortal flesh and black ooze are intermingled in the form of a cruel queen,
who laughs as she lashed out with oozing tendrils.  

Black fluid wraps itself around you.  Your throat is closed, and your lungs
ache with the burning of its page.  Your heart seizes...  

The visions are gone, and the image of the spiral is burned in your mind.

symbol~
This inscription is made from dozens of glyphs, each in sequence after
another, gradually tracing out the winding pattern of a spiral.  The
blasphemous runes twist and wind, each one a sinuous structure in its own
right, yet also blending into the next.  

This particular instance of the symbol pulses with a certain power all its
own.  Perhaps if you were to study it, you could learn more.

The Middle of the Sea~
The enormous sea cavern streches in all directions here.  The dark azure
waters are still, and below them, faint silhouettes drift and glide.  High
above the sea, the grey chamber walls are riddled with small caves.  The
walls rise up higher and higher, until they are lost in the distance. 
Directly to the west is a small stone island.

The Eastern Side of the Sea~
The enormous sea cavern stretches in all directions here, but to the
immediate south a large stalagmite rises up through the glassy water\@s
surface to block your way.  The waters are still, and faint silhouettes
drift and glide below.  High above, the grey stone walls are riddled with
smaller caverns, and rise up higher and higher until they are lost in the
distance.

Under a Low Ledge~
This ledge is about four feet wide, and only slightly clears the water. 
The stone walls to the west and north are smooth, and rise up into an
overhang that shelters the ledge.  The ledge continues south from here, and
ends back at the sea rim to the east.

The Deck of a Strange Vessel~
Half-disintegrated planks of the unusual vessel still hold together in a
recognizable deck.  A portion of the surviving railing shows intricate
woodwork, as do the sidewings which are fashioned to resemble extended
dragon wings.  The remaining woodwork on the starboard side shows signs of
scorches and burns.  To the east, the cabin door floats, barely attached by
one corroded hinge.

The Point of a Jagged Stalagmite~
This huge, jagged stalagmite has been worn down over time.  The dark grey
stone is rough, but generally level--it looks like a fang that has been
filed down.  It now serves as a porch for the cave that leads into the west
wall.

Above the Sea, Along the Eastern Wall~
You are about twenty feet above the sea\@s surface.  From this vantage
point, the water looks deep blue.  The grey stone walls of the cavern are to
the east, and rise higher and higher until they are lost in the distance. 
All along the walls are small cave or tunnel entrances.

The Top of a Crumbling Stalagmite~
This huge stalagmite has been worn over time, and is now beginning to
crumble.  The dark grey stone is almost level--it looks like a fang that has
been filed down.  It now serves as a porch for the cave that leads into the
east wall.

High Above the Sea, Along the Northern Wall~
The air is warmer here than down on the surface, and is as calm of the
waters of the sea.  Around you, the walls of the cavern are dotted with cave
entrances, but the majority are located along the northern and eastern
walls.  Far to the south, a crevice cuts into the wall, forming a huge
sheltered ledge.  Directly overhead, the cavern slopes inward cutting off
further upward movement.

High Above the Sea, Along the Eastern Wall~
The air is warmer here than down on the sea surface, and is as calm as
the sea waters.  All around, the walls of the cavern are dotted with cave
entrances.  To the north and the east, oval-shaped cave entrances have been
carved into the stone walls.  Far to the south, a crevice cuts into the
wall, forming a huge sheltered ledge.

Near the Stalactites, Along the Eastern Wall~
Here the vast ceiling of the giant chamber is visible.  Massive, pointed
stalactites hang down like daggers and spears from the ceiling.  The small
cave openings aren\@t limited to the chamber walls, but are carved up into
the stalactites themselves.  Far below, the underground sea is lost in the
distance and darkness.

Near the Stalactites, Along the Southeastern Wall~
Here the cavern wall slopes inward, cutting off upward movement.  The
cavern continues to rise upward to the north and west, however.  The air is
very warm at this level, and rather stale and stuffy.  To the east, an
oval-shaped cave entrance has been carved into the stone wall.

You are flying along the very top of the cavern, surrounded by
stalactites of varying lengths and thicknesses.  The air up here is
comfortably warm, and is moist enough that most of the stalactites have a
slow, rhythmic drip.  Only darkness is visible beneath you.  To the north

The Muskdrain Lair~
The tunnel ends here in a roughly rectangular chamber.  To the north of
the chamber, bones, rocks and pebbles, and bits of trash litter the ground. 
Many of the bones look like they are nefortean bones.  The exit to the
chamber leads back south into the twisted tunnels.

An Underwater Tunnel~
You have reached an intersection in a crooked, twisted tunnel.  Though
the tunnel bends back and forth at odd, but precise angles, one way leads
generally north, another to the west.  The third leads south, to the depths
of the underground sea.  The walls have been smoothed by the water over
time, making it impossible to tell what manner of creature might have
burrowed the tunnel.  A strong current tugs at you, pulling northward.

A Dwelling-Hole Above the Sea~
The oval-shaped cave entrance opens up into a good-sized, rectangular
chamber that has been carved straight back into the stone.  The walls and
floor are smooth, and have cupbaords and shelves carved into them.  Slender
hammocks hang toward the back of the chamber.  That is where the order of the
chamber ends--otherwise, the cave is an absolute mess.  Various nicknacks of
the nefortean residents are strewn all about, and the cavern is quite dirty,
with a thick layer of dust and cobwebs in the corners.

The Soothsayer\@s Cave~
The passageway opens into a large chamber with a vaulted ceiling.  All
along the walls are mystic runes and pictographs, but the dominant feature
is up on a long dais that runs for nearly half the length of the room--a red
sandstone altar.  At each corner of the altar, a pole rises up, topped with
a claw that holds some type of magic flame.  Flickering shadows dance along
the walls, and the scents of incense and blood are heavy in the air.

sign~
On an old wooden board, these line are written in a flowing script:
 
You cannot hide from future--
From fate you cannot flee--
But scrying makes the future clear--
Consult the bones, and see.
 
 
The soothsayer\@s eyes see clearly--
He\@ll make the hidden plain--
For 15000 golden coins
Foreknowledge you will gain.

The Side-Cave~
This small side-cave serves as a crude laboratory for the soothsayer.  A
long shelf lines the wall, filled with bottles that contain preserved body
parts, dried herbs, and strange liquids.  Jars and canisters hold a variety
of other substances.  There are minerals of all kinds, raw metal ores, and
other unfamiliar items.  A rough stone table sits in the center of the room,
and a small door leads northward.

A Dwelling-Hole Above the Sea~
The small cave you have entered serves as a nefortean home.  It goes
about twenty feet back into the stone, and widens past the narrow
oval-shaped entrance to at least as the same distance.  The residents of the
cave have left it in shambles--unwashed kitchenware is scattered on a low
stone table, a thick buildup of dust and refuse layer the floor, and
personal items are strewn about without rhyme or reason.

The Common Area~
The low ceiling of the common area is lined with a thin layer of smoke
from the nefortus\@ pipes.  There are several stone tables surrounded by old
wooden chairs throughout the room.  The main feature of the room is along
the southern wall--the ajikik board.

A Dwelling-Hole above the Sea~
This small cave houses a family of nefortu.  Past the oval-shaped
entrance leading to the sea-cavern, the cave widens out and continues back
into the stone.  Carved into the walls, shelves and cabinets hold the
various personal items of the family.  The only furniture, a frayed black
hammock that look very uncomfortable, hangs near the rear of the cave.

The Dwelling-Hole of the Shaman~
This cavern serves as the home for the air shaman of the Rahh-Nefor and
his eunuch attendents.  The cavern is roughly octogonal in shape, with walls
that are coated in a kind of grainy white paint.  The messiness and disorder
that pervades the other nefortean dwellings is present here--trash is strewn
about the floor, and from the putrid smell rising from it, it includes
rotting fish.

The Dwelling-Hole of the Shuddeni Ambassador~
The cavern entrance leads back into a long, rectangular chamber.  This
chamber, in contrast to those of the nefortu, is well-kept and in perfect
order.  It does contain the standard hammocks and other furniture.  There
are also a few sleeping mats on the ground.  This room houses quite a few
people.
