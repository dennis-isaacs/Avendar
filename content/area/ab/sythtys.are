A huge, pale alligator swims within the murky lake.
~
A pale, rough-skinned behemoth floats here, silently and menacingly.  Its
huge, jagged teeth, a rotting yellow, hang menacingly about its mouth,
digging down past its chubbed lips.  A pair of pus-lined pink eyes follow
every movement that stirs the water.  A vicious set of greyish-white claws
line its massive feet, twitching eagerly in the waters.  A huge tail floats
weightlessly behind it, a thick stem of muscle.

a veteran srryn hunter~
A muscular srryn crouches here, sharpening his axe.
~
A brutal-looking saurian, his scales have been dented and worn from
countless hunts deep into the wild depths of Sythtys.  His armor appears
natural, heaped together from sticks, leaves and mud, and offers him further
advantage of blending easier into his surroundings.

a mottled-green srryn patroller~
A mottled-green srryn wanders here, patrolling the swamps.
~
A human-sized, mottled-green scaled srryn prowls silently about the area,
keeping careful watch on its surroundings through a pair of bright
yellow-brown eyes.  Its snout is amass with scars, some deep and others
simple cuts, and nests a collection of sharpened brown-black teeth.  It
appears undisturbed by the dirtied leather armor worn about its body, and
moves a quick, calculated motion that suggests nimbleness in the strongest
sense.

A short, nimble srryn stands here, deftly scouting the area.
~
Hidden in the foliage, this small srryn keeps a careful watch on the
entrances and exits to Sythtys.  Dark-scaled and thin, its reflexes are
quick and nimble.  Scars cover its wiry body, though it does not seem to be
disturbed by them at all.

A muscular, brown-scaled srryn is here, moving swiftly through the foliage.
~
A large, bulky figure of mud-splattered brown scales, this srryn roams
through the swamps, hunting and scavenging through the vines and brush.  He
appears tall, in the prime of his life, with thick muscle and tight-gripping
hands adorned with sharp claws, slowly, eagerly, flexing.  A large tail
falls behind him, slowly dragging in the muddy grounds.

A huge, glistening black shape writhes within the muddy confines of the
cavern.  Its plated scales seem to glow in the dim light, dirtied only by
the dark mud that has caked over its shape.  Piercing amber eyes quickly
scan the room for prey, pausing from this only to lash out into the shadows
with its massive tail.  Its fangs are thin and sharp, and hang out of its
mouth in a threatening fashion.

His black scales darkened even more by soot, the srryn smith Senthofothen
stands amid the heavy smoke of the smithy.  His muscles bulge as he moves,
tightly-corded and powerful from years of forge-work.  A pair of
greenish-yellow black-slit eyes stare about coldly, offset by the dry heat
that surrounds this place.  His lower body, his legs, are encrusted with

Ssenkhatha~
A menacing, mottled-brown srryn crouches here, snarling viciously.
~
Ssenkhatha stands as a mass of tightly-corded muscle, bulging sickeningly
as he flexes through movement.  His scaled figure is huge, dominating, and
covered with scarring gashes, nicks and grazes.  A cruel, many-toothed maw
opens and closes, while a thin pinkish-black tongue flicks in and out
beckoningly, arrogantly.  His limbs are thick with strength, powerful and
sturdy.  A tail, beginning as thick as his waist and slimming to a simple
point, lashes out slowly behind him as a cruel, living whip.  

Achieving his strength through the dominance of his lessers, Ssenkhatha has
proven himself time and time again, and has so earned the respect, or at
least acknowledgement, of both his foes and fellow Elders.  His imposing
figure, so huge in proportion to the other srryn, is quite unnatural, his
muscle, speed and ability rumored to be passed to him from the immortal
Sythrak in a show of favor.

Thenseltha~
A tall, midnight-scaled srryn stands here, scouting his surroundings.
~
Thenseltha is a tall, dark-scaled srryn, appearing at least somewhat
muscular despite his wiry figure.  A pair of black-slit yellow eyes gaze
about cautiously.  His wiry look offers hints of unrivaled grace and
ability, which he puts further emphasis on with his every move, gesture and
work.  A toned middle extends down into two long, slender legs, balanced in
a careful stance.  A tail extends from behind him, wrapping itself around
his waist protectively, as if to avoid getting in the way.  

The Elder Rogue for quite a time, Thenseltha is known for his careful
plotting and vicious, calculated strikes.  Among the most deadliest of Elder
Rogues in recent history, his ability and cunning is unmatched by any under
him at this time, further securing his hold on the position.

ssithikka elder srryn slender jade-scaled~
Ssithikka~
A slender, jade-scaled srryn stands here, appearing eerily calm.
~
A slender figure plated with glistening jade scales, this srryn appears
at ease with her surroundings, and yet stanced in a most unusual offensive
fashion.  Her black-slit yellow eyes scan her surroundings lazily, seemingly
anticipating nothing, while her cruel maw is twisted in some wicked grin,
baring her well-kept razor sharp teeth.  She wears a darkened iron armor
over her well-built form, a most uncommon sight of metal in the murk of the
swamps, the dull surface decorated with scratched-out runes.  Behind her, a
thin, swift-moving tail flicks slowly in the air, appearing in every
interest to keep itself from the soiling muddy ground.  

Ssithikka is the wicked embodiment of the Thissa, the sect of Void Templars
of Sythtys, and the sole blood of the fallen Potentate Usthriykss.  It is
she who outlined and initiated the downfall of the templar Fensalthella and
stole the emptied position of Elder Templar for the serpent-marked members
of the Thissa, offering a new age to Sythtys.  Her influence on the magical
studies has been wide, with many turning from Fire to Void, seeking out the
wealth of power Ssithikka so preaches of, to be a part of the Thissa\@s dark
future.

A large, bulky srryn templar walks silently here, watching its surroundings.

Appearing clad in dark, tattered hides and bone fetishes, this imposing,
yet bulky, srryn templar patrols by the ruins of the Thissa Sept, the
smoldering husk that symbolized the first uprising of the Void in Sythtys. 
A pair of yellowish-green eyes stare out, glancing feverously at their
surroundings, and never settling on a single interest for but a moment.

A tall, fair-skinned human templar stands here, scouting the area.
~
A tall man with unsoiled, fair skin, Baelin stands on lookout by the
lowlands.  Assigned here by the Patrician alongside a small number of
soldiers to keep an eye on srryn activity in these parts, he makes careful
use of his time as he patrols this borderland, often found watching rather
than resting.  His body is well-built, a fitting look for a templar-soldier,
and he holds fast with his seemingly bulky armor, the grace of him evident
in his move.

Usthriykss~
Usthriykss, Potentate of the Thissa Sept, rests within the shadows.
~
Clad in black armor, Usthriykss stands amid the shadows of the hut.  His
unscarred black scales gleam in the faint light, which trickles in from the
cracks in the walls.  His eyes, a pale yellow, glance impassivly about his
surroundings.  Long, sharp claws protrude menacingly from his thick, black
hands.  The leader of the Thissa sept, he rules the small, obscure
collective with an iron grasp.

A black skeletal figure, Siyauz\@grak towers above the slick, wet bridge. 
Blood red eyes glow menacingly in their sockets, and his snout protrudes
grotesquely.  He reeks of rotting flesh, making the air about him hard to
breathe.  Bony hands extend at both sides of the bridge, tipped with
menacing black claws.  The hands swing widly, clawing at anything they
touch.  A dark cloud of blackness surrounds him, wisping into the air with
each sudden movement he makes.  A long tail of bone and rotting scales waves
from side to side behind him, occasionally rising to smash at the bridge.

Saithekan thin black-scaled srryn~
Saithekan~
A thin, black-scaled srryn rests within the clay hut.
~
Clad in burnt hides and tattered rags, Saithekan mindlessly wanders the
swamps.  His figure is thin and wiry, yet he seems oddly intimidating
nevertheless.  Once a Templar of old, his mind slowly slipped through
extended practice with the art of fire.  He was released from the Ysthael
sept for nearly obliterating an entire srryn army with a nova during a raid
against Earendam, and banished from the guild.  Now left to walk the swamps
without cause, he prefers not to interact with those around him, but keep to
his own thoughts.

a brown-scaled srryn guard~
A large, brown-scaled srryn guards the hallway within the Thissa Sept.
~
Covered in dark brown scales, this srryn guards the Thissa Sept with his
life.  A thick tail slinks behind him, twitching as he continues his patrol
of this section of the hall.  Strong and agile, he seems to be one of the
more aged of his race.

A wiry, emerald-scaled srryn crouches here, peering about intently.
~
A scrawny emerald-scaled thing, this srryn appears to have little muscle,
though his nimble body and small size more than make up for this.  His
movements are deft, and his gestures bubbling of ability.  A set of claws
glisten wickedly, sharpened to a vicious point.  His slim red-circled tail
extends behind him as a cruel lash, whipping heatedly in the air.

Rifsiyth~
A charcoal-scaled srryn stands here, flanked by fiery wings.
~
A hideous, dark-scaled srryn, this burn-ravaged thing is a spectacle of
bulging muscle and tormented flesh.  His face is seared by heat, which has
eaten away at the scales to reveal a white-patched underskin, streaked with
veins of blue and red.  A pair of glistening black-slit yellow eyes stare
about, rimmed with a pinkish-black tissue.  His chest heaves slowly, scarred
with cauterized gashes and impaled wounds.  A pair of arms, huge in
proportion to his body, bulge unnaturally, appearing filled with some wicked
strength.

A gigantic toad lays sprawled here, its young crawling over and under its skin.
~
A gigantic lump of slick, quivering flesh lies before you, barely
recognizable as a creature until its front is identified.  A toad of
horrific dimensions lies here.  A great pair of eyes loll about its
surroundings, a maw large enough to swallow a man whole underneath.  Its
sickly black-green flesh crawls with swarms of tiny young, both above and
below its skin 

Seeming to be immobile, the abberation gives the impression of basking in
some blasphemous power.

Garbed in wondrous, colorful robes, Galshivin would seem exotic
regardless of locale.  His shaven, noble look is offset only by his worn
leather boots, betraying the life of a traveler.  He carries with him a
heavy sack of goods, promising trinkets and treasures of unimagined origins.
His personal fame is quite extensive, and stories of his wares have traveled
to the far corners of Avendar.  His demeanor is one of good humor and
kindness, though the look in his eye and his odd, twisted grin suggest
something deeper than he would have you believe.

a greenish-brown srryn patroller~
A large srryn patrols silently, blending in with its surroundings.
~
A well-built saurian with goldish-brown eyes shifts slowly through its
patrol, keeping a wary watch on its enviroment.  Its body is thick with
obvious strength, as muscles bulge beneath its worn hide armors.  A long,
scratch-covered snout seems almost small in comparsion to the bulky tail
extending from behind the biped, which drags silently behind it.

His sentence was laid, and he now rests beneath the lake to rot in his
own curse by the Elders.  Yet, this is not so.  Before his curse, he was
enslaved by myself.  He now rests as the blood child of myself, forced to
obey my word.  His soul is so tainted by his actions, so reliant on the
negative energy fed to him by the Void...  He will enjoy resting in the
bloodflow of that energy, I would think.  The very lake he polluted will be
his life, and will serve his strength until he is summoned once more to do
my bidding.  Soon...  The very words spoken to summon, safe only to those of
my blood...

That fool!  Siyauz\@grak...  His strength and foolishness were his
downfall; attempting to demon summon at his limited knowledge.  I forbid
that when it was mentioned, and every time after.  Sh\@tiralk Lake is gone,
rotting in the Voids own curse.  However...  Perhaps there is a silver
lining.

The formation began soon after we returned into the deep swamps, further
from the warmblood worms.  Five, taken under my wing, learned the ways of
which I had been taught by Thiaj\@(unknown).  Quickly, they discovered the
ways of forcing negative energy from the Void plane and into our realm,
converting it from undirected power into a steady stream.  This was well. 
The six of us formed what is the Thissa sept, training our kin for use of
the void in battle.  One interests me, however.  Siyauz\@grak, his name is. 
He has talent in the Void, and has proven this.  This will be interesting,
teaching him.  Very interesting.

As the battle ravaged within the muddy confines of Sythtys, I watched. 
Hardly knowing, still learning.  Fire was thrown, and foes demolished. 
Blades met the colored scales, and the Srryn fell.  Pain wracked every point
of their bodies, and yet I felt nothing.  They did not know.  And so I
touched the murky blackness, wielding it as shown to me by Thiaj\@(unknown). 
Every black word that slipped from my forked tongue, every delicate gesture
of my black-scaled hands.  They were mine, and mine only.  With one massive
burst of negative energy, 20 men were obliterated where they stood.  The
rest halted combat, fear driving through their hearts like a hot iron spike.
Even my precious srryn stood motionless, watching me.  Licking my lips, I
snarled softly.  These very warmbloods dared to tresspass on our grounds,
unknowing of our power.  They would not live.  Not one.  And so we advanced.

the pitch-black iron sword, \#Blight\#~
A pitch-black iron sword rests here, inscribed with demonic runes.~
Forged in Sythtys, \#Blight\# is perhaps the archetype of modern srryn
craftsmanship.  However, its transition into its current form is marked by
the emergence of the then-burgeoning Thissa Sept.  The first leaders of the
Thissa marked the blade with its fell markings, and as Zyal before them,
nourished its growing hunger with the lives of countless warmbloods and
other, lesser srryn.  After the blade reached substantial enough power, the
Thissa were able to use it, in conjuction with more conventional methods of
the void study, to establish themselves beyond the machinations of the
Ysthael and traditional Sept.  As for the weapon itself, its corrosive power
and intense lust for blood have elevated it to a near-peerless tool of
destruction.

A Crude Stick Hut~
This short stick hut sits amidst a mass of slick swamp foliage, visible
through the many holes in the crude-crafted walls.  The air inside the hut
is smoky, and fresh with the smell of recently-caught game.  Little detail,
if any, was put into the creation of this structure, and it looks to simply
have been thrown together in a rush.  While it appears sturdy enough to
dwell in, it does not appear as if it could withstand even a weak storm.  A
single exit to the south offers passage back out into the greenish-brown
fields of the murky swamp.

The Edge of the Lowlands~
The northern grasslands slowly come into these wet-ground lowlands, which
border the swamps.  A light mist flows about the ground beneath you, and
lingers between the damp leaves of the ferns and mottled plantlife that
begin to grow \@round this area.  A marker has been set on a nearby stump; a
single band of berry-dyed leather that appears to be nailed down.  Further
to the south, the ground becomes thick with a vile brown mud as the lowlands
shift into swamplands.  To the north, the grasslands spread out.

An Outside Smithy~
A thick cloud of smoke hangs in the air, slowly floating off into the
open.  This smithy is based in a small man-made clearing, with the
surrounding plantlife trampled and soot-covered.  In the center of the
clearing, a massive iron anvil, a rare metal in the murk of the swamp, sits,
with crudely-made buckets partially filled with water and half-worked pieces
scattered about around it.  A number of dented armors lie in a pile near the
anvil, crested some bruised mark; they appear to be the source of the
smithy\@s metal, a bent mess of iron scavenged from corpses.  The area
appears to be oddly dry, lacking the natural wetness of the swamp.

A Muddy Swamp~
As the northern lowlands descends into the swamp, the area grows darker
and murkier.  A thick brown mud rests upon the ground, spotted with various
print that suggest the presence of a bipedal species nearby.  A light mist
flows through the area, bringing a weak stench about the swamp.  Ferns and
other plantlife rise around the muddy trail, kept alive only by the small
amount of light peeking through the twisted-bark trees that rise up around
you.  The swamps extend to the south, east and west.  To the north, the
lowlands connect the swamps to the Earendam Grasslands.  A tightly-braided
length of hide dangles down from a nearby tree, in line with a number of
carved foot-holds in the surface that offer firm purchase for climbing.

A Path Through The Vines~
Dark green vines surround your entrance, flowing and wrapping around each
other.  Bunched together above you, they provide sunlight no entrance into
their domain.  Caked mud rests upon the vines, the rare thorn thrusting
itself through the wet dirt in a menacing fashion.  Mist flows through the
vines, the odor of rot becoming stronger.  On the ground, thick mud
continues to flow along east with the hidden trail.

species.  The water appears almost as greenish-brown as the plantlife
itself, which rises up around you in a seemingly unchanging display, broken

from the trees.  The air grows thick with a warm, heavy stench, barely
tolerable, to the east, while to the south, west and north, the swamp
continues into drier regions.

The lake is a sickly dark green, faint shadows of underwater life visible

reaching down, almost touching the surface.  Decaying wood floats along the
lake, the slight breeze edging it along the water.  To the west, the lake
ends at a muddy trail.

On a Murky Lake~
This lake is tinted a sickly green, and spreads out before you as a
rippling, shadow-filled soup of drifting plantlife.  A thin mist hangs over
the water, clouding your view of the surroundings.  Bits and pieces of slick
wood float about the lake\@s surface.  The air is heated here, moreso than
the swamps that border the lake, and carries a weak, yet unappealing,
stench.  The shore of the lake consists of a thick growth of plantlife,
which rises up to block exit in that direction.

Inside a Warm Leather Tent~
A certain warmness seems to flow through the leather tent, and the smell
of grass that seems to drift from the freshly woven mats covering the ground
provide a relaxing feeling.  Lanterns are set along the sides, casting a
bright light upon the contents of the hut.  In the northwest corner, a
freshwater spring spills into a polished ivory bowl.  A bedroll is set
against the western side of the tent, and covered with comfortable looking
wool sheets.  An oaken chest is set nearby the bedroll, with the crest of
Earendam carved onto its top.

The Remains of a Crude Hut~
You stand in the burnt out remains of a crude stick hut.  The swamp,
however, is slow to reclaim the untended dwelling.  Very little grows within
the hut as if the plants eschew the earth about it.  A pall of darkness
seems to hang about what remains of the walls of the hut, and an undefinable
coldness exists here, an unsettling contrast to the sweltering heat of the
swamp.

A canopy of lurid, flowering vines can be seen through the roof, where a
large section has collapsed, the debri covering part of the stone-paved
floor. To the south, part of the wall has caved in, revealing a passage
through the mottled brown thicket into the swamps beyond.

A Dark Swamp~
The surrounding foliage is unnaturally dense, and hangs all around you;
mottled-green ferns droop onto what could be called a trail, as noted by the
various bipedal footprints that have worn the mud down.  Above you, branches
hang down, heavy with leaves, vines and hole-riddled blankets of soft green.
Only small streams of light manage to find their way into this heated cage,
which is slick with a crystal-clear dew.  To the north, a large crack in a
fallen tree allows passage.

A Crude, Smoke-Filled Shrine~
A thick black smoke swirls in the warm air around you, wafting up from a
dark-burning firepit in the center of this dark place.  Broken and
soot-covered bones are scattered about, fashioned with rough bark and vine
into fetishes, mixing in with fragrant dried herbs and fiery-red flowers
that pepper the ground.  Behind the soft-crackling firepit, rising up into
the air, is a dull, mud-speckled stone statue of a great saurian, cracked
and covered with thick vines that wrap around the dark wood in a strangling
hold.  Around you, the thick plantlife rises up in all directions,
effectively barring sight and movement through.  

At the base of the stone statue, a dried circle of hardened black earth is
surrounded by rune-scored rocks.  In the very center of the circle, a
deeply-dug hole sits idle, almost as if it were waiting to be filled.

rather a frozen form of a living being.  A long cloak drapes over broad
shoulders, and falls evenly to the knees.  The only hint of color beams from
deep under the hood, in what appear to be the most intense, flaming, yellow
eyes you have ever seen.  Sharp, jagged teeth can be seen when focused on
through the shadows of the hood.  His stout, bare chest reveals a number of
deep scars, gained from a lifetime a battle in his time.  Each break in
armor reveals defined, bulgy muscles shaped with unparalleled strength.  

A break is made in this magestic frame, as you realize that there is a large
hole penetrating through his skull.  An inscription at the base of the
statue reads: Here is Sskilgar, once Dreadlord, forever failure of Sythrak.

A Murky Swamp~
All around you, the swamp extends as a field of greenish-brown, marked by
only some minor difference; the brownish-grey mud, heavily-marked and patted
down by the travel of what appears to be a bipedal species, appears in sharp
contrast to the vibrant orange-violet colors of the flower and herb-speckled
bushes and trees.  Trees, with twisted-bark surfaces, rise up around you,
with odd-shaped branches dangling vines and other fallen plantlife over the
area.  To the south and east, a thick mass of thorned vines rise up,
blocking passage in those directions.

A Partially-Collapsed Tunnel~
A narrow tunnel leads down through the earth, the slick, muddy walls held
at bay by a framework of heavy, swampwood struts.  Despite these
crudely-engineered supports, the tunnel is in the process of collapse, with
great slabs of mud sliding from the roof and walls to the floor.  Directly
above, the tunnel rises to a trapdoor, while ahead, the tunnel bends away

A thin, putrid mist surrounds this side-path, covering the foliage in a

black-watered lake rests quietly.

dwell in, it does not appear as if it could withstand even a weak storm.  

A collection of lumped-together pieces of bark-heavy swampwood rest in the
corner of the hut, acting as a holding place for the crude \@jars\@ of dried,
wrapped leaves and thick vines that hold various herbs, mud-pastes and
ground bones.  A firepit is dug into the wet ground in the center of the
hut, surrounded by a thick border of thin, black-speckled bones.  To the

A Flooded Laboratory~
Algae and slime-molds hang from the swampwood rafters in slick, green
veils, and drape the muddy walls in putrid tapestries.  Water fills the
chamber to knee-height; a brackish, oily fluid which seems to ripple in
response to unseen movement.  Scattered about the chamber, in many places
half-submerged, are various pieces of medical apparatus.  Black-stained
gorgets and trepanning tools protrude from the water at odd angles,
alongside bloodied forceps, bone saws and scalpels, all rusting away.  In
the center of the chamber is an examination table, bearing a large skeleton.

A heavy-lintelled doorway leads to the east, while a hole in the roof leads
to a muddy tunnel.

table~
A large, humanoid skeleton, possibly that of an alatharya, lies on the
examination table in the center of the room.  Its flesh has been thoroughly
consumed by the seething life of the swamp, although now the bones are
draped with sheaths of clinging algae.  The skeleton seems relatively
undamaged, as though its owner had escaped the most brutal ministrations of

The table itself is formed from a lopsided tressel of hardwood, its rusty
iron legs slowly sinking into the muddy floor.  Its surface has been gouged
with deep, black-stained runnels, which seem designed to channel fluids
along the surface to a hole at the patient\@s feet.  A ceramic bowl hangs

skeleton~
A large, humanoid skeleton, possibly that of an alatharya, lies on the
examination table in the center of the room.  Its flesh has been thoroughly
consumed by the seething life of the swamp, although now the bones are
draped with sheaths of clinging algae.  The skeleton seems relatively
undamaged, as though its owner had escaped the most brutal ministrations of
this laboratory\@s former masters.

A Crude Stone Chamber~
This low chamber has been crudely carved out of a great mass of granite
beneath the surface of the swamp.  The walls here are still slick with
algae, but the rough floor is only puddled, being a couple of feet higher
than that of the eastern room.  The only furnishings are a ring of rusted
iron braziers around the walls and a toppled, wooden lectern at the far end
of the room.

symbolvision~
As you study the infernal script of the inscription, you feel your
consiousness wane and a sense of drowsiness wash over you.  

You suddenly jerk back to your senses, floating amidst an alien dreamscape. 
All at once your surroundings are both familiar and unknown.  Shapes and
memories float about you, voices- both known and mysterious- echo about from
every corner.  You find yourself flying through it with a feeling of calm
wonderment.  

You continue to travel deeper into the dream and begin to note that your
surroundings have taken a darker cast.  Faces seem twisted and mocking while
places you once knew are now dark and tainted.  As you try to puzzle out the
meaning of these dark visions, a chill runs unbidden down your spine.  

You feel your essence suddenly snatched elsewhere, the visions of the dream
blurring with travel.  Sensation quickly returns as you feel yourself fall
roughly onto stony ground.  

You stagger to your feet trying to identify the nightmare before you.  Walls
of jagged red-black stone rise in the horizon and the air holds an acrid
quality.  You try and take to the skies again, to return to your dreams, but
you realize with blood-freezing certainty you cannot.  

Dark, reptilian shapes begin to dart from the shadows at the corners of your
vision, gone as you turn to look.  You\@re granted precious little time to
ponder this as you feel scaled hands grasping your arms, seizing you.  Your
panicked gaze meets the slitted pupils of scaled and toothed horrors,
grinning hungrily even as you struggle in vain.  

Another demon steps from the shadows, raising a claw to strike.  You feel
the razor-tipped digits dig deep into the soft flesh of your underbelly, and
watch in pain-wracked horror as your intestines are drawn out.  You sag in
the grasp of the demons, blood running as a torrent from the gash, trying
desperately to awake.  

You are suddenly again within the cave, the crest of Chaigidon seared into
your mind.

A Murky Swamp~
All around you, the swamp extends as a field of greenish-brown, marked by
only some minor difference; the brownish-grey mud, heavily-marked and patted
down by the travel of what appears to be a bipedal species, appears in sharp
contrast to the vibrant orange-violet colors of the flower and herb-speckled
bushes and trees.  Trees, with twisted-bark surfaces, rise up around you,
with odd-shaped branches dangling vines and other fallen plantlife over the

have been thrown together in a rush.  While it appears sturdy enough to
dwell in, it does not appear as if it could withstand even a weak storm.

A Wet Swamp~
The muddy ground below you is streaked with veins of water, draining into
the numerous prints sunk into the mud.  Of The water appears almost as
greenish-brown as the plantlife itself, which rises up around you in a
seemingly unchanging display, broken only by the noticable appearance of
large orange-violet flowers that grow from the trees.  A clearing in the
swamp opens up to the north, surrounded by crude stick huts.

Amidst a Collection of Huts~
Around you, the slick foliage is broken apart to reveal a number of
crude-fashioned huts set on the grounds of this wet swamp.  The muddy ground
is covered and hard-pressed with the footprints of numerous bipeds, and the
faint sounds in the air do further to suggest a nearby presence.  The warm
air around you carries the musky scent of smoke.  Around you, the wet swamp
continues, with entrances to nearby huts visible through the lingering
plantlife to the north and west.

A Crude Stick Hut~
This short stick hut sits amidst a mass of slick swamp foliage, visible
through the many holes in the crude-crafted walls.  The air inside the hut
is smoky, and fresh with the smell of recently-caught game.  Little detail,
if any, was put into the creation of this structure, and it looks to simply
have been thrown together in a rush.  While it appears sturdy enough to
dwell in, it does not appear as if it could withstand even a weak storm.

of the hut, kept company by the half-eaten limbs and chest-parts of some
poorly-cooked beast.  To the south, a hole in the hut leads back out into

A Dark Trail~
A thin, putrid mist surrounds the beginnings of this side-path, covering
the foliage in a pale blanket.  The blackish-gray mud holds few tracks, if
any, along its progress in covering the ground, suggesting this as a rarely
travelled route.  A thick plantlife rises up through most of the way,
hindering movement greatly.  The air appears more wet here, carrying with it
a stench most unbearable that appears to be wafting in from the southeast.

The Muddy Shore of a Black Lake~
A thick foliage rises up around this shrouded, black-watered lake,
keeping it well-obscured from sight.  The shadows amass here, their darkness
magnified by the unnatural coldness that bites through the air, a grim
difference from the natural sweltering heat of the swamps.  The heavy growth
of plantlife surrounding the small lake is riddled with black splotches,
tainted by something, yet undying in this chill-touched place.  The
shoreline, a murky mess of blackish-gray, disappears into the dark waters,
in whose depths stretch unknown.

The eerily still waters of the lake barely wave as they come against this

thickens enough to hinder passage in those directions.  The water-veined mud

The northern grasslands slowly come into these wet-ground lowlands, which
border the swamps.  A light mist flows about the ground beneath you, and

All around you, the swamp extends as a field of greenish-brown, marked by

down by the travel of what appears to be a bipedal species, appears in sharp
contrast to the vibrant orange-violet colors of the flower and herb-speckled
