wight undead prisoner~
a wight~
The wight of a former prisoner crouches here, snarling.
~
A crouched humanoid figure with slimy white skin and sharp, protruding
teeth, this wight is what remains of one of the castle\@s former prisoners. 
Its mouth is twisted into a permanent snarl, as it tears at the ancient
manacles bound to its deathly wrists.

chotha death knight~
Chotha the Death Knight~
The black-boned lich, Chotha, lingers in the castle.
~
Chotha is an unwholesome and shadowy figure, his yellow and black bones
rigid and cracked.  Rotting cords of sinew hang from his animate corpse,
dust accumulating within the open maw of his abdomen.  In life, he was a
eunuch from Ashta Harrud, who came to the kingdom as part of an agreement
between the two nation-states.  His prowess in battle was exceptional, and
he came to serve Raspal as a Death Knight.  He is famed for his skill with a
scimitar, and is said to have slaughtered the families of those who spoke
out against the king.

yshag death knight~
Yshag the Death Knight~
Lord Yshag moves slowly about, half of his skull missing.
~
Lord Yshag is a monstrous, hulking lich whose body has been slowly
rotting from his black bones.  Half of his skull is missing and empty, the
dim light of the castle filtering through his open eye socket.  Some claimed
he was a barbarian from the outlands, said to worship a blood-mad goddess. 
He was first an unofficial enforcer, but with the ascendance of the Death
Knights, he was hand-picked to serve among them.  He is known for the
gigantic claymore he wielded while living, and the many acts of butchery he
committed with it.

bashra death knight~
Bashra the Death Knight~
The feral lich, Lord Bashra, seeks his next prey.
~
Lord Bashra is a surprisingly sleek and feral-looking skeleton, blackened
skin clinging to his decaying body.  He is hunched forward, predatory, with
long wisps of hair trailing down his back.  He was among Gogoth\@s best
horsemen, and was called upon to serve the Death Knights early on.  He was
trained to wield the axe, which was his weapon of choice when terrorizing
the townsfolk and the countryside.  He is said to have burned farms who
harbored opposition to the king or helped their fearful countrymen to escape
the country during its last years.

chtagn death knight~
Chtagn the Death Knight~
Lord Chtagn, a wiry and skeletal Death Knight, is here.
~
Lord Chtagn is a wiry and skeletal lich, his dry, black skin stretched
tight and lined with ancient scars.  His chest bears a particularly
gruesome-looking wound, with splintered ribs protuding from it.  In life, he
was said to be a follower of the White Falcon, expressing his murderous
nature in a series of lethal duels.  He slew so many foes under the auspices
of friendly battle that he was hated throughout the kingdom.  His reputation
won him an audience with Raspal, and after his defeat, was forced to put his
scythe to work for the nation\@s Death Knights.

Iichal the Death Knight~
A short, stocky lich, Iichal, looms here.
~
Iichal is short and stocky, his skin and muscle slow to fully decay. 
What skin remains is covered with horrific gashes, which leak black ichor
down along his thick, sticky legs.  He was famous in Gogoth for his exploits
against the hill giants, which made him a hero to the people of the
Brintors.  Yet, those who knew him knew that this veneer did not conceal his
sadism, malice, and cruelty.  He is said to have tortured men, women and
children who were imprisoned in the castle dungeon, and aided the lich
prince in his many diabolic experiments.

Kthrrar the Death Knight~
Kthrrar, the undead kankoran abomination, lurches by.
~
Lord Kthrrar was one of the rare kankoran to find favor in the court of
King Rasadal Gogoth VII.  Even his terrible lich form is imposing, the
withering skin covered in crumbling fur.  It is said that he came to the
kingdom of Gogoth after the collapse of the Republic.  His ferocity and
cruelty struck the fancy of Raspal, the king\@s brother, and he was inducted
into the country\@s Death Knights.  He was known for cutting out the tongues
of human prisoners and eating them in a grisly spectacle.  Ever hungering
for battle, he still seeks the taste of blood.

Skashai the Death Knight~
The tall skeleton of Lord Skashai lurks within the hall.
~
Lord Skashai is hardly more than a skeleton, covered only by a
translucent film of skin.  He is tall, but stalks with a hunch throughout
Castle Gogoth.  He was considered a nobleman of honor during his life, and
well known for his association with the foreign aelin city of Ilodaiya. 
According to legend, he made a pact with Raspal to allow his son to leave
the city.  Raspal agreed, but only on the condition that Skashai renounce
his faith and become a Death Knight.  His crumbling body dwells forever in
the service of the lich king, feasting upon the living.

Khavha is an imperious skeletal shuddeni, his posture oddly rigid despite
his death.  His body appears to have been burned extensively, with only bits
of his charred flesh remaining upon his eyeless skull.  During the kingdom\@s
final years, he served Raspal and the Death Knights as overseer of the
city\@s criminal code.  His imposition of a strict curfew led to many brutal
deaths, imprisonments, and torture.  His frightful tyranny touched the lives
of all who lived in Gogoth, and he was widely feared for his extreme
attitude and overwhelming use of force.

varshag death knight~
Varshag the Death Knight~
The foul-smelling atrocity, Lord Varshag, languishes here.
~
Lord Varshag is a foul smelling atrocity whose bent neck leans his
blackened skull to the left.  The upper half of his body has been burned,
the singed flesh and darkened bone reeking of decay.  In life, he was a
ruthless noble who commanded the loyalty of much of the court with his
devious plotting and physical acumen.  According to legend, he attempted to
seduce Queen Wythea in an abortive attempt to murder the king and claim the
throne for himself.  For his folly, he was lashed to the chapel altar and
lit on fire, his violent agony a reminder of the price of betrayal.

Krothin the Death Knight~
Lord Krothin is here, a shambling horror of decaying flesh.
~
Lord Krothin is a shambling, animate horror of sharp, black bones and
decaying flesh.  Many of his teeth are missing, and what few remain are
jagged and broken.  As a youth, he caught the eye of Princess Bhara, who
facilitated a rapid ascent from his common birth to lordship.  His skill
with the polearm was immense, and needed little convincing to join Raspal\@s
death knights.  After the princess tired of him, he grew ever more bitter,
hateful, and finally, murderous.  Legends say that when he spoke ill of
Bhara, Raspal struck him in the face with a marble bust.

Xamon the Death Knight~
Xamon, a frail-looking Death Knight with one arm, is here.
~
Xamon is a frail-looking lich with one of its arms missing.  A patchwork
of ancient, rotting stitches cross what remains of its body, with ribs
piercing through the filmy skin.  A masochist in life, he enjoyed being the
subject of a variety of ritual tortures.  This penchant allowed him to not
only survive, but enjoy, a lengthy study among the shuddeni.  Upon his
return to Gogoth, many believed he was having an affair with a fellow Death
Knight, Naggush the fallen.  It is said that he witnessed Naggush\@s
beheading, and severed his own arm later that night.

Chulru the Death Knight~
The slimy, rotting lich of Lord Chulru is here.
~
Lord Chulru\@s animate remains rival the terror he instilled in life.  His
skeletal shoulders are broad, and much of his body remains withered, slimy,
and unrotted.  He was considered a master of all weapons, having proven
himself in arenas throughout the Republic and the underworld.  Born in
Gogoth, his many victories and spectacular bloodlust made him a hand-picked
choice of Prince Raspal.  His lordship was both swift and shocking given his
reputation as a showman.  He was given a great skull-shaped mace after
killing six fleeing deserters with his bare hands.

Naggush is a particularly wretched creature, his head entirely missing. 
The rest of his decaying body moves with a disturbing, animalistic gait,
claw-like bones splitting the skin of his fingers.  He is said to have
served as a priest of Jolinn, before he sold his soul to be with the woman
he loved.  When he lost her, he joined the Death Knights to regain a purpose
in life.  He is rumored to have had a torrid affair with his fellow Knight,
Xamon the masochist.  Naggush was beheaded three nights before the kingdom\@s
collapse while Xamon watched.

Lord Blathsa is a nightmare of a creature, with black spikes protruding
from much of his body.  His eye sockets are empty, with red ichor rolling
from them down the length of his skeletal frame.  Captain of the Death
Knights, he was the right hand of Prince Raspal, and the king\@s military
advisor.  He is said to have led many successful campaigns before the curse
fell upon the kingdom, and was considered a relentless and brilliant
tactician.  It is said that his spiked staff was a gift from the king
himself, as a sign of his meritorious service.

Vrathis the Death Knight~
The withered, skeletal form of Lord Vrathis is here.
~
Lord Vrathis is a slender skeleton, his body withered from the weight of
untold ages.  His jaw hangs crookedly from his blackened skull, his stature
uneven due to a weak knee.  During his early life, he was renowned
throughout the kingdom as a remarkable warrior-poet.  At the prime of his
life, he was driven insane by the sudden and unexpected death of his beloved
wife.  His madness drove him to murder, torture, and hatred, and at the
beckoning of Raspal, became anointed as a Death Knight.  His dark lusts and
murderous bent live on in the form of a lich.

Wythea the Lich Queen~
The wretched, bent skeleton of Wythea the Lich Queen is here.
~
Wythea, Queen of Gogoth, is little more than a wretched and bent
skeleton.  Her once delicate fingers are black and broken, and her
nightmarish face drips with black ichor.  While living, she was renowned for
her magnificent beauty and notorious for her cruelty.  Legends say that
those who displeased her were skinned alive, and that her special hatred was
reserved for young women.  Her appetites were vast and unrestrained, leading
to multiple affairs which scandalized the kingdom.  Her lich lingers within
the castle, a permanent testament to her many evils.

bhara princess lich~
Bhara the Lich Princess~
Bhara the Lich Princess lingers here, chest torn open.
~
The animate corpse of Princess Bhara is a petite exercise in horror.  Her
expression is frozen in a tormented scream, her cheeks long having hollowed
and her eyes rotted out.  She moves with a feverish, unnatural speed, her
decaying chest split open to reveal a heartless void.  In life, she was
known both for her beauty and her lack of restraint.  Palace servants
considered her a malicious hell-cat and suffered under her cruelty.  Her
viciousness is eternally preserved in this ghastly form, with no charm left
to conceal her torturous whims.

Raspal the Lich Prince~
The hulking, skeletal form of Raspal stands here.
~
The king\@s brother, Raspal, is a hulking skeletal warrior, the tatters of
his skin hanging from his black bones.  His presence is imposing despite his
ancient death, his rotting muscle still possessing quite a bit of strength. 
During his life, he was among Gogoth\@s most famous warriors, and is said to
have both taught and commanded Gogoth\@s infamous Death Knights.  The
animosity between he and the king over Princess Bhara was well-known, and
the flame of his hatred burns within him.  He battles all who still live,
sharing his suffering with those who enter his domain.

Shaia the Lich Princess~
The nightmarish Princess Shaia waits upon her rotting bed.
~
The withered form of Shaia, the Queen\@s sister, is a nightmare of bone
and rot.  Her once-curves are long stripped of their charms, with blackened
bone protruding through the leathery remains of her skin.  Once a ruthless
and sensual manipulator, she was reputed to have seduced many within
Gogoth\@s court.  As well, it was rumored that she was having an affair with
the king during the collapse of his domain.  She waits on the rotting
remains of her bed in a sad mockery of seduction, her ravenous hunger
driving her to feast upon the agony of the living.

Icyuth the Death Knight~
The slight, dexterious lich, Lord Icyuth, is here.
~
Lord Icyuth is a shockingly dexterious lich who sticks to the shadows of
Castle Gogoth.  His body is withered but largely whole, save for a massive
gash down his left side, from which the rotting remains of his entrails
hang.  He was one of Gogoth\@s most well-known aristocrat, whose celebrity
largely centered on his daring feats of acrobatics.  He was forced to choose
between death, or becoming a Death Knight, after he was caught having an
affair with Princess Shaia.  In undeath, he plies his deadly skill against
any living foe who enters the castle.

bahtan lich prince~
Bahtan the Lich Prince~
The adolescent corpse of Bahtan the Lich Prince is here.
~
Bahtan, heir to the black throne of Gogoth, is a fearful adolescent
corpse.  The handsomeness of youth has long left him, much of his face
having rotted to expose black teeth and a fractured skull.  His chest has
nearly collapsed in upon itself, the ragged remains of his skin barely
concealing the injuries which took his life.  During his short lifetime,
Bahtan was hailed as a prodigy of the highest order, as well as a heartless
killer.  His grotesque experimentation on living prisoners filled the castle
with screams, and savors the sound, even in death.

A lich guard stands here, guarding the court of Gogoth.
~
Formerly a member of the King\@s elite personal guards, this warrior is
now a horrifying lich.  Still bearing its ancient weapons and skull- crested
armor, he patrols the crumbling court of Gogoth, seeking to slay whatever
intruders might dare approach his deathless master.

Ksathan the Lich Priest~
Ksathan the Lich Priest waits here, a horror of fire and bone.
~
The lich priest, Ksathan, is a horror of fire and bone.  Clad in the
blackened, tattered garb of a holy man, his fleshless face is lit from
within by two blazing eyes.  According to legend, it was he who first set
the king upon the path to destruction, and he who conducted the first of
many blasphemous rites.  Tales of the fearful rituals performed in the
chapel terrorized the city of Gogoth, and struck fear into the hearts of the
king\@s enemies.  His animate remains dwell in the court of his king forever,
his tongue missing and jaw shattered.

Gogoth the Lich King~
The Lich King Gogoth sits deathless upon his eternal throne.
~
King Rasadal Gogoth VII, the final monarch of the kingdom of Gogoth and
the grasslands of Shargob, is a towering skeleton clad in a rotting purple
robe.  His withered flesh is grey and tight, with long grey hair hanging
limply from his head.  Unholy power crackles through his skeletal frame, his
empty eye sockets burning with malevolent red light.  It is said that he
sought the secrets of the Demon God, Xiginath, in his mad quest for eternal
life.  From his black throne, he presides forever over his undead kingdom.

Grathen, captain of the guard, stands over ten feet tall, his massive
skeleton thick with rotting slabs of muscle.  From his stature it is obvious
that he was an alatharya in life, but the curse of Gogoth has transformed
him into a fearful undead monstrosity.  It is said that he served the king
faithfully for twenty years as his personal bodyguard, and attempted to
defend his master\@s honor until the bitter end.  In death, he continues to
serve, maintaining a solemn vigil within the court.

A long, billowing shade of deep, poisonous green hovers here, the

figure.  A pair of scabrous, transparent hands protrude from under the
cloak, twisted and clawed.  The face cannot be seen, concealed by the folds
of the cowl.  Some unfelt breeze stirs the wraith\@s garment, insubstantial
cloth filling and swaying silently.  A weird, unearthly illumination
flickers from within the wraith, filling the area with inconstant, ghostly
green light.

The undead cupbearer stands here, absently plucking at its putrid flesh.
~
Unlike most undead creatures, this one appears to some degree aware of
the decay of its body.  It occasionally makes neurotic plucking motions at
its torso, tearing away strips of rotten flesh with its black, clawlike
fingernails.  Its tattered garments were one those of a cupbearer, an
occupation further attested to by its small stature, closer to that of an
adolescent human.  Occasionally, it forces a tonal whining noise through its
shredded, rotten lips, perhaps in an attempt to sing for its master.

writing desk~
This large writing desk was once of exquisite make, carved from some rare
or exotic wood.  The years have not been kind, blackening, staining, and
weakening it with decay.  Despite this, it has a still-functional drawer
which hangs slightly open.  On the top of the desk, an open book waits, the
writing of the final pages still legible.

open book~
The thick book sits on the desk, open to a hand-written page.  It reads: 

Tonight I will at last invoke the Great Conjuration.  Father Ksathan
continues his attempts to dissuade me, may the devils curse his false piety.
I believe I will have his tongue cut out, and force him to witness my final
steps into the Powers of Immortality.  Nothing can go wrong!  Have I not
learned the secrets of the Demon Lord Xiganath?  Have I not discerned the
cause of Iopasi\@s ancient failure in the greater rituals?  

This very day, I have called the Handmaidens.  I ground the bones of several
city urchins with mortar and pestle, and inscribed the Tetragon.  For fuel,
I used the corpse of Sir Alre, an itinerant spirit templar who took too much
of an interest in the special religious services I held in the chapel.  

My wife blanched when I cut the heart out of our daughter Bhara.  Her blood
mingled with the salt on the floor, again the Tetragon, this time in
preparation for the Tree.  How could Wythea object when the fruit it will
bear will let us taste of life undying?  Is not any price worth it?  Has she
not read?  

It is written in the Dark Tome, \#And he who may successfully conjure the
Last of these Conjurations, shall never lie in the grave, and the power of
the Death God will run through him.\#  Such exultation to know that it is I
this prophet spoke of!  I go now to make ready my final preparations.  When
next I sit at this desk, deathless will I be.

Inside the Palace Gates~
Inside the massive black palace gates, a spacious entry hall looms.  Once
an imposing sight, the upper reaches of the hall are lost in darkness. 
Centuries-old torches sit in rusty brackets lining the walls, and molding
tapestries lie in fetid heaps.  The stench of death dominates the palace,
and evil seems to radiate from within.  The entry hall leads north into the
palace, and the gates open to the south.

The Ancient Armory~
The back of the armory has completely collapsed, with the castle\@s outer
wall having mostly broken down into it.  Much of the floor is entirely
buried by shattered stone, the hole in the wall not quite large enough to
fit through.  A cold, sickening wind blows in from the plains of Shargob,
sending the dust of the chamber swirling about.  Broken metal plates are
strewn throughout, the only concession to the armory\@s original purpose.

A short hallway connects the grand entrance hall of Castle Gogoth to the

adorned with exotic tapestries, which have long since rotted into
unidentifiable rags.  A suit of toppled armor is scattered across the floor;
another set, still standing, is on the opposite side of the hall.  The floor
is covered in mouldering, blackened carpet, covered by dust and debris, and

The standing suit of armor is still recognizable, although corroded
beyond repair.  It is rumored to have belonged to King Xerkas Gogoth, who
declared the neutrality of the kingdom during the invasion of its northern
neighbor, Caal, during the War of Fire.  According to legend, it was he who
first brought the study of Fire magic to Gogoth, and it would become a
defining factor of its history until the kingdom\@s collapse.  The armor
bears a series of indentations where golden crests were once inlaid, but
they have long since been pried free and stolen.

The toppled set of armor is forged from black iron and marked with the

Its buckles and straps are rotted through or broken, and its crumbling

This dungeon cell is as tiny as it is revolting, the stone walled smeared
with ancient blood, slime, and excrement.  Filth coats the floor in a film
of thick, gelatinous slime, making each breath of the heavy air almost
unbearable.  Rusted iron manacles and heavy, broken chains hang limply from
the walls.  There are no windows, only the corroded bars and the long
collapsed door to give any possible escape from the gloom.  To the east is
the corridor which traverses the dungeon.

The Foul Dungeon~
This cramped corridor runs north and south between two rows of cells. 
The barred iron doors have fallen free of their hinges, long ago rendered
useless by corrosion.  The floor is covered by debris and ancient filth, a
mixture of blood, offal and slime.  Ancient torch mountings have come loose
from the stone walls, twisted and empty, and foul grime darkens every
surface.  The air is putrid, a mixture of the reek of excrement and death. 
To the east and west are ancient prison cells, while the corridor through
the dungeon continues north and south.

The Rotting Palace Stairway~
These wood-lined, rotting steps lead up from the palace\@s entry hall
toward the great feasting hall.  An arched entryway leads south into it,
with a huge rendition of Gogoth\@s skull-crest set into the ancient tiles. 
The door to the hall is long missing, its broken hinges sticking out visibly
from one side.  The rich carpet that once covered the stairs is long-rotted,
its deep crimson darkened into a tattered black.  The stairway continues
upward toward a higher level of the castle, and downward toward the entry
hall.

The walls of this corner of the feasting hall are dominated by great
maps, showing much of the known world.  The debris of collapsed tables are
interspersed with torn, crumbling parchment, its meaning long lost to the
march of years.  The stone walls, where visible, are stained by sprays of
blood or ancient grime.  One of the chandeliers that line the ceiling of the
hall has fallen, adding to the destruction.  The feasting hall continues to

walls maps map~
A series of huge maps have been left hanging limply from the walls, drawn
with a variety of arrows directing troop movements.  Although large portions
of the map have crumbled away, it is obvious that this was intended to be
used for planning of some long-forgotten upcoming military campaign.  It
seems to daringly suggest the violent take-over of Var Bandor, with lines
leading onward, to both Gaald and eventually Earendam.

even more chilling.  The feasting hall continues to the east, west, and

The Entrance to the Great Feasting Hall~
The entrance to the great feasting hall of Castle Gogoth bears the
kingdom\@s great skull crest emblazoned upon the open tile of the floor. 
Some great calamity struck near its center, long cracks radiating outward. 
Dust, debris, and ancient splotches of blood conceal quite a bit of the
floor, and a gloomy darkness shrouds hangs heavy over the rest of the hall. 
The air is stale and foul, and tinged with an evil chill.  The stairwell
waits to the north, while the hall spreads out to the east, west, and south.

The Great Feasting Hall~
This vast hall is filled with long tables and broken wooden chairs.  A
thick layer of dust coats the debris, concealing much of its ancient
grandeur.  Chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and before the fall, provided
light; in the present, they do little to illuminate the gloomy expanse.  The
air is thick and foul, and a sense of lingering evil makes the atmosphere
even more chilling.  The feasting hall continues to the north, east, and
west.

The Southeast Corner of the Feasting Hall~
This corner of the feasting hall is filled with ancient wooden tables and
collapsed chairs.  Chandeliers hang above, thick with dust and giving of no
light, their candles long having crumbled away.  The walls are cold, dark
stone, and a half-burned painting hangs stubbornly from the east wall. 
Darkness shrouds much of the hall, the sense of lingering evil too prominent
to shake off, and the air is fouled by floating dust and the smell of death.
To the north and west, the feasting hall continues.

half burned half-burned painting east wall~
Although half of it is burned, much of this painting is in remarkably
good shape.  It depicts the Gogothi champion, Lord Chulru, in upon his final
victory in Earendam\@s grand colosseum.  He raises a greatsword above his
head, which bears the kingdom\@s crest, roaring in exultation.  His opponent,
and much of the lower half of his body, are not visible due to the canvas
having burned away.  Stubborn grime spots much of the image.

These wood-lined, rotting steps lead up from the feasting hall and into a

paintings of the last Gogothi royal family.  The atmosphere is still, as if
somehow expectant, and the musty scent of rot hangs heavy in the air.  Grime

to hide their once-diabolic intent.  Various liquids have stained, burned,
and ruined the carpet underfoot, in addition to the excess of decay, debris,
and dust.  What remains of a richly furnished workspace is against the west
wall, some of its metal contraptions rusted but otherwise undamaged.  The
ceiling is cracked overhead, and through them seep the revolting smells of
the floor above.  The bedchamber proper is to the east.

This large bedroom was once richly furnished with only the finest the
kingdom of Gogoth had to offer.  However, its rare woods are splintered; its
exquisite velvets and silks lay in mouldering tatters; and the great works
of art that once adorned its walls are torched and ruined.  Everything is
covered in a thick layer of dust and debris, the air stifling with the smell
of death.  Large scratches cross the walls in a number of places, marked
with trails of ancient blood.  The remains of a laboratory wait to the west,
while a carved wooden door leads south into the hall.

A cracked painting depicts Prince Raspal, the king\@s brother, and
Princess Shaia, the queen\@s sister.  Raspal is a hulk of a man, with broad
shoulders highlighted by the tight fit of his royal attire.  His expression
is one of determination and resolve, and largely absent of mirth.  Shaia, on
the other hand, has a cheerful, pleasant look, her delicate face framed by
short, blonde hair.  She wears a fine black dress, her finger adorned with a

He looks stern but gracious, with one hand upon his wife\@s shoulder.  Wythea
is the picture of mature beauty, with a flowing gown with tight lacing along
the side.  Her hair is long and dark, framing her face.  The background of
the picture has darkened considerably, giving it a more ominous feel than
the artist may have intended.

This bedroom was once among the most fashionable in the castle, appointed
with magnificent drapes, paintings, and imported furniture.  Even now,
ruined as it is, the chamber still has a distinctly Harrudim flair, with
much of its ostentation done in the style of the far south.  Yet, mold and
decay have claimed the once-exotic furnishings, rendering them worthless. 
Three different standing mirrors crowd the northwest corner of the room, all
of them shattered and stained with dried blood.  A scorched continuation of
the bedroom waits to the east, while a wooden door leads south.

This room served as the bedroom for the many servants of the royal

assembled within.  Compared to other rooms on this floor, it is humble, its
furnishings less opulent.  The centuries have not been kind, leaving
virtually all of them in varying states of collapse.  Many beds are ruined
and sting the air with their horrific scents.  Most of the hangings and
mountings have rotted away, leaving only lonely protrusions where they once
hung.  To the east, a door leads back to the hall.

The Defiled Chapel~
This desecrated and blasted chamber is all that remains of the royal
chapel of Gogoth.  The walls are covered with a sickly green mold, decorated
by shattered holy symbols.  Fitful, murky light illuminates the chamber,
passing through a filth-encrusted oculus high above.  Kneeling pads and
prayer rails are burned and hacked to bits, littering the floor.  An altar,
stained with blood and ichor, stands in fallen splendor on a platform to the
east.  Carved into it is a diabolic symbol, prominently visible on its
marble top.  The only exit from this chamber lies through a silver door to
the west.

symbolvision~
The symbol is a concave tetragon, its irregular shape drawn with broad
strokes.  Interlaced with the edge of the tetragon are sinister stars and
diamonds, their sharp edges dangerously adjacent to each other.  At the
center of the inscription is a pointed cross, each leg tipped with an
unpleasant barb.  

The entire symbol pulses as you look at it, and its edges seem to crawl. 
Unable to draw away from this motion, your surroundings fade, and you find
yourself somewhere vastly different.....  



You stand in a bleak, lifeless place.  Towering overhead, a blasphemous bole
of bark and wood erupts from the ground.  Its boughs and branches are thick
enough to occlude the sky, and its true height is almost impossible to gauge
with the amount of overgrowth present.  

Syrupy, blood-red sap oozes out of inner pores of the tree, coagulating in
ugly clumps at its base.  Visible also are twisted and corrupted roots,
which seem more to violate the rough ground than to draw sustenance from it.


In lieu of fruits, the heads of various living things hang from the tips of
the branches, each putrefying face a mask of unspeakable agony.  Keening,
the heads cry out, perversely imitating the patterns of wind through thick
forest.  

And now, you see that the tree is tended by groups of demons.  Noticing your
attentions, they swarm around you, dragging you to the tree.  Soon, you are
buried neck-deep in the barren soil, entombed near the horrid tree.  Without
warning, one of the roots quivers, and snakes toward you across the ground! 


Unable to move, the root slithers down your throat, and lodges itself deep
within you.  As your life ebbs away, drained by the Tree, you begin to
scream, falling into harmony with the heads above......  



Trembling, you stand once more in the desecrated chapel.  You sense that the
tetragon\@s vision is now a part of you for better or for worse.

room on the far side of the hall.  This section was once used to give
audience to those who wished to petition Prince Raspal about diplomacy, war,
or service within the nation\@s Death Knights.  Ruined, indistinguishable
paintings rot out of their tarnished frames, and a series of marble busts
are toppled, shattered, onto the floor.  Three couches, likely used for such
audiences, lay in ruins, their covers mouldered and decaying.  The eastern

The courtroom of Rasadal Gogoth VII is a gloomy, dilapidated affair, with
dust and crumbling stone falling from the high ceiling.  This portion of the
court is especially blackened, its ancient banners and ornamentation utterly
consumed by flame.  Bits of ash and debris coat the floor and hang lifeless
in the stale air.  The once-patterned inlays along the courtroom wall have

The Grand Throne of Gogoth~
The black throne of Rasadal Gogoth VII towers above you on a raised dais.
Designed to impose, whoever sits upon this throne looks down upon the
courtroom, and quite possibly, all of the kingdom and its domain.  Marble
pillars support the high, dimly visible ceiling, the cracks, dust, and
heaviness of age long having settled upon the hall.  The stench of death is
powerful and stifling, making it difficult to catch a full breath.  Although
the courtroom itself is silent, a low buzzing sound fills the air.  The
courtroom continues to the east, south, and west.

The Courtroom of Gogoth~
The courtroom of Rasadal Gogoth VII is a gloomy, dilapidated affair, with
dust and crumbling stone falling from the high ceiling.  Along the entire
east side of the hall are spotted, rotting silken banners displaying the
ancient Gogothi crest.  Much of the majesty of these decorations has long
passed, but their sheer size still manages to be imposing.  Tarnished gold
ornamentation is visible this close to the wall, which form a series of
dramatic, patterned inlays into the eastern stone.  Marble pillars rise
into the darkness high above.  The raised dais of the throne is directly to
the west, while the hall continues to the south.

The Courtroom of Gogoth~
The courtroom of Rasadal Gogoth VII spreads out, the far walls barely
visible through the castle\@s tangible gloom.  Ancient marble pillars line
the court, supporting the darkened, crumbling ceiling.  The once-posh carpet
that led from the lower stairwell to the throne has long since rotted and
blackened, marked by the rare footstep.  Dust and debris line the courtroom,
as well as the odd splatter of dried blood stains.  The hall is silent, and
the aura of wickedness pervasive in the castle hangs in the air, heavy and
oppressive.  To the north lies the raised dais of the king\@s black throne,
while to the south, east, and west, the courtroom continues.
