a tired kankoran sea-reaver~
A tired kankoran reaver is here, nearly asleep on his rowing bench.
~
A straggly, brown-furred kankoran, the sea-reaver looks exhausted by his
row-work.  He nonetheless has the fierce eyes and proud demeanor of his
race, despite his lowly position as a rower on the reaver vessel.  He wears
the rough, worn clothing of a mariner.

This kankoran is particularly fierce-looking.  It has a myriad of

many sea-battles he has been in.

Ryaga the Seaclaw, the infamous kankoran pirate, stands before you.  He
doesn\@t look that impressive at first glance--a few scars mar his plain
brown fur, much like the other sea-reavers on his ship.  The one thing that
does mark him as different, on closer inspection, is a quiet air of

Airks Mund seems a congenial yet dignified man from his bearing and

A former vendor of the Jh\@ten arcane market, Airks is no longer welcomed
there.  It wasn\@t so much due to the incident with the explosion and
accidental deaths, which is still much remembered among the merchants there,
but rather to his unwillingness to cooperate with the Jh\@ten warders and

Although far too young to have been at the smithy a long time, this hardy
young man is already showing the distinctive upper body strength that is
characteristic of those in his trade.  He is dressed in an old worn pair of
hemp slacks, a thick leather apron and little else.  His long hair tied back
with a thin length of twine.

Darenhalf~
Darenhalf the human is here.
~
A forbidding-looking human is here.  He has dark brown eyes, just visible
below a sweep of pale blonde hair.  Though handsome, his features are cold
and expressionless, and his eyes lack any warmth whatsoever.  Clearly a
warrior, he has the sinewy arms of one who spends hours a day at weapons
training.

Thes the srryn is here.

A short, squat barbarian srryn stands before you, his odd proportions
making him seem somewhat grotesque.  The sound of his breathing, a loud
hissing and puffing of air through his nostril-slits, is uncommonly loud. 
Though short in height, Thes\@s black-scaled torso is unusually broad, and
his upper body is so heavily muscled that it seems a feat for him to avoid
toppling over.  A stubby tail shifts back and forth to provide balance.

Your Intimacies Revealed
Dear
In my last tryst with your sweet mother, something happened which I feel
you should be aware of.  As she moaned in deepest ecstasy, she began
to call out your name.  And we do not look alike, you and I.
incestuous one
~
>data_prog 5~
Your Dastardliness
Timid
The word has spread of your temerity, of how you wet yourself and embarrass 
your companions by fleeing from shadows. I have heard that your skills 
with cringe and faint exceed all others, and wish to see them demonstrated. 
caitiff

Stupidity Embodied
Boneheaded
Word of your fatheadedness has spread throughout the realm. The feats of
moronic and confused nature attributed to you have even the Alatharya under
a spell of disbelieving awe. I would see such feeblemindedness in person.

Your Services Required
Most Pliable
I find myself in need of a bootlicker. Your name was given to me, and so
I require your services. You are recommended as one of the finest fawning,
toadyish buffons in the realm. Present yourself to me as soon as possible.
servile one

>data_prog 8~
Superfluous?
Meritless
I have been questing for an item of absolutely no worth, and the quest has
finally led me to your good-for-nothing, wasted self. I shall preserve
you in a jar, so that all generations may marvel at your pointlessness.

Hatred Beyond Endurance
Foul
I can no longer bear the thought of your existence. Every breath you
take fouls the air, every footstep soils the earth. I shall not rest until
I spill your tainted blood and watch your last breath wane.
my despised
~
>data_prog 10~
Love
Dearest
I must confess my feelings for you, unashamedly. Long have I desired 
to hold you close and explore your depths. What sweet savors might my
tongue discover as it probes the dark recesses of your ears?

Reneaer guardian protector~
Guardian Reneaer~
Guardian Reneaer, Protector of the Western Syceera, keeps vigil here.
~
Reneaer stands directly below the Sy\@ceera, basking in the radiant white
glow shining down up her as she scans the horizon.  She has lustrous silver
hair which frames her deceptively soft features in a myriad of ringlets. 
Her glimmering golden form is arrayed in armor of beaten gold and pure
white, and she wields a mighty falchion masterfully.  

Reneaer and her twin Leava, spirit templars of the greatest skill, gained
great renown after their training for their recovery of the nightwar
artifacts once stolen from Kor Thrandir.  It is said that the twins
assaulted a party of more than a dozen void archmagi and their demons to
regain the treasured items.  After other such exploits, the Esea Spiritlord
of Shelratha offered the sisters the posts at the Sy\@ceera, and they have
served as protectors of Alensha ever since.

Guardian Leava~
Guardian Leava, Protector of the Eastern Syceera, maintains her vigil here.
~
Leava paces along the platform under the shining globe of the eastern
Sy\@ceera.  She is taller than most ch\@taren, and moves about in her
silver-plated armor comfortably, as if it weighed but little.  She keeps her
blue-black hair cropped short, and her dark blue eyes sparkle with an
intense vitality and zeal.  

Leava and her twin Reneaer, spirit templars of the greatest skill, gained
great renown after their training for their recovery of the nightwar

a leviathan~
A gargantuan mass of scales, fins, and tentacles plows through the water.

The enormity that is the leviathan plows through the water before you. 
It is difficult to see the entirety of the creature through the billowing
waves and whirling currents of water that mark its passage, but you can make
out dark scales and thick bony-ridged fins.  Massive snaky tentacles studded
with suction grips and probing tips writhe around it, seeking prey.

Shiy Oyze is a hulking alatharya sailor, still strong for his advanced
age.  His silvery skin is marred by white scars, and his thin, pallid hair
hangs limply over his large head.  His whiskered face seems permanently set
in an open-mouthed scowl, which reveals that his few remaining teeth are

This slender silver-blue fish is nearly a foot in length, and its

weapon was wrought on demonic forges beyond the void, of a strange black
steel, and was used for ages by the shuddeni, until lost to kankoran
raiders.  The kankorans discovered its dark power over time, and it has
become prized among them as well.

basicmap_desc~
An extremely worn parchment has what appears to be a map, written in a
rough scrawl.  You can vaguely make out what seem to be hills, forests,
and shores, but the map is too faded to clearly make out any landmarks.
However, a text is written to the side of the map, in a mix of common 
script and kankoran ideograph, is still mostly visible, though the right
side of the parchment is heavily worn and some letters on the edge
of the parchment have become complete indistinguishable.

A mass of chaos moved upon the prime,
An instability of form and time. 
Dischordant overtones without a scale,
Its audience of stars, a distant veil--
Commingled molten blaze and liquid misted,
Shards of stone and hissing vapors twisted,
Wreathed in glints of spirit\@s silver light
And ringed in splintered shadows of void\@s night.
   In chaos unimaginable rolled
   The raw materials that formed the world.

From otherwheres and otherwhens came Three
Across the planar boundaries to be,
Drawn from other multiverses far
By primal promise held in Avendar.

And ringed in splintered shadows of void\@s night.
   In chaos unimaginable rolled
   The raw materials that formed the world.

From otherwheres and otherwhens came Three
Across the planar boundaries to be,
Drawn from other multiverses far
By primal promise held in Avendar.

*This card is a thin, stiff, springy sheet of burnished steel.  The
rounded corners are etched with a scrolling, twining abstract pattern. 
Writing curls its was across the back and front.  * 

twilight shrouds a silent sea
alone, starlit waters lap
the quiet beach, my comfort
sand between my toes
timeless, unfeeling  
  
the dim sky above shudders
as a patient horizon
becomes resplendent herald
the cool sea aflame
light engulfing me

the Lightbringer\@s gaze searing
I cast off my coverings
fear and sadness, doubt and shame
the waters roaring
surface blazing foam

I yield all, naked and rapt
waves clothing in purest white
disappointments forgotten
joy consuming me
I trembled

breathless

the furious waters still
embers glowing at my feet
my eyes, wet with salt-sea spray
first light now shining
as all dawns before

This blade was old even when first brought to Avendar by ch\@taren during

Sh\@himmao, using the lost ch\@taren arts of making.  The blades were
instilled with special powers against creatures of demonic nature or those
that revile the light, to battle the hordes of vile creatures that Ashur
caused to attack the ch\@taren homeworld cities.  Vanrent blazes with white
light in battle against demonkind, and does them great harm.

Off the Northwestern Coast of Alensha~
The waters of the Uthlin stretch out around you on all sides.  The water
is a deep blue-green, murky enough to obscure the view of anything more than
a few meters beneath the surface.  The crying of gulls and rippling splashes
stand out against the soft, lulling sound of the waves which roll inexorably
along toward the coastline of Alensha.  From this distance, the coastline is
little more than a hazy blot on the horizon, far to the southeast.

Off the Western Coast of Alensha~
All around you, the low, steady swells of the ocean rise and fall,
stately in their unchanging roll eastward.  The salty ocean air carries upon
it other, fainter scents--the smell of pines from the island whose outline
is a blur on the eastern horizon, and others less easy to identify.  The
water, a deep blue- green, reflects the light of both moon or sun in softer
measure, and the small amounts of light that illuminate the first few meters
of the ocean surface are quickly swallowed up in the shadows of the Uthlin
depths.

Off the Western Coast of Alensha~
The deep-blue Uthlin waters surround you on all sides, some distance off
the western coast of Alensha.  The island from this distance is nothing more
than a blurry grey shape set into the sea-line of the eastern horizon.  The
details of the island are indistinguishable from this distance.  You hear
the faint, low murmur of the swelling waves, calls from the sea-birds that
wheel overhead, and the infrequent hum of dragonflies skimming over the
waves.

Off the Western Coast of Alensha~
You are on the deep, vast expanse of the Uthlin ocean, its water
stretching out in all directions.  The boundless horizon is interrupted only
by a faint blur far to the east, a hint of land where the Island of Alensha
raises up from the depths to take its solitary position in the outer Uthlin.
Low swells of water roll and wave gently, and the blue-green depths below
you reveal silent, gliding shapes of ocean life.

creates a thin, briney mist that gives the appearance of fog in the

stately in their unchanging roll northward.  The salty ocean air carries
upon it other, fainter scents--the smell of pines from the island whose
outline is a blur on the northeastern horizon, and others less easy to
identify.  The water, a deep blue-green, reflects the light of both moon or
sun in softer measure, and the small amounts of light that illuminate the
first few meters of the ocean surface are quickly swallowed up in the
shadows of the Uthlin depths.

Off the Northwestern Coast of Alensha~
All around you, the low, steady swells of the ocean rise and fall,
stately in their unchanging roll to the south and east.  The salty ocean air
carries upon it other, fainter scents--the smell of pines from the island
whose outline is a blur on the southeastern horizon, and others less easy to
identify.  The water, a deep blue-green, reflects the light of both moon or
sun in softer measure, and the small amounts of light that illuminate the
first few meters of the ocean surface are quickly swallowed up in the
shadows of the Uthlin depths.

Uthlin.  Low swells of water roll and wave gently, and the blue-green depths

that turns into a rough path leading down to the shore.

The relentless waves of the Uthlin have worn away the rock in the cliff
base, forming a small hollow within it.  Several meters separate the waves
from the mass of rock overhead.  To the west, the waves give way to a rough,
rocky beach, which climbs out from the hollow and into the open sky.  Thick
rusted anchoring rings have been set in the cliff wall along the shore,
where fishermen have kept boats sheltered from the elements.  The sea

Along the Southern Shore of Alensha~
The unending ocean waves roll northward to lap at the stony, rough beach
that stretches along this part of the Isle of Alensha.  Foam, bits of
driftwood, and a few broken shells are left by the receding waves, only to
be picked up and shifted when the waves once again come in.

The deep-blue Uthlin waters surround you on all sides, some distance off

more than a blurry gray shape set into the sea-line of the northern horizon.
The details of the island are indistinguishable from this distance.  You

paper-like material.  A window in the northern wall overlooks the waters of
the Uthlin ocean, which meet the shore just a few feet from the edge of the
hut.  Three mats of bound rushes are spread along the western wall, a table

A fairly wide, clear path winds from the south, and then descends at this

to make a flat, smooth wall, an image has been engraved in the stone.  The

Along the Northern Shore of Alensha~
There is a small, sandy beach along this stretch of the northern
shoreline.  The waves approach, leaving traces of foam and bits of seaweed
and shell, and then recede, erasing and reclaiming the flotsam.  To the
south, further back on the island, lie large fields of dusty golden-white
grains and orchards of violent-blossomed fruit trees.

A small, grassy yard is enclosed by a sturdy wooden fence which also
encompasses a stilted wooden hut to the west.  The hut has a simple door

in a simple stone basin.  There are a few small trees and potted, colorful
flowers along the yard path that stretches from the door of the hut to the
narrow opening in the northern stretch of the fence.  Beyond the fence, a
small beach of dark sand meets the deep blue waters of the Uthlin ocean.  To

Brilliant yellowish buds nearly hide the green leaves of the goldenrain
trees that surround you.  Smaller flowering plants, woody shrubs, and a few

The waters of the Uthlin stretch out around you on all sides.  The water
is a deep blue-green, murky enough to obscure the view of anything more than
a few meters beneath the surface.  The crying of gulls and rippling splashes
stand out against the soft, lulling sound of the waves which roll inexorably
along toward the coastline of Alensha.  From this distance, the coastline is

You are on the deep, vast expanse of the Uthlin ocean, its water
stretching out in all directions.  The boundless horizon is interrupted only
by a faint blur far to the south, a hint of land where the Island of Alensha
raises up from the depths to take its solitary position in the outer Uthlin.
Low swells of water roll and wave gently, and the blue-green depths below

framed in a seemingly haphazard arrangement of wooden beams, set at
different angles and lengths, with a strange, semi-translucent substance
between them, forming the bulk of the wall.  The effect of the walls is
similar to that of a stained glass collage.  The path passes by the hut,
leading north to a small beach of gravely black sand that borders the waters
of the Uthlin ocean, and passing south among the fields that lie on the
outskirts of Jh\@ten.

All around you, the low, steady swells of the ocean rise and fall,
stately in their unchanging roll northward.  The salty ocean air carries
upon it other, fainter scents--the smell of pines from the island whose
outline is a blur on the northern horizon, and others less easy to identify.
The water, a deep blue-green, reflects the light of both moon or sun in
softer measure, and the small amounts of light that illuminate the first few

Off the Southern Coast of Alensha~
The cry of seabirds, the salty sea breeze, and the distance lulling
murmur of waves surround you here, out on the great expanse of the Uthlin
ocean.  The ocean waters are a clean blue-green, and become veiled with
shadows a just a few meters below the surface, as light is swallowed up in
the darkness of the ocean depths.  The water gently swells around you,
forming low rolling waves that glide toward the southern shore of Alensha,
barely visible in the distance.

Off the Northern Coast of Alensha~
The waters of the Uthlin stretch out around you on all sides.  The water
is a deep blue-green, murky enough to obscure the view of anything more than
a few meters beneath the surface.  The crying of gulls and rippling splashes
stand out against the soft, lulling sound of the waves which roll inexorably
along toward the coastline of Alensha.  From this distance, the coastline is
little more than a hazy blot on the horizon, far to the south.

Off the Northern Coast of Alensha~
All around you, the low, steady swells of the ocean rise and fall,
stately in their unchanging roll southward.  The salty ocean air carries
upon it other, fainter scents--the smell of pines from the island whose
outline is a blur on the southern horizon, and others less easy to identify.
The water, a deep blue-green, reflects the light of both moon or sun in
softer measure, and the small amounts of light that illuminate the first few
meters of the ocean surface are quickly swallowed up in the shadows of the
Uthlin depths.

The path continues here, running east to west between two wooden fences.
In each fence is set a simple gate.  Beyond the northern fence, vine-covered
racks are placed in long rows.  Across the southern fence, silver-white
stalks of the wheat-like dushasn grow thick and waist-high.  You see shapes
in the distance moving among vineyard and through the dushasn fields, and

bud, and pale green shoots are sprouting up from among the white clumps. 
The ground is slightly muddy, which could account for the field laborers
leaving the harvest unfinished.  Set in the wooden fence to the north, a

Broad wooden planks, much nicked and cut, form a crude pavement for the
Jh\@ten wharf.  The wharf is cluttered with stacks of boxes, clusters of
barrels, and small stands where fisherman sell their odorous goods. 
Dockworkers and sailors move about in seeming disorder.  To the north, the
wooden planks give way to the even cobblestones of Aolar Avenue.  Eastward
the wharf extends out into a shallow pier.  Further east, in Shao Bay,
several large vessels are anchored.  

To the north, a sturdy metal barrier has been erected.  You can see the even

The wooden planking of the wharf comes to an end, here.  A few rough

begins in the sandy soil not far from the water\@s edge.  The path runs
southward along the city wall and quickly disappears into a forest of
goldenrain trees.  Murmuring softly, low gentle waves reach the sandy shore,
formed by the wake of the boats passing through the bay.

Outside the Walls of Jh\@ten~
You are on a broad path which runs around the city and passes by fields
of silver-white dushasn.  The dirt path is well-trodden, and has clearly
seen much travel.  To the south, the white stone walls of Jh\@ten rise up
majestically, the white stone gleaming as if recently polished.  Beyond them
the tops of slender ch\@lonin-streaked towers are visible.

The Jh\@ten Wharf~
You stand on a wharf at the end of the eastern wall of Jhten.  The tall,
white-stone wall stops at a massive column of smooth, chlonin-streaked
stone.  Beyond the wall you can see the even cobblestoned streets of Jhten. 
There is a constant motion around you, with dockworkers and fishermen coming
and going, merchants and fishermen selling their wares, and fishermen
dangling lines from the pier.  

To the west and north, a sturdy metal barrier has been erected, barring
access to the city.

whose outline is a blur on the northwestern horizon, and others less easy to

Along the Northeastern Shore of Alensha~
The waves lap against the stony shoreline, making a low, repeating
rumble.  Just beyond the shoreline stands a fence of mortared stones,
running along the shoreline and bending with it as it sweeps in a broad
curve.  Beyond the fence, a field of dusty golden grain is visible, and off
in the distance rise the white towers of Jh\@ten.

A Field of Dushasn~
You are in the northeastern corner of a vast field of dushasn.  The
stalks of dushasn are silver, with some drier stalks here and there a
whiter, faded color.  The drooping heads of grain are a cream-white color. 
The ground is uneven due to irrigation furrows that run south to north
through the length of the field.  Beyond the stone wall that encircles the
field, to the north and east, the blue-green waters of the Uthlin Ocean
stretch off in to the distance.

A Field of Dushasn~
You are on the southeastern end of a field of dushasn.  This part of the
field has been recently harvested, and a few sheaves of silver-white dushasn
still lie in bundles on the ground.  The rough stubble is beginning to bud,
and pale green shoots are sprouting up from among the white clumps.  To the

Off the Northeastern Coast of Alensha~
All around you, the low, steady swells of the ocean rise and fall,
stately in their unchanging roll to the south and west.  The salty ocean air
carries upon it other, fainter scents--the smell of pines from the island
whose outline is a blur on the southwestern horizon, and others less easy to
identify.  The water, a deep blue-green, reflects the light of both moon or
sun in softer measure, and the small amounts of light that illuminate the
first few meters of the ocean surface are quickly swallowed up in the
shadows of the Uthlin depths.

ocean.  The ocean waters are a clean blue-green, and become veiled with
shadows a just a few meters below the surface, as light is swallowed up in
the darkness of the ocean depths.  The water gently swells around you,
forming low rolling waves that glide toward the southeastern shore of
Alensha, barely visible in the distance.

Off the Southeastern Coast of Alensha~
You are on the deep, vast expanse of the Uthlin ocean, its water
stretching out in all directions.  The boundless horizon is interrupted only
by a faint blur far to the northwest, a hint of land where the Island of
Alensha raises up from the depths to take its solitary position in the outer
Uthlin.  Low swells of water roll and wave gently, and the blue-green depths
below you reveal silent, gliding shapes of ocean life.

The waters of the Uthlin stretch out around you on all sides.  The water
is a deep blue-green, murky enough to obscure the view of anything more than
a few meters beneath the surface.  The crying of gulls and rippling splashes
stand out against the soft, lulling sound of the waves which roll inexorably
along toward the coastline of Alensha.  From this distance, the coastline is
little more than a hazy blot on the horizon, far to the southwest.

Off the Eastern Coast of Alensha~
The cry of seabirds, the salty sea breeze, and the distance lulling
murmur of waves surround you here, out on the great expanse of the Uthlin
ocean.  The ocean waters are a clean blue-green, and become veiled with
shadows a just a few meters below the surface, as light is swallowed up in
the darkness of the ocean depths.  The water gently swells around you,
forming low rolling waves that glide toward the eastern shore of Alensha,
barely visible in the distance.

Off the Eastern Coast of Alensha~
You are on the deep, vast expanse of the Uthlin ocean, its water
stretching out in all directions.  The boundless horizon is interrupted only
by a faint blur far to the west, a hint of land where the Island of Alensha
raises up from the depths to take its solitary position in the outer Uthlin.
Low swells of water roll and wave gently, and the blue-green depths below
you reveal silent, gliding shapes of ocean life.

Off the Eastern Coast of Alensha~
The deep sapphire blue and aqua green waters of the Uthlin form a virtual
kaleidoscope of sparkling green-blue hues as the rolling swells reflect the
light of sun or moons.  The soft, lulling murmur of the waves is interrupted
at intervals by the lonely calls of solitary sea-birds and the occasional
splash of a leaping fish.  Far and faint in the distance, the eastern
shoreline of Alensha is visible.

Uthlin meets the rocky shoreline.  A broad green plateau covers the western
side of the island, save for this high mountainous peak.  The plateau
eventually slopes down to the east, breaking into forested, hilly terrain
and cultivated fields.  And far to the east, the city of Jh\@ten, with its

The Uthlin Ocean~
The waters of the Uthlin stretch out around you on all sides.  The water
is a deep blue-green, murky enough to obscure the view of anything more than
a few meters beneath the surface.  Low, steady swells rise and fall.  The
occasional cry of a distant gull and the lulling murmur of the waves are the
only sounds you can hear.  On all horizons, only the line of the distant
waves is visible.

On a Narrow Arch Between Minarets~
A narrow arch of polished marble spans from one Sy\@ceeran minaret to the
other.  The arch serves to support the minarets, but could also serve as a
precarious bridge from one slender tower to the other.  Above the top of
each minaret, the Sy\@ceera, shining spheres of light that blaze like white
suns, are suspended in the air.

The Bearkeeper\@s Room~
You stand in a simple, windowless bedroom whose single entrance and exit

paneling that covers the walls, a faint musky scent and a strong fish odor
hang in the air.  A large hammock hangs from the ceiling, and various pieces
of simple furniture--a small table and chair, trunks, a barrel, among other
things--are placed around the room.

Behind the Ilrel Cascade~
A small ledge of stone extends here above a shallow pool of water.  The
ledge runs east to west and is just narrow enough to walk on.  At the
eastern end of ledge is a small boat mooring, a small rounded pillar in
which iron rings are set.  At the western end of the ledge is a small wooden
door.  To the south, a break in the rough stone walls is covered in mist,
and the sound of streaming, falling water can be heard.

A Bridge Over the Ilrel Cascade~
This slender stone bridge is sturdily built, with thick timber supports
below to hold the walkway up above the hundreds of small falls and pouring
rivulets that form the scenic Ilrel Cascade.  The many falls create a light,
splashing burble of water which grows to a louder rumble to the south, as
the cascade steepens.  The bridge is old and worn with the passage of feet
from pilgrims to the Anaiama Crystals, those strange rock formations that
protrude up from among the darker volcanic rocks.  The bridge passes quite
close to the crystals, close enough for one to lean down and touch them.

nearly anything.  The smaller cages are lashed onto pegs and hooks that jut
out from the plankwork.  The unpleasant smell of animals and filth is strong
in this end of the hold.  The floor moves very slightly under your feet,
gently swaying as the ship rides the waves.

The Depths of the Uthlin Ocean~
Below the surface, the waters are ice-cold.  A slight unsteady current
that is reflected in the waves above tugs very faintly at you.  Little is
visible in the blue-green water around you, save for minute floating
particles, a few darting fish, and faint shifting shapes unrecognizable in
the distance.  Below you, the blue-green water turns grey and then black,

The Bow of the Cirroh~
You are in the bow of a sleek, shallow longship that measures nearly 25
meters in length.  A single mast rises up in the center of the ship, and
bears a furled, carefully worked whale-hide sail.  The ship timbers are all
of the seasoned karacha hardwood that is favored in kankoran shipcrafting. 
The timbers are covered in scratches and nicks, showing evidence of much
wear.  The front of the craft tapers inward and upward.  The wooden keel
rises up 3 meters at the very front end, where the figurehead, a vicious
wolf, is frozen in a permanent, snarling leap.

You are in the aft of a sleek, shallow longship that measures nearly 25
meters in length.  A single mast rises up in the center of the ship, and
bears a furled, carefully worked whale-hide sail.  The ship timbers are all
of the seasoned karacha hardwood that is favored in kankoran shipcrafting. 
The timbers are covered in scratches and nicks, showing evidence of much
wear.  The end of the craft tapers inward and upward here, and the wooden
keel rises up 3 meters at the very tail end.  It is pierced by a thick peg
from which lanterns hang.

The Swordsmith\@s Home~
Four walls of rough-hewn logs topped with a thatched roof form a simple,
small hut.  The floor is hard-packed earth, swept clean and pale brown.  The
furnishings--a few reed pallets, an old, stout table, and a feather-filled
mattress on an iron frame, are kept neat and in good repair.  In the south
wall a window is set, its wooden shutters open, providing a glimpse of the
wind-swept, grassy Alensha plateau and the hazy blue ocean far beyond. 
Simple wooden doors are in the eastern and northern walls.

The Swordsmith\@s Forge~
This small smithying shop is enclosed within low, rough walls of mortared
rock and stones.  Over the walls you can see the green plateau of Alensha,
and the steep mountainous peak that rises to the west.  In one corner of the
shop, an unusual roof of thin tin sheets is raised up on iron poles to
shelter to the forge, bellows, and other important smithying implements. 
The bottom of the shelter is blacked with soot.  The ground is hard-packed
earth, though near the walls and around the boxes, crates and piles of metal
rods, low-cut grass and a few tenacious wildflowers have sprung up.

The Deck of the Arafia~
You are on the starboard deck of the Arafia, a two-masted merchant ship. 
It is an old ship, as evidenced by the worn planking and woodwork, the
patched and sun-bleached canvas sails, and the tarnished metal fixtures. 
Nonetheless, it seems in good repair and upkeep.  A rope ladder hangs from
the side of the ship.

The Bow of the Arafia~
Here the ship\@s beams and rails bend in a shallow curve to form the prow.
At the very tip of the prow, worked in solid oak, stands the figurehead--a
bearded mage who leans forward over the water with a staff clutched before
him, a somber and determined expression on his face.  Anchoring rings for
ropes and nets are set into the low rail the sweeps along the sides of the
ship, and the wooden planks show signs of much wear despite their polish.

In the Rigging~
You pass over a lattice of ropes and supporting beams which support and
help to control the Arafia\@s sails.  From this high vantage point you have a
clear view of the surrounding bay, and westward, the isle of Alensha and the
gleaming walls and towers of Jh\@ten.

A Dark Grotto~
You are in a dark, narrow channel of rough stone.  Half-filled with chill
water, the channel forms a grotto which extends to the north.  At the
southern end of the grotto, however, the uneven floor of the channel
suddenly drops off, and there is a dim, unhealthy glow slightly visible
through the murkiness of the deeper water.

The Sea Hag\@s Lair~
This rough stone chamber is completely filled with murky water.  The
walls are jagged and uneven--the few smooth surfaces are defaced with strange
runes and unwholesome-looking symbols.  From the bottom of the chamber, in
the center, a small black chest decorated in elaborate carvings emits a
faint green glow.

The Home of Laeraiel and Myriniana~
A curious blend of styles from both the mainland and the Green Isle greet
the senses as soon as you enter the cozy home.  Three walls are constructed
of thick, Nendorin oak, while a translucent silky canvas stretches across
the opening to the south, revealing a breathtaking view of the ocean. 
Small, coloured glass jars, each set with their own glowing ball of light,
hang indiscriminately about the room, filling the room with a wonderous
combination of light and soft shadow.  Above, a simple, metal mobile of a
flock of birds dangles from the ceiling, their forms dancing to and fro with
the slightest breeze.  A small stone hearth is built into the wall.

flock~
Hanging upon a web of wires is a multitude of metallic silhouettes, each
molded painstakingly to resemble a bird.  Light from below traces its
ethereal fingers along the outer edges, creating a warm, silvery glint that
sparkles in the darkness.  Each bird has been shaped to resemble either a
dove or a sparrow, and no two are exactly the same in the length.  Spaced
consistently apart in a circle, even the slightest breeze is enough to knock
one piece into another, producing a delicate, chime-like melody.

A Bridge of Gold~
A narrow bridge of gold spans a fathomless void.  The bridge is only just
wide enough for a single person, with no railings or other hand-holds.  To
cross it requires great care and certainty of motion.  Ahead, the bridge
ends at a luminous gate of brass.

The Brazen Gate~
To the east rises the imposing mass of the Brazen Gate, shining with an
ageless luster.  The huge bars are bossed with the figure of twin suns in
radiant gold, throwing beams of light off into the darkness.  What lies
behind the gate cannot be seen, obscured by the dazzling brilliance of the
design, too bright to look upon directly.

The Temple of the Seraphim~
The arched vaults of the ceiling soar overhead, far out of sight, lost in
the golden light of a great midday.  The stone of the temple is like marble,
but shot through with glistening threads of silver, taking up and casting
off reflections from the riot of golden sunlight to dapple the temple with a
rapturous iridescence of splendor.  The floor at the center of the temple is
a great alabaster sunburst, each point the perch of a resplendent statue:
the Convocation of the Nine.

E
pharul~
The gaze of Pharul is a hard one to meet, with all the intensity of the
thunderbolt locked in the ruby orbs.  The statue leans forward in eager
pursuit, its jaw set in a knife-edge line of resolve.  Vast wings spread
behind him, depicted in the very instant of unfurling.  
~
E
in\@vesi~
The eyes of In\@vesi have the look of a predatory bird\@s, fixed with
tremendous intensity on some point far off in the distance.  About his
glistening person are fixed the tools of the archer, with a mighty bow in
hand and a quiver of platinum-fletched arrows at his back.  
~
E
shathalith~
Physically the smallest of the statues, Shathalith\@s stands as if hunched
by age and care.  He is clothed in simple white robes: the garments of a
priest.  His arms are folded across his breast, palms up, cradling an orb of
purest gold.  
~
E
nelowesh~
Nelowesh\@s is a willowy beauty, but feels none the less substantial in
this blaze of gold.  Silvery hair is pinned atop her head, and her soft
features find their purest expression in the white gleam of her eyes. 
Nelowesh holds an ornate chalice in a gesture of invitation.  
~
E
levishul~
Robed in bejeweled messenger\@s clothes, the statue of Levishul stands
erect, with arms outstretched in proclamation.  The beauty of its face is
stunning, its quicksilver eyes glowing brilliantly.  In its right hand, the
statue holds a clarion of pure silver.  
~
E
ealaira~
Ealaira, the Guardian, stands beside the statue of Chel\@latar, her golden
eyes ever watchful.  One shining arm is stretched over Chel\@latar in a
gesture of sororal protection, while the other holds a rune-etched circular
blade at the ready.  
~
E
chel\@latar~
The pregnant Chel\@latar is garbed in flowing robes, the stone of the
statue carved to translucent thinness so that it seems to glow in the
noontide radiance of the temple.  Upon her brow is bound a diadem of
sapphire, flashing in the light.  
~
E
cheloweven~
The statue of Cheloweven is a slender, graceful thing, depicted beating
her six wings in flight.  Curls of golden hair stream from her war-helm,
showing her great speed.  A golden shield is pressed to her armored breast,
and she carries a javelin slung across her back.  
~
E
adurranash~
Tallest of the Seraphim, Adurranash stands proud.  His unclad body is
powerfully muscled, and marked with the scars of countless victories, all
honorably upon his breast.  In his mighty hand is clasped a standard of fire
and ch\@lonin.  
~
E
statues~
Statues ring the alabaster sunburst at the center of the temple, facing inward.

Adurranash, the Standard-Bearer
Cheloweven, the Seraph Eminence
Chel\@latar, the Ecclesiarch

Levishul, the Emissary of the Ishia
