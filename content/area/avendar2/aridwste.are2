#NAME Karalik Lsakia nomad leader
#SHORT Karalik
#LONG The leader of the Lsakia, Karalik, stands silently by the spring.

#BEGIN_DESCRIBABLE
#BEGIN_DESC
A tall, somewhat thin man, Karalik keeps a silent watch over the spring. 
Although human, his dark skin seems unnaturally rough.  His brown hair is
tied back in a short pony tail with a leather cord.  He wears the loose,
sand colored clothing of the rest of his tribe, no apparent outward mark
denoting him as leader.  Despite this, his is a commanding presence, his
brown eyes shine with a keen intensity and his slight frame seems to carry
more strength than one would expect.  

Said to be the son of a Nendorin hierophant of the druidic arts, Karalik
left his native forests for the waste.  His strength with the power of the
earth is respected among the Lsakia.  This strength, combined with his keen
mind and great courage, eventually rose him to a position of leadership
within the tribe.  Now in his middle years, Karalik sees to the ceremonial
duties of leadership as well as the more practical ones of trade.

An aged caladaran, Imirnsa's brown hair is streaked with grey, but his
green eyes are still sharp and lucid.  Dressed in the sand-colored clothing
of the Lsakia, Imirnsa's similarly colored barklike skin almost blends into
it.  Standing watch over the goats, the tall caladaran guides their grazing
with soft words and gentle use of the shepherds crook he carries.  

Said to be a powerful druid, Imirnsa recently stepped down from leadership
of the Lsakia, turning the position over to Karalik.  He now spends his days
in quiet thought and relaxation as he tends the herd of the tribe.  His
retirement does not seem to have softened the caladaran, however, his body
is still well-toned and his movements graceful and quick.

say An inability to let go is what creates the cities that mar Avendar's wilderness.

A scaly brown-green hide covers Siyhas, several shades darker than the
sand-colored clothing he wears.  A fierce warrior and a skilled hunter,
Siyhas also is charged with the training of the reptilian srorsians the
Lsakia use as pack animals.  Despite the obvious power in his frame, the
srryn is remarkably gentle to the lizards, careing for them as if brethren-
which after a fashion, they are.  

A strong templar of the flames, Siyhas is descended of a line that left
their native swamps, eventually settling in the waste.  It was the first of
these ancestors that tamed the srorsians, and the mantle of such has been
passed down from generation to generation.

A large, brown scaled lizard, the srorsian lumbers about upon four

long, thick tail about five feet in length.  Its head is small, compared to
the rest of the creature and its black eyes gaze about its surroundings in
apparent oblivion to the goings-on around it.  It's mouth has a row of sharp
teeth, more for cutting through grass than flesh, however.  The pack-beasts
of the Lsakia, the srorsians are a tough breed.  Able to walk long distances
and withstand the heat of the waste, they serve their function excellently.

A large, brown scaled lizard, the srorsian lumbers about upon four stumpy
legs.  It's back arches into the air and its body tapering into a long,
thick tail about five feet in length.  Its head is small, compared to the
rest of the creature and its black eyes gaze about its surroundings in
apparent oblivion to the goings-on around it.  It's mouth has a row of sharp
teeth, more for cutting through grass than flesh, however.  The pack-beasts
of the Lsakia, the srorsians are a tough breed.  Able to walk long distances
and withstand the heat of the waste, they serve their function excellently. 

Tied to a post, this lizard placidly awaits the return of its master.

The blade extends straight a foot and a half from the handle before curving
for another two, giving the kopesh a sickle-like appearance.  The weapon is
heavy and slightly unwieldy, but the edge has been sharped to a razor.

#LORE An ancient symbol of the leadership of the Lsakia, 'Lrili Jiajmi' was
forged by caladaran scholars and druids not long after the advent of earth
magics.  Blessed with the powers of earth by the mages and forged in its
sickle-like shape by the hierophants, the sword was dubbed 'Lrili Jiajmi',
or Sand Dancer in the caladaran tongue.  

The kopesh itself has been passed down through the nomadic tribes of the
southern wastes for centuries.  The blade was recently passed to the templar
Karalik when the then-leader, Imirnsa, stepped down from the position.

Looking over the gully to the north, you can see the yellow-green spread
of the savannah.  No such verdant sprawl lies here, only cracked, sunbaked
clay.  The waste spreads south from the plains, a vast, unending carpet of
sandy brown.  The air is dry here, little moisture making it over the
western mountians whose jagged foothills impede movement.  Clouds rarely
pass through the sky overhead, and seldom remain when they do.  The puffs of
moisture are rapidly evaporated by the burning sun.  The vegetation here is
sparse, with few plants hardy enough to survive the withering heat of the
sun.  Eastward, the ground begins to become stony, making movement even more
hazardous for those not airborne.  A furrow in the desert earth is
percievable to the south, a small canyon of some sort.

The ground here slopes downward into a large ravine.  The small canyon
cuts a deep furrow southeast through the dry, sandy plains.  The crack seems
naturally formed, most likely in an earthquake.  All about you spreads a
carpet of sun-baked clay, spreading in all directions save south, where the
furrow lies.  The air is dry here, little moisture making it over the
western mountains looming on the horizon.  Clouds rarely pass through the
sky overhead, and seldom remain when they do.  The puffs of moisture are
rapidly evaporated by the burning sun.

The ravine gouges nearly twenty feet into the earth.  Its bottom is sandy
but its walls are still jagged, not yet weathered by the abrasive winds of
the waste.  The ravine continues to cut south and appears to have been
created by some relatively recent earthquake.  Providing a partial haven
from the burning sun and howling winds, all manner of small insects scurry
within the rough hollows of the walls.  The ground slopes upward toward the
northern edge, allowing one to climb out.

A field of stone-littered, sunbaked clay spreads around you, the stones
about you apparently not of natural origin.  Most of the rocks appear to
have once been the cobbling of a road running through the waste.  The bits
and pieces of granite stretch to the north and east.  A ravine cuts through
the brown wastes along the edge of the stony ruins, cutting along the
southwest borders of the ruins.  The steep drop-off seems to stop any
non-aerial movement over the gully but a crude wooden bridge allows crossing
to the south.

The jagged foothills of the Mlejian mountains that impede the clouds and
deprive the waste of moisture and shade loom to the west.  The ground here
is rocky, and the western mountains grow too high and steep to be climbed
and thusly cut off that direction for travel.  The dry, cracked plains lie
to the east while the foothills continue along the base of the western
mountains to the north and south.

A field of stone-littered, sunbaked clay spreads around you, the stones
about you apparently not of natural origin.  Most of the rocks appear to
have once been the cobbling of a road running through the waste.  To the
south, the quasi-ruins continue.  A large ravine cuts a furrow to your

the west, keeping the clouds at bay, denying any protection from the sun.

This old rope and board bridge spans over a large ravine.  Supported on
both ends by a pair of wooden posts, it leads to the northernside of the
canyon.  The bridge creaks with every movement, threatening to fall as aged
rope and wood strain.  The crack seems naturally formed, most likely in an
earthquake.  The bottom of the ravine, a good twenty feet down, is mostly
hidden by the shadows created by its walls.  Southward the brown plains
spread, while the bridge continues north.  More of the furrow spreads to the
east.

through the dry, brown waste.  The crack seems naturally formed, most likely

This path winds through the cracked plains of the waste.  Deep ruts mark
this road, dug by years of caravan wagons carrying trade through the desert.
The air about you is dry, the moisture baked away by the fierce rays of the
sun.  Few clouds drift past the western mountains visible far to the west,
and those that do are quickly evaporated in the heat.  Vegetation is sparse,
little growing save the occasion thorny bush or defiant tuft of brown grass.
Far off in the west, you can make out a depression in the unending flatness,
a dark slash in the brown plains.  The path itself continues to run south
and north, connecting Var Bandor to Ashta Harrud.

The ground is uneven, consisting of cracked, sunbaked clay.  The waste
spreads about you in all directions, a vast, unending carpet of sandy brown.
The air is dry here, little moisture making it over the mountains visible
over the western horizon.  Clouds rarely pass through the sky overhead, and
seldom remain when they do.  The puffs of moisture are rapidly evaporated by
the burning sun.  Little grows here, save the occasional thorny bush or
defiant tuft of brown grass.  To the west, a ravine gouges a vicious furrow
in the cracked plains while a path runs through the waste to the east.

This path winds through the cracked plains of the waste.  Deep ruts mark
this road, dug by years of caravan wagons carrying trade through the desert.
The air about you is dry, the moisture baked away by the fierce rays of the
sun.  Few clouds drift past the western mountains visible far to the west,
and those that do are quickly evaporated in the heat.  Vegetation is sparse,
little growing save the occasion thorny bush or defiant tuft of brown grass.
Far off to the west, you can make out a depression in the unending flatness,
a dark slash in the brown plains.  The rutted path curves east from the
north as it continues.

This path winds through the cracked plains of the waste.  Deep ruts mark
this road, dug by years of caravan wagons carrying trade through the desert.
The air about you is dry, the moisture baked away by the fierce rays of the
sun.  Few clouds drift past the western mountains visible far to the west,
and those that do are quickly evaporated in the heat.  Vegetation is sparse,
little growing save the occasion thorny bush or defiant tuft of brown grass.
A large stone arch looms the the south, the path leading underneath it, its
unique shape having been sculpted by years of wind and sand.

The cracked and sunbaked clay beneath you comes to a sudden end to the
east, dropping off sharply into a giant canyon.  The walls of the opposite
side, some two hundred feet away, are banded.  The striped bands reflect
dozens of earth tones.  The canyon gouges deeply into the earth.  Its upper
walls seem jagged, suggesting a formation by an earthquake, but near the

A woolen tarp of dull gray stands as protection from the fierce sun of
the waste.  The cracked earth has been trod solid by the scaly feet of the
srorsians used by the Lsakia as pack animals.  A large trough, filled with
little water, serves to sate the thirsts of the reptiles.  An animal stench
of rotted meat and dung hangs thick in the air, although most of the Lsakia
seem not to notice.  The foothills of the Mlejian mountains rise up close
north and west of the canvas, making movement impossible.  Eastward the exit
from the camp is visible while the ground raises to the south somewhat,
creating a small, stony hill.

Apparently a main footpath into this encampment, the entrance is not the
only means into the collection of tarps and goods, merely the most used one.
To the south and west, the Lsakia encampment spreads, woolen tarps set up
for protection from the fierce sun.  Crates and bags of goods lie about the
path, awaiting transport to Ashta Harrud or northwards to Var Bandor.  The
containers hold cargo ranging from medicinal herbs to deadly venoms, the
harvest and livelihood of the tribe.  The path leads back out into the waste
to the northeast, while southwest lies the camp of the Lsakia tribe.

The rocky earth gives way to the smooth stone of the foothills.  The
hills of the Mlejian mountains loom to the south and west.  Even as they
block travel, they provide something far more precious- water.  A trickle
runs down from the mountains, collecting in a small pool.  The pool is no
more than a pace or two across and is hardly a hand deep, small by any
standard.  The stony ground slopes down toward the tarps and crates of the
camp to the north and east.

A woolen tarp of dull gray stands as protection from the fierce sun of
the waste.  Within the shade, several blankets are laid out over the cracked
and beaten earth, allowing one to rest more comfortably.  Small stacks of
boxes and the occasional bag lie underneath the tarp as well.  Most of the
members of the Lsakia tribe rest and sleep here in their few idle hours. 
The space is also oft-used to meet with emmisaries and discuss trade, as
well as entertain guests.  To the north, a path leads from the encampment
while eastward the tough grazing fields spread.  Westward, the ground raises
slightly, forming a small, stony hill.

The uneven ground about you is blotched with patches of tough, brownish
grass.  The land here is uncracked, the earth apparently not baked into
hard, dry clay.  The grass grows stubbornly, obviously stunted, sunburnt and
dehydrated.  The air is dry here, little moisture making it over the
mountains looming in the west.  Clouds rarely pass through the sky overhead,
and seldom remain when they do.  The puffs of moisture are rapidly
evaporated by the burning sun.  Westward, woolen tarps provide protection
from the sun while the tough growth continues to the east and south. 
Northward, the plants rapidly thin.

This path winds through the cracked plains of the waste.  Deep ruts mark
this road, dug by years of caravan wagons carrying trade through the desert.
The air about you is dry, the moisture baked away by the fierce rays of the
sun.  Few clouds drift past the western mountains visible far to the west,
and those that do are quickly evaporated in the heat.  Vegetation is sparse,
little growing save the occasion thorny bush or defiant tuft of brown grass.
A large stone arch looms the the north, the path leading underneath it, its
unique shape having been sculpted by years of wind and sand.

dry here, little moisture making it over the mountains barely visible over
the western horizon.  Clouds rarely pass through the sky overhead, and

The ground is uneven, consisting of cracked, sunbaked clay.  The waste
spreads about you in all directions, a vast, unending carpet of sandy brown.
The air is dry here, little moisture making it over the mountains visible
over the western horizon.  Clouds rarely pass through the sky overhead, and
seldom remain when they do.  The puffs of moisture are rapidly evaporated by
the burning sun.  Little grows here, save the occasional thorny bush or
defiant tuft of brown grass.  A path winds through the plains to the east,
the rutted trail visible as a slightly darker ribbon of brown in the waste. 
The cracked ground becomes finer as the plains stretch south, eventually
dissolving completely into sand.

This path winds through the cracked plains of the waste.  Deep ruts mark
this road, dug by years of caravan wagons carrying trade through the desert.
The air about you is dry, the moisture baked away by the fierce rays of the
sun.  Few clouds drift past the western mountains visible far to the west,
and those that do are quickly evaporated in the heat.  Vegetation is sparse,
little growing save the occasion thorny bush or defiant tuft of brown grass.
The road continues north and south.  Far to the south, the cracked plains
seem to give way to an ocean of sand.

The ground beneath you consists of fine, brown sand.  The sandy plains
contine in all directions save west.  To the east, the sand begins to take
on a definate reddish cast.  The canyon tapers off into the sands to the
northeast, the foothills of the mountains on its opposite side stopping you
from going around.  The air is dry here, little moisture making it over the
mountains barely visible over the western horizon.  Clouds rarely pass
through the sky overhead, and seldom remain when they do.  The puffs of
moisture are rapidly evaporated by the burning sun.  Southward, a path winds
through the sands.

Fine, red-tinted sand shifts below you, spreading to the south and east.

A small inlet into the foothills, the rocky walls rise up in all
directions save east.  Above you, an overhang of rock juts from the rising
mountains.  The high hills and overhang provide shade in the daytime, making
the place a haven from the burning heat of the waste.  Tufts of brown grass
grow in the sandy ground, becoming thicker as the path leads back into the
plains.  
A small opening is set into the rock to the west.

The wooden walls of the wagon have been covered with beaten cotton
tapestries of vivid red and yellow designs.  A cot lies at the far end, and
two benches jut from either side of the broadside walls.  Soft pillows lie
upon the benches and cot, providing a modicum of comfort.  From the slightly
arched roof hangs some form of glass container.  A door is on the wall
opposite the cot, leading out.

The chamber is large, a roughly circular construct of dark, white-veined
marble.  Six columns, each equidistant along the walls, rise, arching to
support the remains of a domed ceiling of the same material.  The walls are
cracked, and the columns likewise damaged.  The dome is partially caved in,
the stone that poured through the ancient wound covering part of a runed
arch.  Upon the walls, faded and cracked murals are carved between the
pillars, save to the south, where a massive arch opens into a passageway.  

The air is stale here, and the feel of antiquity hangs heavy upon this

This massive hallway, easily large enough for a tall humanoid, is carved
of a dark, white-veined marble.  The passage is cut off abruptly to the
south, the path having long ago collapsed under some unknown weight.  The
cave in seems also to have carried through the floor of the passage, rending
a hole in its floor.  The passage also opens into a large chamber to the
north through an arch.

You stand in a massive chamber of cyclopean dimensions.  Circular in
shape, walls of white veined dark marble rise into a massive, buckled dome. 
The stones of the floor radiate out in a circular mosaic, and large statues
line the edge of the room.  Each statue is that of an alatharya.  While most
are shattered and cracked, a few still stand in perfect condition.  Rubble
and debris from the walls, ceiling and the shattered statues litters the
floor.  A gigantic door stands broken on the northern wall, gilded bronze
doors hanging partially open to allow an avalanche of rubble through.  The
skeleton of a large humanoid lies nearby the doors, long since decayed.  

A fine layer of dust covers everything in this chamber, as well an eerie
stillness.  The feel of antiquity hangs heavy upon this chamber, the stale
air almost stifling.

This large room is made to feel almost cozy by its contents.  Both the
western and southern walls are consumed by empty bookshelves of some dark
wood, perhaps a foot or two of smooth, grey stone above them.  Inset into
the dust-covered black marble of the floor is a device of some sort in
white, partially covered by the trio of couches and large, low table in the
centre of the room.  Along the north wall is a small, abandoned bar, a
garish tartan displayed between the racks.  A small fireplace is set in the
northeastern corner of the room, far away from the now-empty shelves.  The
room is well-lit during the day by a quartet of skylights, and at night by
several brass lanterns set with balls of pure white light.  The eastern wall
is mostly unadorned, save for a few knick-knack shelves midway up the wall,
and an opening leading outside.  Another opening leads into another room to
the north.

The chiseled stone walls are barren apart from the torch sconces that
line the perimeter, each set with their own respective candle.  A dim glow
has been cast by these lights, bathing the room in an almost palpable
shimmer.  The floor has been paneled with softwood pine, a fine layer of
sand having collected on it.  An opening in the cave leads southward.  A
statue sits within the center, the only remarkable feature within the whole
of the room.

#ED_KEY statue
#BEGIN_ED_DESC
#ED_DES Carved from a marble of the most brilliant white, the statue stands about
six paces in height, and slightly less than four across.  The light of the
room hugs itself around the statues curves, and reflects off the smooth
porcelain surface, giving the stone a delicate lustre.  A solid rectangular
marble block acts as the foundation of this statue. 
   
Stone rose petals litter the base of the statue, carpeting the area with a
sea of delicate curves. Each of the individual pieces has been meticulously
shaped by hand, the finer lines of some of the petals apparently visible.
Shadows weave in and out along the edges, forming jagged lines on an
otherwise even surface. On and on the floral deathbed stretches, mainly
undisturbed save for the winged horse-like figure that stands above and a
small wolfs skull seated to the far right.
  
The Pegasus itself is perched upon its hind legs, with both forelegs raised
victoriously out in front. Framing its body are obsidian skeletal wings,
each fanning out discordantly in every direction. The body of the beast has
seen better days, with each individual rib clearly accountable for, and a
limp mane that hangs in a disheveled heap along its slender neck. The ears
are pressed against the side of its head, and the lips are folded back in a
garish display of teeth. Its eyeless head is turned to face the doorway, a
look of abject terror the welcoming sight for all who visit.
  
A small brass plaque hangs to upon the side of the base, with two simple
words etched upon its surface: "The Hunted."
