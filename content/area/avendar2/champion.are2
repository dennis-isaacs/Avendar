#NAME Akraelyn Champion emeritus trainer train ctrainer gladiator
#ALIGN 500 0
#DESCRIPTION A man of middling height, Akraelyn stands resolutely before you.  Broad
across the shoulders, with well defined muscles, his thick arms are crossed
with faded scars.  His dark, weather-worn skin is covered loosely by a
coarse, short-sleeved tunic.  Thick bands of iron are wrapped about his
forearms, each one engraved with the sign of the Sapphire Spear.  Quiet in
appearance, he carries himself like a hunted beast, his wary eyes ever
searching over the surrounding area.  

Closely cut locks of unkempt, greying hair frame his hardened face.  The
shadow cast by the tired strands falls over a noble brow, which looms
majestically over his clear green eyes.  Thick, grizzly stubble lines his
resolute jaw, giving him a rough and disheveled appearance.  Once-full
cheeks have grown thin, enunciating the authoritative aspect of his chin.  

Now retired from his legendary career, Akraelyn is still renowned for his
legendary exploits.  A man who began life in the slave pits of Ashta Harrud,
he escaped to walk the lands of Avendar as a Champion and follower of
Jolinn.  In time, he came to be leader of his Order, and guided the Tower of
Aramril through the turbulent years marking the rise of the Coven of the
Shunned.  From facing the dread Tzet-Sabanthe to his travails in the realm
of dreams, he proved his mettle time and again as battle leader.  Now, he
has returned from wandering Avendar as leader emeritus, and trains young
Champions, putting them through their paces here in the tower garden.

But indeed, what can one really tell from a torch just by looking at it so
offhandedly?  One must take the time to appreciate the fine pine wood of
this stalwart torch, harvested by a blessed saw by a high priest of Jolinn
himself.  It was obviously stripped lovingly of its bark and leaves with the
utmost care and the most practiced of hands, the work worthy of a demi-god;
such is its perfection.  

The pitch itself is of the most stunning of quality.  Made from pitch,
plaster and linseed oil laced with faint traces of lavender for a pleasing
scent, any lord would be proud to bear a torch adorned with such.  No doubt
some magic was involved in its creation, so long-burning is the dark
mixture.  

Ah.  A pine torch.  And what a pine torch it is.

By following the chain of command stringently, a semblance of order will 
be achieved.  Battles will be fought more smoothly; ambiguity amongst the 
ranks will be minimized.  It is expected that every Champion adhere to the

#DESCRIPTION {WChapter 5 - The Chain of Command{n
                     --------------------------------
  
In order to be the efficient force that it is is, the Champions of Aramril 
must maintain a strict chain of command. Without this, there might be 
ambiguity as to what is to be done.  The resulting chaos might lead to 
defeat in battle.  To prevent this from happening, I will attempt to 
completely document how all militant actions should be carried out.  
  
An officer always carries out the commands of a superior officer.  A command 
may be questioned, but not publicly.  This should be done privately with the 
officer in question.  Regardless, commands are to be immediately carried 
out.  Officers are expected to consult their lesser ranked comrades, in hopes 
that an efficient plan of battle be formulated.  
  
Problems with a ranking officer should be forwarded to the General and 
the Chancellor.  This includes problems with commands that have been 
given. They may attempt to disregard the dispute, speak with the 
officer informally, or call a council of Champions.  The council of 
Champions is the most dire consequence of the three.  The decision to 
call council is the at the sole discretion of the General.  
  
A council of Champions is a formal affair; it is only used in the most 
dire of situations.  It is open to all Champions; all who are able to 
attend will be required to do so.  Firstly, the accused will testify
on his own behalf.  After that, he will be allowed to call witnesses
in his defense.  If the accusor is present, he will then be allowed to 
speak; if not, then the Lord General will present the case against the 
accused.

#DESCRIPTION {WCHAPTER 4 - Common Military Courtesy{n
                   ------------------------------------
  
Custom and courtesty have both a place and a purpose in the order of Aramril. 
There are a few methods of address and ceremony that you will need to learn. 
You will be expected to adhere to these guidelines, as through them, you will 
convey respect to your fellow Champions.  Read this chapter, and learn well 
its contents.  If you do so, you will find your time in Aramril much more 
efficient.
  
Firstly, we will consider the salute.  The salute is the most basic kind 
of knightly courtesy.  It conveys the respect for the person that you are 
saluting.  A salute is initiated by the lower ranking officer; if the 
officers are of the same rank, either may initiate.  A salute should 
always be returned.  It is very disrespectful for an officer to receive a 
salute, and not give one in return.  To properly administer a salute, an
officer stands rigid. The officer then places the right hand to the left 
forearm, and the left hand to the right forearm.
  
Secondly, there is the matter of address.  You will address a superior 
officer by their rank.  Knight so-and-so, Paladin so-and-so, etc.  
Officers of the same rank are to address each other as Brother so-and-so or 
Sister so-and-so, in front of Champions of the lower ranks.  Privately, 
they may address each other by name.  Higher ranked officers may address 
those of lower rank by name, though the title brother or sister is 
always considered more respectful.  Also, you may answer officers of a 
superior rank with the respectful titles "Sir" and "Ma'am".  
  
As was previously stated, these guidelines are just that:  guidelines.  In 
times of battle, or in situations that might be perilous, some or all of 
these formalities may be dispensed with.  It is expected that a Champion 
of Aramril will have the good sense to know when this be the case.  Through 
these measures, it is hoped that we might come to love and respect one 
another to an even higher degree.

#DESCRIPTION {WCHAPTER 3 - Behavior Suggestions for Each Rank{n
             ----------------------------------------------
  
Behaviour of the Ranks:
  
{YNovice{n: 
  
Novices are expected to spend much of their time in meditation about the 
tenets of Aramril, and in service to their brethren, following the orders 
of their commanding Knight and other authorities within the Tower, within
reason.  To be a novice is to reflect upon what it is to be a Champion of 
the Light, and what the future holds.
  
{YKnight{n:
  
To be a Knight of the Champions is to know what one should be doing and 
how one will best serve in the current situation.  Instead of meditation, 
a Knight should always be out of the Tower, and in amongst the general
populace, doing the good works of the Champions.  However, the Tower,
as always, serves as a refuge for when the Knight requires rest or 
protection.
  
{YPaladin{n: 
  
A Paladin of the Champions is always working to coordinate and direct the 
works of the Knights and Novices below him.  He may spend more time in the 
tower, working on plans and giving reports to the Chancellor and the High
General, but he will also perform all the duties of a Knight as he is able 
to.  Paladins are those who walk on the path of Righteousness, with little 
or no error.
  
{YChancellor{n: 
The Chancellor, being the highest ranked Champion appointed by a mortal, 
is held to the highest standard.  His assistance is always given to the 
High General, and his works to monitor and deal with matters takes high 
priority.  He aids the High General as his closest and most trusted 
advisor, and is often known for his great wisdom and clarity of vision.
  
{YHigh General{n:

#DESCRIPTION The title of Paladin is bestowed upon those directly under the command of 
the Chancellor.  They act as tacticians, formulating plans of battle, and 
seeing that they are acted out properly.  Paladins are generally very 
knowledgable adventurers.  A Paladin must be a good leader, as he or she 
will be called on to lead soldiers into battle.
  
A Knight is a Champion who has proven his or her mettle.  He or she has 
either been a novice for a long time, or has distinguished himself in some 
way.  The Knight is considered the most common type of soldier in the 
order they make up the backbone of Aramril's army.  Knights are capable 
leaders; in the event that a Paladin is not present to act thusly, they 
will do so.  As a Knight, one is expected to demonstrate the tenets of Aramril 
superbly.
  
The lowest rank in the tower is that of Novice.  The Novice is generally a 
new Champion.  Novices are directly under the command of the more 
experienced Knights; he or she has generally demonstrated his knowledge of 
the tenets, but has not borne the burden of time, or distinguished his or 
her self in some way.  Novices hearken: though you are the least 
experienced of the order, you are in no way insignifigant.  As a Champion 
of Avendar, you have found fellowship.

#DESCRIPTION {WCHAPTER 2 - Structure of the Champions{n
                --------------------------------------
The Champions are divided into several ranks.  These ranks are instituted 
in order that a chain of command be established.  The chain of command 
will be detailed in the next chapter.  Each position has its own 
responsibilities.  In this chapter, I will attempt to detail them.  It 
should be noted that guild standing has little to do with what position 
one attains.  Rank is attained only through merit.  
    
The highest mortal power in Aramril is that of the Lord General. The 
Lord General is chosen by a deity of the light; generally this would be 
Jolinn.  The General's word is law.
    
 When it comes to the conflicts that arise in the tower, the General is 
the final arbiter.  He or she oversees the overall direction in which the 
house will go.  The General is responsible for inducting new members, as well
 as giving them positions within the order.  The General is also responsible 
for maintaining relations with other houses.
  
The Chancellor is the General's most trusted advisor.  He or she is 
generally well respected and quite a tactician.  It's his or her job to aid 
the General in making the various decisions that affect the internal state 
of the tower.  Disputes amongst ranking officers are to be forwarded to the 
Chancellor, as well as the General.  It should be noted that the 
Chancellor is the highest power appointed by a mortal, in the tower.

#DESCRIPTION {WChapter 1 - Aramril's Purpose{n
                       -----------------------------
Hello, adventurer.  You've been honored with the opportunity to serve the 
light as a Champion of the Light.  As a Champion, you will be based in the 
Tower of Aramril.  In the tower you'll find fellowship with brothers and 
sisters of the same mindset.  The tower stands as a bastion against the 
darkness that threatens the world.
  
Your purpose in the tower is to carry out Aramril's tenets.  You're to see
that justice is served, mercy is granted, and courage never falters.  As 
you are a Champion, so are you marked out;  there will be those that hunt 
you simply because you are who you are.  Still, so long as you honor your 
oath, and enforce the tenets, Aramril will always offer you refuge.
  
The order of Aramril is a militant one; as all military orders, it has 
its structure and regulations.  I have compiled this manual in an attempt
to convey this information to you.  Read it and understand its content, 
for along with the the three tenets and the three commandments, this 
information forms the basis for the Champions of the Light.

second-floor circular walkway, terminating high above in a vaulted,
patterned ceiling.  Equally tall stained glass windows, no more than a foot
wide, run the entire height of the wall, filling the room with colored light
by day.  By night, a large, sunburst silver lamp hanging from the balcony is
lit.  A large fountain of carved marble sits in the center of the room, an
abundance of ferns growing in planters around its base.  A floor of polished

As given by Jolinn, Lord of the Sapphire Spear
 
As the tenets of our Order are three, so too are the Commandments divided.
 
I. Courage
 
1. Champions are expected to exemplify moral courage, always striving to 
behave in a manner keeping with their ideals.
2. Champions are required to challenge evil should it intrude on the Tower of 
Aramril. While not expected to perish foolishly, Champions are expected
to harry enemies so long as they walk the grounds of the tower.
 
II. Justice
 
1. Do not quarrel with a man, unless his heart be black, or he has done wrong
in your sight.
2. A Champion must try to correct injustice wherever he sees it. Whenever a
Champion witnesses an unjust act, it is his duty to attempt to correct the 
injustice.
 
III. Mercy
 
1. Always succor those free from the taint of evil when they are in need.
2. Always allow for repentance in one's foes -- but do not be blind to those 
who do evil.

#NAME Beside the Dome of the Sun
#DESCRIPTION This watchtower rises from a balcony, its top on level with the large,
golden-scaled Dome of the Sun.  The hide which wraps the Dome is enormous;
each scale is well over two feet long, polished like molten gold.  A golden
weathervane, styled like a pegasus, sits atop the very peak of the Dome. 
This watchtower is made from smooth wood, bound together with bands of
metal.  A canvas awning overhead keeps the worst of the sun off, though at
points during the day the glare from the Dome can be quite oppressive.  The
watchtower affords an uninhibited view of the Arien Plains, from Earendam's
stately walls to Var Bandor's squat, more pragmatic boundaries.  The Arien
River flows to the south, a silver ribbon on the horizon.  Wind flows past
you, strong and fast, with nothing to hamper its course.

#DESCRIPTION This is the gatehouse of the Tower of Aramril.  It passes several paces
through the width of the massive outer curtain wall.  The enormous blocks of
yellow sandstone, a warm and rich butter color, are fitted together without
any sign of mortar.  The walls curve upwards in a smooth barrel vault.  From
the center of the roof hangs a wrought silver lamp.  The spiked bottom of a
heavy portcullis of silver-ornamented steel is visible, kept open except in
the most dire of emergencies.  To the south, the Arien Plains stretch, vast,
grey, and dusty.  A flagstone path leads north out of the gatehouse, through
lush grounds, to the Tower actual.

Aramril soars into the sky to the north, its outer curtain wall standing to

springy and resilient underfoot.  A pillared, cloistered walkway surrounds
the yard to the north, east, and west, the square colonnade cool in summer
and sheltered in winter.  The outer wall of the Tower, built from pale
yellow blocks, rises tall and smooth on three sides behind the cloisters. 
To the south, the Tower itself stands high in the air, its golden-scaled
dome gleaming grandly.  A flagstone path approaches the Tower in that
direction.  

Five trees of varying height grow around the edges of the green-grassed
yard, shading and protecting it: to the north, an enormous sycamore.  To the
northwest, a small rowan and a holly grow together, and a glossy magnolia to
the northeast.  To the west a slender birch leans out into the yard, and to
the east, a humble dogwood stands.

#DESCRIPTION This covered walkway looks out through a row of pillars onto a grassy
courtyard.  A featureless wall stands to the west, built from the same pale
yellow stone as the roof and columns.  The cloisters form three sides of a
square around the open yard to the east - to the south, beyond the yard, the
inner Tower of Aramril rises high into the air, golden dome gleaming
slightly.  The cloisters continue to the north and south, and a small tree
grows in the ground just outside the line of columns.
