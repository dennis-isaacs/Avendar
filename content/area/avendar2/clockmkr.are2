#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
Ten many-jointed brass limbs arch from the twisted torso of the old
clockmaker.  Little is left of his skinny, hunched frame - from the base of
his chest downward, his body is a clockwork monstrosity.  Wheels and gears
turn where his abdomen once was, driving six long, clawed legs, which
skitter about as if with a mind of their own.  Melded with the stumps of his
shoulders are four further limbs - one pair ending in mechanical hands, each
with seven multi-jointed fingers, and another, longer pair ending in
scythe-like blades.  

The Clockmaker is grey-haired and wrinkled.  One of his eyes has been
replaced by a construction of lenses and whirring apertures.  In his
remaining good eye, a frantic madness gleams.

The Clockmaker's lovely young daughter, Constance, lies resting upon the

white silk, a shade paler than her smooth, milky skin.  Her flaxen hair
spreads across pillow, cascading over the lip of the bier.  The girl's
delicate hands hold an ornate wooden box closely to her breast.

impeccably attired in a pressed butler's suit, with a neat cravat and

#DESCRIPTION
A mechanical dog, crafted from various metals, moves about in a perfectly
life-like fashion, apparently under the power of its clockwork innards.  The
frame of the hound is of iron, which forms it ribs, flexible spine and
hinged legs.  Plates of brass cover parts of its legs and his
friendly-looking head.  A mass of whirring clockwork can be seen between his
iron ribs, its cogs and flywheels buzzing and its gears shifting as the
creature moves about.  The mechanoid has eyes of crystal, which gleam
brightly, and a segmented tail of brass which wags back and forth.

#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
Systems of gears and springs have been built into the joints of the
long-dead corpse of a woman to grant it a lurching, clumsy animation.  The
whirring clockwork hangs in racks from its formaldehyde flesh, driving
springs and belts which pierce the withered skin, to work in the place of
its dead musculature.  A hole scooped out of the side of its head reveals an
intricate, buzzing mechanism.  

The woman must have already been old when she died, with a bent, age-wracked
frame and long, whispy white hair.  The preserved flesh now sags in the
construct of brass and iron, and its head lolls about erratically with the
movement of the whole, casting its vacant, cataract glare about the room.  

It lurches back and forth around the south end of the room, its only focus
being the constant rubbing of its left ring finger with its purple right
hand.

diamonds.  A triangular-brimmed hat sits askew atop its wooden head, which
has been carved with a large nose and a cheeky grin.  The marionette's
strings trail from its arms, legs and head as it moves about, dragging along
a pair of wooden crosses.  A steel poniard is attached to its right hand,
which it holds aloft like a tiny rapier.

and fine strands of plaited gold serve as whiskers.

This clockwork boar is perhaps the simplest of the mechanical devices in

the base of its compact body, which is heavily-armoured in plates of brass. 
The boar's head is fixed rigidly to its body, and its porkine features have
been only crudely rendered.  However great attention seems to have been paid
to the sharpening of the two large iron tusks which protrude from its mouth.
The boar charges about the room at great speed, attempting to plow into any
living thing it detects.

Like its smaller cousins, this enormous specimen is covered from tail to

been cut in the crest webbing just above the neck, to allow the fitting of a
thick, iron collar, with a short chain pinned to the ground.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION This thick journal, bound in fine leather, contains hundreds of rough-cut
parchment pages.  On the front cover an emblem of a silver clock face is
emblazoned.  The tome appears to be full of a dense, spidery handwriting,
interspersed with sketches and technical drawings - most of it very
difficult to understand.  Skimming through the book reveals 8 legible
sections, which you can read with 'read journal <number>'.

#KEYWORDS journal1
#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Skimming through the journal, you come across many entries of a technical
nature - drawings, measurements, and discussions on this or that component,
and plans regarding what next to build.  Toward the end of the journal,
spanning a period of a few years, the writer seems to be focusing on a
single, magnificent creation.  It's impossible to tell exactly what, as the
drawings are quite complex and abstract, although it seems to be a massive,
room-sized time piece of some description.  As this work progresses, the
handwriting be becomes spidery, scrawled and hard to read.  The writer
seems to be becoming more and more obsessed.  The final couple of pages are
in clear handwriting again, and the entries become highly agitated and
fervent. They read as follows: 

The Dragon's Feast

Ah, recalcitrant time!  Have I not given you enough these past decades?  For
five generations my family have served you as the greatest clockmakers in
the world, and for sixty years I myself have been your herald and your
doomsayer.  Each clock I built was monument to your mastery of the lives of
men.  Each silver face, gilded hand, and pendulum of brass an acknowledgement
of the inevitability of your grasp.  Now my wife is in your talons - I could
not save her, though it broke my heart to watch Adele slowly die.  I have
given you all that is mine, but my daughter I hold back!  You shall not have
her! I shall master you, and bend your passing to my own will!  No longer
shall my creations merely gauge your passing, eaking out your flow in
meager, devastating portions.  I shall build a device that holds you, binds
you, and masters you.  Thus will Constance be saved from your claws.

Never will my little girl know the agony of age.  I too shall escape time's

This is a great day.  The Chronometer has at last been completed, and the
pendulum set swinging with perfect rhythm.  I can feel the very waves of
time flowing from the base of the tower, metering out every second within
its vicinity.  All who come near the Chronometer will feel its pull, and so
be drawn into whatever flow of time my masterpiece decrees.  No longer shall
fugitive time run free, passing with unrestrained abandon!  No longer will
it take away those I love!  Once time is tamed, we shall be safe from its

The Guardian has been completed.  It has the strength to hold the pendulum
still, and kill any who seek to move it.  It was not easy!  With supplies so
low, I had to scavenge parts from Constance's toys to complete it.  The
clockwork brain from that toy snake of hers, and an iron cog from the hound.
The music box has gone missing, which worries me.  But no matter!  No one
will make the connection.  As for the hound, well,it was the only creation
of mine which might have stood up to the Guardian.  And once Constance is
under the Chronometer's sway, she will no longer need its protection.  Until
then, I shall hide the hound in the caretaker's cottage so that she does not
find it broken.

carriage.  The vehicle looks like it may have once been quite fine, trimmed
generously as it is with ornate carving and gilded patterns.  Now its paint
is badly faded, and it seems to slouch slightly on its heavy, spoked wheels.
These wheels still look functional, and are held from rolling toward the
back of the carriage house by a set of wooden blocks.  

The doors to the carriage also appear to be working, allowing you to open
them and enter the carriage if you wish.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Upon closer inspection, this small, plush doll reveals itself to be a
lovingly detailed study in grotesquery.  The skin of the doll is of silk
stocking, the colours and contours of its face picked out with multi-hued
patches, while protrusions of crimson material form a bulbous nose and
cauliflower ears.  The clown's mouth is fixed in an absurdly wide grin,
drawn back into its face with deep stitchwork.  In conjunction with its
beady, black-stud eyes and tussock of woolly, green hair, this demented grin
imbues the doll with an air of severe mania.  The clown's clothing, though
once brightly-coloured and extravagant, are now age-worn and frayed,
revealing in many places the amorphous, white bulges of the clown's stuffed
interior.  Much of the left arm has been badly burned, revealing a charred
wooden under-skeleton beneath, and the soles of its little silken shoes are
covered with old soot.  

In the course of the battle, a great hole has been torn in the doll's torso.
Inside, surrounded by greasy, woollen stuffing, a small, wooden key has been
stowed.

   Indeed, it is that last vestige of honour which I hope to preserve

   a quiet grave beneath the forest eaves, but at least He will never 
   come for me. 

   So I have locked up the mansion for the last time tonight. If any now 
   wish passage, they shall have to ask my ghost for the key!

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION The ch'taren settled among men, whose empire
lies shattered. The other races, long secluded by
humankind, came forth to a new Renaissance.
Some learned of the ways of the aelin, and
brought forth their own creation - the magic of
Air, which sought no rule, order, or code, merely
meaning in its own chaotic existence. 

Thus, all six of the great elemental magics were
brought to Avendar. Men, in time, sought to form
again their empire, but found the world too vast a
place - Ethron inhabitants of forest oaks, Dark
winged nefortu dangling in their dark places,
and even the alatharya of yore were returned in
diminished form. 

Still, for a time men formed a Republic on the
main continent of their home, but, in recent times,
these alliances were sundered by the raids of the
Kankoran barbarians and their allies. This has
resulted in the city states we see today -
Earandam the grand, Var Bandor, and even Ashta
Harrud, desert capitol of commerce. 

All races today find more meaning in finding their
own niche in the struggle for power, rather than a
great gasp at one empire. The Houses of Avendar
reflect this diversification of thought among the
people of Avendar. Likewise, the Scholars'
Towers, were even the mages of void and spirit
exist in an uneasy detente. 

Moreso than any time in history, the world is a
wide place, separated by long distances, with
opportunity awaiting around every street corner
in the great cities. A time, where, perhaps, the
future belongs to those who would take it, and
dare to tread the Siege Perilous - a time for
adventurers.....

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Striking with meaning, order, and purpose rather
than out of blind rage, the forces of the Void
took cities, rather than burning them, and
corrupted them to their will. Mothers were
forced to offer their children as appeasement in
unholy rites, designed to serve the Things which
dwell beyond, some were kept as slaves, but the
cities under the sway of the Void lived, even if
they were more the corpses of cities than
anything resembling a living organism. 

The templars of water mounted counter-assault
after counter-assault. Some times, with success,
other times, with failures. For long 
years, the two sides held sway in a series of
enormous battles. With time, thought, the
Scholars of Water found their magic growing
weaker - the Things of the void had grown strong
on the flesh of the young, and pressed for more
mortal flesh. When all seem darkest, when even
great Earandam thought to send its children to
the aelin amidst the moutain, the unthinkable
happend in the ranks of the Void. 

Their dark rites prepared, their rituals chanted,
they brought forth not demons or other Things,
they brought forth instead the ch'taren. The
ch'taren, whether exiles from the world of
dreams or even the fabled astral plane, had used
the magic of the void against itself, and had
travelled into the Prime Material by means of
their gateways. 

Bringing with them large numbers and the magics
of the Spirit, they routed the dreadlord templars
of the void to their holes in the ground, where
those that served Fire waited, and picked off the
weak among them. Humans learned of the
freedom of the Spirit, and everywhere, cast off
their chains, and drove the fiends of the Void
back once more into seclusion. 

And, thus ended the War of the Night, where
men learned that the candle of hope flickers even
in the blackest of times.

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION And yet, the aelin were not the ones to come to
dominance after the war. The humans, their
passion driving them still, slowly grew in numbers
across the surface of Avendar, while the aelin
remained in their cities, lost in the intracicies of
their own life. 

Those humans not already devoted to healing
learned much of the ways of earth from the god
Iandir, who brought law once more to the hills and
valleys of Avendar. Men paused in their mad
growth, and built cities, homes, places of staying,
order, and protection. 

And thus, many thousands of years passed.
Quarrels came and went, but none so great as a
war to drench and entire world in Fire. And so it
was that the empire of the Humans subsumed the
entire world. And yet, the humans were drawn to
more than just the surface, and began their
explorations of the nether regions of Avendar.
There, they found the great cities of the
shuddeni, a race blinded by the night, but who
still saw much, and gloried in the horror of the
demon sultans who taught them. 

Here, human scholars went who wished to learn
more. Tortured they were by the shuddeni, but
some, a few, learned their ways. Combining the
ritual of the shuddeni with the ancient learning of
the humans, the discipline of the Void was born. 

Who can say why the gods suffer such things to
exist? Certainly, the gods of the dark revel in the
Void, the Things which inhabit it not always of
their own creation, but often after their own
heart. Certainly, what the Scholars of the Void
did was the antithesis of life, and everything
living, but the gods of light could not bring and
end to them without disturbing the balance of the
world. 

So it was, those humans who studied with the
Shuddeni waxed mighty in their counsels, and
taught the shuddeni much of the ways of war. The
shuddeni culture, grown stagnant in their
millennia under stone, was re-energized by the
promise of conquest above the surface. On the
blackest night, of the darkest day of the year,
the humans and their shuddeni allies road forth
from the caves of their dank abyss, to usher in an
age of Night the world had never known.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION In their midnight rituals, the srryn had learned
much of the ways of fire. Fire to burn, fire to
make their will be done - fire, to destroy. The
humans, always more keen of wit, seized the
secrets of the srryn fire shamans, cultivated
among their numbers the first Scholars of Fire.
Savage men, of an unholy taste for pleasure and
power, unleashed their magics across the surface
of Avendar. 

Securing the yoke about their fellow men, the
great Scholars of Fire also trained warlords, or
templars of fire, to command in battle with the
sword, and yet still reign destruction with the
forces of fire. Most of the races scattered
before the hordes of humans and srryn that
plundered all they found, but the aelin stood to
defend their cities, and forged an alliance to
fight to keep the humans at bay, lest the night
consume all. 

Cities were reduced to ash. Aelin died in droves,
using their already small collection of ancient
artifacts to drive the humans back. And yet, again
and again the humans surged forward. Quick to
breed, quick to die, the humans stood at the
verge of a destruction that would consume all. 

Fortunately, not all among the humans thought as
the Scholars of Fire. Small in number, but
present, were humans who sought meaning in
more than brute destruction. Groping blindly,
they sought to bring peace, to heal, to purify.
They craved a life spent in other activity than
blind devotion to an orgy of chaos and
destruction. 

Praying to the gods, they were answered. Jolinn,
Father of the Seas, Lord of the Sapphire Spear,
sent these brave few to seek the titans, who
dwelt high in the mountains, where they had
slumbered since the Sundering. Waking, they
taught the humans of the magics of Water, and of
the strength of the Seas. These humans
returned, and became the first of the Scholars
of Water. Born to bring healing to a troubled
land, their love of life quenched the inferno of the
fire mage's hate. With their aid, the aelin drove
the armies of Fire back to the swamps, where
most of the Scholars of Fire were put to the
sword. 

Thus ended what the chronicles tell of as the War
of Fire, when men nearly brought ruin once more
to the world.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION This sundering of the Magic released cataclysmic
storms of magic over the surface of Avendar, which
changed and alteried all that they touched. Of the
god's new children, vast changes were wrought,
some for good, some for ill. The aelin were
granted flight, and the gift of keen reason. The
caldarans learned wisdom, and were turned from
the night. At the same time, the brutal srryn
were born, spawn of languid swamp and foul
hearts. Beneath the earth fled the shuddeni,
blind minions of pure darkness, driven mad, some
say, by a love of much knowledge. 

The centuries after the Sundering of Magic were
dark ones. It was not until some hundreds of
years that civilization began anew, with the proud
selin and their cities in the skies. Striving,
perhaps, for a memory of things past, they
collected the artifacts of the ancient slatharya,
and built cities that at least faintly echoed the
glories of ancient days. 

And so it was the selin waxed powerful, the
srryn confined to their torpid swamps and the
shuddeni to their caves, and all others brought
into alliance with them. For a time, it appeared the
world would never again know such a destruction,
until, at last, the gods allowed a new race to
awaken on Avendar - the humans. 

The humans were taken by any and all things,
some easily swayed to evil, others relentless
paragons of virtue. Some claimed them akin to
gods, others to devil-spawn of the Void, others
still to reckless children. Nevertheless, the
passion that drove the humans lead them, at first,
into a reckless alliance with the brutal srryn.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION In the beginning, were the gods. Some to create,
some to destroy, some to taint, others to bring
hope, others to simply be. The gods, though, were
alone in the universe. Seeking a canvas for their
essence, they created the world of Avendar.
And, edged along ever so carefully by the gods
of creation, they created the alatharya,
first children of the gods. 

To the alatharya, the gods gave their greatest
gift - Magic. Magic to create, magic to destroy,
some portion of each of the gods' essences was 
sent to swirl through the prime material, creating 
the ether, the Quintessence from which mages drew 
their power.

As time passed, the alatharya waxed mighty. The
gods, pleased, began plans for other creations,
each mighty in their own way. But the Alatharya
were not content with the god's plans to make
others - jealous of the thought that other
children might bring the god's attention away
from them, and coveting the Quintessence, they
sought to steal the power of the gods. With their
mighty pyramids, and strange rites, their priests
and scholars came together one fateful night for
a grand theft. In their hubris, they sought to
steal the power of the gods for themselves, and
make of themselves Creators. 

But, alas, it was not to be. The gods knew of the
theft, and instead of invoking the power of the
gods, they invoked their deepest and darkest
wrath. All across Avendar, the great cities of the
alatharya were rent in blood and fire - their
libraries burned, their pyramids turned to
rubble, their homes driven to the four winds. The
revenge of a god is not a small thing, and the
revenge of the combined might of a pantheon can
level entire worlds. So it was that the Alatharya
were cast from their pinnacle as the mightiest of
races. No more would the minds of the Alatharya
follow the intracies of magic - nor would the
Alatharya do nought than strive for balance in
their day to day life, fearful of retribution for
their ancient crime. And, lastly, the gods
sundered Magic from its pure form into its
elemental components. Water, Spirit, Wind, Fire,
Void, and Earth did it break them, and forever
shatter the mortal dream of attaining the divine
through mystic arts.

someone contented with their lot in life - an impression which is
accentuated by the warm smile which graces her lips.  One of the woman's
hands is held lightly to her chest, as though to show off the elegant golden
ring - presumably a wedding band - which rests on her finger.  The painting

Silence greets you as you enter this circular chamber - not the ticking
of a single clock breaks the utter stillness.  However this chamber holds
the most fantastical array of clockwork marvels yet seen.  Impossibly
intricate clocks crowd the workbenches and walls, jostling lathes, mills,
racks of clockmaker's tools, alongside tools for carpentry and glassblowing
and metal-smithing.  Even a tiny smelting oven squats in one corner. 
Partially assembled toys, and the metallic limbs, heads, cog-driven innards,
and even a few complete mechanical beasts lie scattered about.  Yet not a
single cog turns, nor do any clockhands tick.  A palpable inertia thickens
the air.

Much further southeast, the land rises into a hilly country, at first
covered in forest, but soon bare and brown.  Low ridgetops roll away to the
east, and extend like great, long fingers toward lofty Mount Enrien, with
its head forever in the clouds, to the southeast.  Beyond the forest, the
hills look quite unsavoury.  The dark valleys between the bare ridgetops are

Their dusty expanse is completely featureless, save for the pale road which

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION A little way to the southwest, the dry, oaken forest which surrounds the

wide, still pool, surrounded by a murky wetlands.  A small, raised patch
seems to be free of the swampy ground on the west side of the pond, and here
an tiny, overgrown graveyard is situated.  

Beyond this depression, the land rises once more towards the road, and then
past a small village, apparent from the thin streams of smoke which rise
above the forest canopy.  Further still, the forest gives way once more to a
far more extensive wetlands - the infamous Fens of Juk'Euile, supposedly

to the eastern horizon.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION A thick forest of oak stretches a little way to the west.  You can see
the slight break where the Forest Road makes its way north to Var Bandor,
and beyond that a few signs of human endeavour.  A wide glade opens just
beyond the road, in which several people clad in greens and browns seem to
be training.  Further on, a triangular-roofed stone building peeks out from
above the canopy.  Yet further west, small tributaries of the Dantaron River
run through the forest, giving rise to a wood of vibrantly green, lush
trees.  And there, where the forest ends on the banks of the Dantaron, a
busy encampment of trappers can be seen.  

The Dantaron itself winds back northeastward from this point towards Var
Bandor, while further west it skirts the northern edge of a wide,
evil-looking fen country and the southern edge of a grey, ashen plain. 
Eventually the glimmering river fades into the haze of distance.  From that
haze, on the very horizon, rise the jagged Yargash Mountains, where, as the
stories would tell, Rahh-Nefor of the Nefortu burrows into the deepest
caverns.

#KEYWORDS spyglasssouthxx
#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION The first thing you notice as you turn the spyglass southward is a small
cottage, nestled amongst the blackberry and privet, just a little way from
the manor itself.  It appears to be a caretaker's cottage, and judging from
the spire of smoke rising from its chimney, is still occupied.  The path to
the cottage looks completely overgrown, although perhaps some passage might
still be found through the thick privet shrubs.  

Beyond the grounds of the manor, the Forest of Nendor seems to stretch on
forever.  The circular window of the spyglass skims across countless miles
of this undulating, multi-hued treescape.  Few features are visible beneath
the high, thick canopy of the forest.  Thin streamers of rising smoke,
perhaps from some small village, are visible to the southwest, and some way
beyond that is a dark, twisted-looking section of forest.  Even further
south a wide circle of standing stones can be glimpsed between the trees,
clearly a shrine or holy place of some sort.  Further to the west, a series
of hills rise from the forest, thrust out from the foothills of Mount Enrien
to the far southeast.  

As you scan further and further south, eventually the forest reaches its
end, giving way to a wide, brown savanna.  The thin ribbon of the road can
be seen where it leaves the forest, winding its way across the savanna on
its way to the desert city of Ashta Harrud, far beyond the horizon.

where the Dantaron and Aragol rivers meet, before flowing away toward
Earendam in the far northwest, through a furtile river valley.  Further
north, the Arien Plains stretch away to the horizon.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Focusing the spyglass on the cobbled streets of the city to the north,
your eye is caught by its vibrant activity.  The walled city of Var Bandor
sits where the Dantaron and Aragol rivers meet, and the Arien and Forest
roads make it an important hub of commerce.  Travellers of all types can be
seen in the streets, as well as vendors and merchants, and locals going
about their daily business.  

In the north of the city sprawl the slums - once an old and distinguished
part of town, it has been taken over by more nefarious elements, and its
dark, twisting lanes look quite unsafe.  A broad avenue divides the northern
and southern parts of town.  The avenue is lined with inns, and at its
center opens a broad square, paved with flagstones, and dominated by a large
marble water fountain.  Merchants and travellers throng the busy square.  

To the south of the square the city is divided, east and west.  In the
southeast stand many tall towers - fantastically designed, and built in
multi-hued stone.  Along the twisting streets of the Scholars' Quarter walk
figuresclad in magnificent, if sometimes absurd robes.  The southwest of the
city is dominated by several elegant mansions.  At street level, the cobbled
ways are lines with the shops of fine craftsmen and sellers of fine foods. 


Beyond the northern gate of the city, the pale ribbon of the Arien Road
stretches toward Earendam in the east.  Northward, however, the aperture of
the spyglass skims across countless leagues of brown prairy; the vast Arien
Plains, which march all the way to the forested foothills of the Brintor
Mountains in the distant north.

#DESCRIPTION
The dusty interior of this once-grand carriage is somewhat stifling.  The
decaying upholstery of the two facing benches has filled the compartment
with a cloud of fibres, suggesting that its doors have not been opened in
years.  The benches were once covered in luxurious red velvet, which is now
faded and tattered.  Intricate moldings line the windows and the frame of
the door, suggesting its former owner was a person of some wealth.  An upper
corner of the carriage is occupied by a thick, white spider web.  A windowed
door leads from both sides of the carriage.

A grassy clearing opens between the privet to the north and west, and the

to the east.  The cottage looks quite dilapidated, with boards missing from
the walls, and large sections of terracotta tiles missing from the roof.  A
narrow porch, bordered by a carved wooden railing, extends from the front of
the cottage, in the center of which is set a faded door.  A tunnel through
the privet extends to the west.

This circular, stone chamber is filled with a timekeeping device of
unsurpassed intricacy - an exquisite orrery, in which a minature, bronze
Avendar is surrounded by its celestial companions, all in perfect scale,
spinning, orbitting and precessing in their allotted paths.  The immense
astrolabe surrounds a tall pillar of complex machinery - a clockwork
structure replete with thousands of cogs, gears, levers and chains, all
whirring and spinning in unison.  Five shining clocks project from the
apparatus, marked with unfamiliar glyphs and sigils, each ticking away their
own obscure measures of time.  The tripod legs of the pillar stand astride a
hole in the floor, through which a huge pendulum hangs, its ponderous
oscillation driving the entire device.  

A stone staircase curves upward with the western wall to a hatch in the

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION The device is, at first, highly confusing to look upon, and its daunting
complexity eludes comprehension.  With further analysis.  However, the
magnificent symmetries reveal themselves.  The intricate orrery is a perfect
model of Avendar's celestial system.  Mounted on great brass wheels, driven
by a clockwork pillar, each planet, moon, ring and shell in the system is
represented in perfect, minature scale, each orbitting the spinning golden
orb of the sun at the center.  

Avendar itself is cast in bronze, and inset with lapis lazuli oceans.  Metal
struts extend from the planet, supporting the twin moons - Lunus of shining
silver, and Rhos of ruddy brass.  Two planets, of dull tin and green-tinted
copper, are set closer to the sun, while three huge planets of jade, pewter
and iron, each girdled by rings and moons, hang, stationary, farther out. 
Beyond the planets, five concentric brass rings girdle the entire system,
each marked with indecipherable runic scales, near the walls of the chamber,
and each set at a different angle about the plane of the planets.  

The brass rings rotate about their own axes, but also precess slowly,
mapping out incomprehensible swathes of time -- perhaps defining the very
ages of Avendar.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Focusing the spyglass on the cobbled streets of the city to the north,
your eye is caught by its vibrant activity.  The walled city of Var Bandor
sits where the Dantaron and Aragol rivers meet, and the Arien and Forest
roads make it an important hub of commerce.  Travellers of all types can be
seen in the streets, as well as vendors and merchants, and locals going
about their daily business.  

In the north of the city sprawl the slums - once an old and distinguished
part of town, it has been taken over by more nefarious elements, and its
dark, twisting lanes look quite unsafe.  A broad avenue divides the northern
and southern parts of town.  The avenue is lined with inns, and at its
center opens a broad square, paved with flagstones, and dominated by a large
marble water fountain.  Merchants and travellers throng the busy square.  

To the south of the square the city is divided, east and west.  In the
southeast stand many tall towers - fantastically designed, and built in
multi-hued stone.  Along the twisting streets of the Scholars' Quarter walk
figuresclad in magnificent, if sometimes absurd robes.  The southwest of the
city is dominated by several elegant mansions.  At street level, the cobbled
ways are lines with the shops of fine craftsmen and sellers of fine foods. 


Beyond the northern gate of the city, the pale ribbon of the Arien Road
stretches toward Earendam in the east.  Northward, however, the aperture of
the spyglass skims across countless leagues of brown prairy; the vast Arien
Plains, which march all the way to the forested foothills of the Brintor
Mountains in the distant north.  

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#KEYWORDS spyglasssouthxx
#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION The first thing you notice as you turn the spyglass southward is a small
cottage, nestled amongst the blackberry and privet, just a little way from
the manor itself.  It appears to be a caretaker's cottage, and judging from
the spire of smoke rising from its chimney, is still occupied.  The path to
the cottage looks completely overgrown, although perhaps some passage might
still be found through the thick privet shrubs.  

Beyond the grounds of the manor, the Forest of Nendor seems to stretch on
forever.  The circular window of the spyglass skims across countless miles
of this undulating, multi-hued treescape.  Few features are visible beneath
the high, thick canopy of the forest.  Thin streamers of rising smoke,
perhaps from some small village, are visible to the southwest, and some way
beyond that is a dark, twisted-looking section of forest.  Even further
south a wide circle of standing stones can be glimpsed between the trees,
clearly a shrine or holy place of some sort.  Further to the west, a series
of hills rise from the forest, thrust out from the foothills of Mount Enrien
to the far southeast.  

As you scan further and further south, eventually the forest reaches its
end, giving way to a wide, brown savanna.  The thin ribbon of the road can
be seen where it leaves the forest, winding its way across the savanna on
its way to the desert city of Ashta Harrud, far beyond the horizon.

#KEYWORDS spyglasswestxx
#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION A thick forest of oak stretches a little way to the west.  You can see
the slight break where the Forest Road makes its way north to Var Bandor,
and beyond that a few signs of human endeavour.  A wide glade opens just
beyond the road, in which several people clad in greens and browns seem to
be training.  Further on, a triangular-roofed stone building peeks out from
above the canopy.  Yet further west, small tributaries of the Dantaron River
run through the forest, giving rise to a wood of vibrantly green, lush
trees.  And there, where the forest ends on the banks of the Dantaron, a
busy encampment of trappers can be seen.  

The Dantaron itself winds back northeastward from this point towards Var
Bandor, while further west it skirts the northern edge of a wide,
evil-looking fen country and the southern edge of a grey, ashen plain. 
Eventually the glimmering river fades into the haze of distance.  From that
haze, on the very horizon, rise the jagged Yargash Mountains, where, as the

an tiny, overgrown graveyard is situated.  

Beyond this depression, the land rises once more towards the road, and then
past a small village, apparent from the thin streams of smoke which rise
above the forest canopy.  Further still, the forest gives way once more to a

east, and extend like great, long fingers toward lofty Mount Enrien, with

hills look quite unsavoury.  The dark valleys between the bare ridgetops are
impossible to probe from this vantage, and rumour tells of desperate bandit

The forest floor here consists of a network of shallow pools,
interspersed with small mounds of dry ground, from which grow the forest
trees.  Around each of the smooth-barked trees grow thick clumps of fern,
their drooping fronds playing in the cool waters of the wetlands.  

Just to the west a path strikes up, plunging deep into the thickest growth
of fern.  To the south the waters and soil mingle to form a reeking black
mire.

Vivid green slime covers the surface of this pond, fading to a russet
brown where the algae meets the the sticky, black mud of the bank.  It's
impossible to tell how deep the pond is, although from the tussocks of
swampgrass which protrude through the slime, it would appear shallow.  The
forest grows in thickly from the south and west, while to the east rises the
side wall of a small hut.  Away to the north, the ground becomes a clinging
bog of black mud.

The old carriageway continues south, passing between a pair of old,

and built into pinnacles some six feet high.  The gates themselves have long
since vanished, and all that remains of them are the heavy iron hinges,
bolted to the stone.  Thick ivy covers the gateposts, and the surrounding
shrubs almost completely obscure their presence.  To the south the path
continues through the trees, while on the northern side of the posts it
turns sharply west.

A rutted carriageway winds north and south here, between the trees of

buried in the mud which crowds in from the edges.  The leafy boughs of the
tall, slender trees hang over the carriage-way, forming a light tunnel.  To
the north the path passes some old gate posts, while to the south the trees
give way, revealing an ivy-covered manor house.

#DESCRIPTION
Looming above you to the south is an old, stone mansion.  The building is
two stories high, with a tall bluestone tower set into the northwestern
corner. Most of this front face of the mansion is covered with thick ivy,
blending the building with the surrounding forest.  Only a few patches of
lichen-ridden stone look out from the ivy, and shattered windows high
overhead peer blankly at the tree-tops.  The carriageway, which leads north
into the forest, turns east here, and disappears around the side of the
mansion. A set of heavy oak doors hang loose on their hinges to the south.

A high bluestone tower rises from the northwest corner of the mansion,

the forest, some score feet higher than the decaying roof of the mansion. 
The tower itself seems to be in better repair than the rest of the mansion. 
Its dark, blue-grey stone is less weathered than the granite blocks of the
mansion proper, but more obviously - it seems to be free of the ivy which
shrouds the rest of the building.  The surrounding forest grows thickly up
to the western edge of the tower, also blocking travel to the north.  The
mansion's front door lies to the east.

immediately behind this wall have collapsed into ruin.  A little way to the
east the carriage-way turns around the side of the building and heads south,
while directly to the west it runs past the mansion's front door.  The thick
growth of the forest blocks the way north.

#NAME The Entrance Hall
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
Once splendidly appointed, this large entrance chamber is now in a state
of ruin and decay.  Wooden beams from the high, exposed roof hang
precariously from their sockets, now forming perches for the birds of the
forest, which come and go through the broken stained-glass windows. 
Girdling the southern half of the room is a wide balcony -- now unreachable,
as its wooden staircase has long since collapsed, blocking a door in the
eastern wall.  Several clocks, of different shapes and sizes, hang from the
plaster walls about the chamber, or lie toppled in the debris of the floor. 

Double doors are set in both the north and south walls, while in the western
wall the door has fallen from its hinges, and a faint, tinkling music comes
from the room beyond.

can be found amongst the rubble on the floor.

tolling their bells at the decreed hours.  Some clocks also lie smashed on

#NAME A Dusty Sitting Room
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
The curving wall of the tower cuts through this room to the northwest,
giving it an odd, almost-triangular shape.  It is efficiently furnished as a
comfortable sitting room, with a couple of divans and a single armchair
arranged about the walls, all covered in dusty white sheets.  Against the
narrow segment of the northern wall, in the nook formed between the tower
and the eastern wall, is set a beautiful, gilded harpsichord.  A tinkling
music streams from the instrument, and its keys depress and rise again, as
though at the hands of an invisible musician.  

An open doorway leads to a large chamber to the east, and a closed doorway
to the south.

#NAME The Chamber of the Chronometer
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
This circular, stone chamber is filled with a timekeeping device of
unsurpassed intricacy - an exquisite orrery, in which a minature, bronze
Avendar is surrounded by its celestial companions, all in perfect scale. 
The immense astrolabe surrounds a high pillar of complex machinery - a
clockwork structure replete with thousands of cogs, gears, levers and
chains.  Five shining clocks project from the apparatus, marked with
unfamiliar glyphs and sigils.  The tripod legs of the pillar stand astride a
hole in the floor, through which a huge pendulum hangs into the chamber
below.  However, the entire orrery is still.  No cog turns, the clocks are
silent, and the pendulum hangs motionless.  The planets, moons and sun are
suspended as though frozen in an instant in time.  

A stone staircase curves upward with the western wall to a hatch in the
ceiling, and a heavy trapdoor of green-tinted metal is set into the floor.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION The device is, at first, highly confusing to look upon, and its daunting
complexity eludes comprehension.  With further analysis. however, the
magnificent symmetries reveal themselves.  The intricate orrery is a perfect
model of Avendar's celestial system.  Mounted on great brass wheels, driven
by a clockwork pillar, each planet, moon, ring and shell in the system is
represented in perfect, minature scale, all frozen in orbit with each other, 
and about the golden orb of the sun at the center.  

Avendar itself is cast in bronze, and inset with lapis lazuli oceans.  Metal
struts extend from the planet, supporting the twin moons - Lunus of shining
silver, and Rhos of ruddy brass.  Two planets, of dull tin and green-tinted
copper, are set closer to the sun, while three huge planets of jade, pewter
and iron, each girdled by rings and moons, hang, stationary, farther out. 
Beyond the planets, five concentric brass rings girdle the entire system,
each marked with indecipherable runic scales, near the walls of the chamber, 
and each set at a different angle about the plane of the planets.

A wide path has been torn through the forest here, as though by the

many cases, and low-hanging branches have been ripped from trees.  To the
west, a thick stand of blackberries lies in tatters from the passage.  To
the north is the rear of an old, wooden building, which seems to have been
the origin of the destruction, as a great hole gapes in the wall, and
shattered wood is strewn across the forest floor.  To the south, somewhat
downhill, stands another, larger wooden building.  A similar hole opens in
its northern wall.

just to the west, and stones lie scattered across the path, moss-covered and
half-buried in mud.  Further south the mansion is still largely intact,
although the walls are beginning to crumble.  The carriage-way passes
beneath these walls before reaching a smaller, wooden structure in the
distance.  To the east the forest presses thickly against the road.

#NAME Before an Old Carriage House
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
The overgrown carriageway comes to an end here, at the doors of a wooden
carriage house, just to the south.  The building was once painted red, but
has now faded and flaked to a pinkish-brown.  Many of the tiles of its
triangular roof have slipped, and lie scattered on the ground, and the whole
structure looks slightly lopsided.  A trickling stream of water flows under
the front doors, into the building.  To the west a cobbled footpath begins,
and winds around the side of the carriage house, toward the grounds of the
mansion.

#NAME An Old Carriage House
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
This simple wooden structure is designed to hold both carriage and
horses, though the two stalls for the latter stand empty.  The carriage
house is all of wood, with an earthen floor, and seems termite ridden and
fragile.  Several wooden tiles from the roof have come loose, leaving large
gaps in some places.  A thin stream of water flows beneath the large, double
doors to the north, through the carriage house, and beneath a furrow under
the southern wall.  

A large set of double doors open in the northern wall.

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS stream
#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION The trickle of water enters beneath the carriage house doors to the
north, feeding a few small pools on the earthen floor.  With the ground
sloping distinctly southward, the stream finally exits beneath the southern
wall, and into the forest.

#NAME In the Shadow of a Buttressed Wall
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
A path of white pebbles winds through some bramble-choked flower gardens
here, beneath the elegant row of arches which support the high western wall.
Clearly the wall of some great hall, it is lined with high, stained glass
windows, spaced between the buttresses.  The northern wall is lower, its
second story crumbled to ruin, and a leering gargoyle squats on its brink. 
To the east the path joins with a wider carriage-way, while to the south it
meanders into an overgrown garden.

#DESCRIPTION
A weed-ridden path of white pebbles winds its way from the north, before
turning westward.  On either side of the path the garden grows rampant. 
Veils of sprawling creeper, both red Nendorian woodbine and green ivy, drape
from a few ornamental elm trees, while completely shrouding several smaller
shrubs.  The garden continues in all directions but the east, where the wall
of an old, wooden building rises.

#DESCRIPTION
A narrow tunnel has been hacked through the middle of this growth of
privet shrubs, leading away south.  A thin veil of branches seems to have
been left to the east, to obscure the location of the tunnel.  The
intertwining branches of the privet bushes form a thick wall about the
tunnel, studded with dark leaves and small, delicate-looking white flowers. 
The fragrance of the flowers is heady and sweet, and washes thickly over you
as you pass beneath the thicket.

A path of white pebbles, muddy and overgrown, passes beneath the

two elegant flying buttresses, which arch over the garden below.  Woodbine
and ivy, mottled red and green, cling thickly to the stonework, forming
great veils with sway in the wind beneath the arches.  The pebble path
continues east and west, while to the south an area of the garden has been
