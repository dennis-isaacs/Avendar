civilized and more than one traveller lost in the woods has been aided by
these light-following creatures.

Beyond their dedication to helping those in their wood, and their ties with

 The Vesler Snake

Rumoured to live in distant swamps on another continent, the vesler snake,
also known as the one-eyed snake, has one of the most toxic venoms of any
land bound creature.  Used by alchemists and assassins of yore, just one
nick of a blade coated in the venom is said to render the victim paralyzed,
if not dead.  Those who have survived encounters with the vesler snake's
venom are often left blinded or retain partial paralysis.  Reliable
information on the snake is difficult to find, as the vesler was hunted
into near extinction, not only for its potent venom but also for its
beautiful blue shimmering blue scales, which are highly prized and priced
by any knowledgeable on the subject.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Opening the book to the first section, you read:

 The Blade of Varmein (The Blade of Magic)

Forged in times past the Blade of Varmein, or as it is more commonly
known, the Blade of Magic, was created by one of the ancient Alatharya's
greatest craftsmen and scholars.  What scraps of information remain tell
of years of preparation and powerful rituals the like of which modern
Avendar has never seen.  The end result was the Blade of Varmein, most
likely named after its creator, a weapon which contained the perfect meld
of magic and steel.  So strong was the force of energy put into this
blade that holding it was akin to holding a slice of pure magic.  Kept in
the ancient capital, it was displayed in their tower of artifacts as a
symbol of the perfect unity of magic and the material plane.

When the Sundering occurred, a terrible explosion tore apart the tower the
Blade of Varmein was kept in, as the blade was so pure that it was also
divided.  The explosion was so great that none in the tower survived
and nothing remained but a fine sand, the remnants of the stone of which
it had been built.  Rumours have circulated since that the blade remains
on Avendar this day, but in many pieces scattered throughout the world.
Myth and fairytale tell of six blades which united will again form the
ancient weapon, but those familiar with the subject believe a seventh
blade to be needed to unite the six, a center for the power to be focused
through.

As to what will happen if the blades are reunited, that is even more of
a mystery.  According to fairytale, the world will once again have access
to the pure form of magic lost so long ago.  Legend, however, warns of a
day in the future when the children of the Three seek to undo what They
have done, and merge the six powers into one once more.  This day, the
legends predict, will be the end of all that is Avendar.  Most who study
the histories doubt something so extreme and a few adventurers of past
have sought to find these mythical blades, though none have yet found
concrete evidence that the Blade of Varmein exists in any form at all.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Many years after the War of Night, when the Spirit Palace had become
fairly well established, it was noticed that some strange activity was
happening in the caves of Mount Enrien.  Unsettled by this, as it was
very close to the prison of the demon lord Kzroth, a few scholars were
sent to explore and establish what had happened.

In the mountain they found a group who referred to themselves as "Kohli"
and appeared to be the last remanents of a race which had lived for many
years deep underground.  Observing the kohli while invisible, it was
eventually deduced that some massive, evil creature had forced them from
their homes, and was responsible for their now sparse population.  The
amber dragon, upon hearing the details, realized it was the void dragon
Tzet-Sabanthe.  Knowing the pure corruption and evil that the dark dragon
was, the amber dragon sought it and drove it off, unwilling to allow it
to destroy an entire race.  The kohli, thankful and awestruck, came to
worship the amber dragon as their diety, and elected to stay in their
new city, close to their god.  It was not until sometime later that the
details of this were discovered, however, due to the generally seclusive
nature of the amber dragon.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION The Spirit Palace, in all its beauty and glory, has attracted many who
hate it for those it houses.  Between the six magics a balance has always
existed, keeping a peace that is understood by most powerful scholars.
Envy and hate cloud reason, however, and during the rule of the fifth
great Arch-Mage, Gaene Vosatair, dark stirrings were heard.  A group of
void and fire scholars broke from their guilds to create their own sect,
the Maevis'Hra, which loosely translates into "Bringers of Darkness".
Hoping to eliminate the presence of the golden light that is Spirit,
they performed many dark rituals, a twisted meld of pain and darkness.
Believing themselves strong enough to fight this small sect, the many
schools of spirit around Avendar prepared to defend themselves, and those
at the palace settled down for war.

To the spirit scholars, triumph was never in doubt.  The Arch-Mage,
however, had underestimated the Maevis'Hra and their fanatical devotion
to their cause.  The night the Maevis'Hra struck has been burned into
legend as the greatest tragedy ever to befall the scholars of Spirit.
All over Avendar spirit schools were besieged by scholars and their vile
demons.  The guild in Drellan Myr fell early, burned to the ground by
unnatural fires, and not leaving any survivors.  For the Spirit Palace
was saved the darkwalkers strongest ally, the demon lord Kzroth, a being of
fire and destruction.  He cut through the palace defences easily,
feasting on the bodies of those he killed, and growing stronger for each
one.

Knowing the demon must be stopped, or it would most likely succeed in
destroying the palace, Arch-Mage Vosatair went out to fight him alone,
giving his body up to become a true avatar.  By giving all his soul to
his transformation, he became more powerful than any before him, burning
up his own life energy.  The battle between the Arch-Mage and Kzroth was
long, but eventually Kzroth was weakened enough to be trapped.  The
remaining Maevis'Hra fled at his defeat, and Kzroth was locked in a
magically warded cell within the mountain.  When the cell was closed,
the Arch-Mage fell and as the consuming light dissipated, so did he, until
nothing remained of either.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION The Spirit Palace was first suggested about a decade after the magics of
air had been let loose upon the land.  Realizing the destructive force
of pure entropy, and the seeming weakening of the barrier between the magic
of air and the prime material in the clouds around the ancient Mountain
Enrien, a young human scholar suggested a place of work and magic be
built nearby.  Not only would this palace serve to watch over the beings
of chaos that roamed this energy-charged place, but it would also be a
symbol of the strength and hope that spirit magic itself represented.
The young man, Heclan Nayber, would become the first Arch-Mage of the
Spirit Palace, and its first leader.  Always wise beyond his years, his
decision was oft proven a good one as time progressed.

This large room is for young spirit mages to train and test themselves in
their newly learned spells, and to sometimes stay the night if what they
need to learn will take more than one session to grasp.  The walls raise up,
made of some sort of material the seems a cross between white marble and the
misty clouds outside.  A small table and chair made of the same material sit
against the far wall, and off in the corner a white bed stands, looking
comfortable and warm.  The whole room glows with light, whether a residue of
practiced spells or by design, it is difficult to tell.  A single door leads

depicted are either human, ch'taren, or ethron in hertitage.  It is strange
that the founder of the spirit palace was a human, but he looks wise and

#DESCRIPTION
This room belongs to the librarian's assistant, his possessions few and
scattered throughout the room.  A comfortable bed is set against the west
wall, but most of the room is dominated by a huge bookcase filled with a few
books, mostly a large collection of figurines.  Besides the extensive
collection, there seem to be little else of personal value in the room.  A
small door leads south into the tower, and a window looks out north to the
world of Avendar below.

#DESCRIPTION
The room is suffused with light, both from the walls, and from the
windows looking out towards each of the four compass points.  North you can
see the vast realm of Avendar spread out like a beautiful carpet, from the
green forests of Nendor to the distant blue sparkle of the Uthlin Ocean. 
West the shimmer of a bridge of mist catches your eye, and east lies a view
of the opposite tower, glowing in the sunlight.  The arch-mage can overlook
all of the cloudy world the spirit mages live in at the southern window, and
a desk sitting infront of the window indicates she does just that.  The room
is sparsly but richly furnished, and the only exit appears to be the
twisting staircase leading back down the tower.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Looking out the window, you see the soft, eternally calm white clouds
around the spirit palace.  The creatures of light that have made their home
in the clouds pass in and out of view, as do various scholars from the
palace.  The areas seems perpetually filled with light and peace, giving the
aura of calm to all who pass through.
