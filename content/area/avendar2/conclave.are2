seeing to their dicipline and training with a harsh, iron fist.

#ALIGN -500 0
#DESCRIPTION The Heart of Arisuth, Alhalis is the unquestioned ruler of the Conclave
by the will of Isetaton, Demon Sultan of the Void.  A mighty scholar of the
void, Alhalis rose to power decades ago within the tower.  By making pacts
with the demons of the Maze of Flesh he was able to solidify his position,
gaining the infernal powers of Isetaton for an inscrutable price.  

Alhalis was once darkly handsome, but close association with the powers of
the void have eaten away at him.  His hair is grey and wispy now and his
pupilless white eyes bear dark circles, but the most horrific result of the
touch is the maw.  Taking up the entirety of his upper torso, a great
wide-fanged maw gapes.  Surrounded by feverish and ropy grey flesh it
gibbers and chants, its yawning teeth revealing the darkness of the void.

#DESCRIPTION A humanoid shade of purest black hangs in midair here, a pair of great
unflapping inky wings arching from it.  It reflects nothing, instead
appearing to be a simple void of existence.  The shade appears to be the
midnight reflection of an angelic female when viewed from an angle, but even
this is difficult to tell, as the very being disappears into itself.  The
only thing to break the darkness of the tenebral being are a pair of
gleaming eyes, like molten gold, gazing hungrily from the void.  

An unnatural chill surrounds the void shade, as well as a tangible aura of
frustration.

His head is shaven and a pair of square-lensed spectacles rest on his face. 
His eyes bear no pupils, oddly enough, merely milky orbs.  He doesn't seem
sightless, however, as he tends to his paperwork.  He seems relaxed and at
ease in his position, an easy smirk pulling at his lips now and then.  

One of the only scholars in the tower who does not focus the majority of his
studies to the void, Suzahme rose to his position through donations, both
monetary and literary.

#DESCRIPTION Viara Malz, the Voice of Arisuth and Speaker for the Heart, is a
stunningly beautiful human woman.  Appearing to be in her middle years, time
has only added to her regal, mature beauty, rather than diminishing it.  Her
hair is a deep black that tumbles down about her shoulders and face in lush,
glossy curls.  Her face is fine-boned and delicate, with a pair of brilliant
green eyes set below her narrow midnight eyebrows.  Her full lips seem
curled into a faint smile as her eyes flash in a predatory fashion about her
surroundings.  

She is clothed from neck to ankle in a form-fitting dress of exceedingly
sheer black fabric, leaving little of her supple, well-endowed figure to the
imagination.  A hole fashioned into the dress reveals the skin of her
midriff, and about her neck she wears a necklace of thin platinum discs.

#DESCRIPTION Standing over eight feet tall, this insectoid syndic of the demon
magistrate Khamurn is well suited to its normal duties in the defense and
organization of Khamurn's court.  The demon has a sticklike, insectoid body,
complete with four independent arms.  Covering its body is a hard green
exoskeleton, and prehensile pincer-like hands are located at the end of each
of its lanky arms.  

Along with its blood-red compound eyes, the syndic has an impressive bundle
of antennas sprouting from the two nodes on its head.  The creature is
largely free of superfluous motion, except the constant twitching of the
antennae in response to otherworldly stimuli.  It wears no formal armor, but
is draped in fine purple silks of its office.  Each of its arms bears either
a sword or a shield, which it holds at ready.

#DESCRIPTION "The Conclave of the Arisuth"

The Arisuth formed after the pall of the War of Night had lifted from the
world above and the stigma of Void Magic had lifted enough for guilds to
form.  

The guilds of the void found themselves beset by suspicion in the wake of
the war, and could not easily conduct their dark studies without scrutiny or
violence.  The leaders of the guilds met in secret and concieved of a remote
location that they might continue their experiments unfettered by the moral
concerns of others.  

Distance was no object to those who might rend reality and step through
countless leagues with a thought, and in the heart of the Mlejian Mountains,
the Conclave was built.  

The Void Guilds pool their research and resources within the tower under the
oversight of the Heart of the conclave; the supreme scholar within the
tower.  The Speaker for the Heart speaks his will to those who are beneath
the Hearts presence, which is all save the Speaker.  

The remote nature of the Conclave allows us to achieve great works without
the meddling of other guilds.  Within these Mlejian Mountains we are
unassailable.  The old trails are blocked by landslides and gating is the
only practical manner of travel to us.  

Our studies shall test the void and the veil.  Let none stand before Arisuth
and the Guilds of the Void.

#DESCRIPTION Chapter Three: Black Swells- The Result of Ripple Interference.  

There have occasionally been reports of aberrant results to rituals and
spells involving the void.  While many are the results of inept handling of
compenents or mispronounciation of an incantation, several incidents can not
be so simply explained away.  It is believed that when several powerful
ripples meet, it can cause a turbulance of sorts within the void, to
oft-unpleasant results.  Many cases of mispossesion and missummonings have
been credited to such.  Incidents of void scholars being stuck within the
other body and negation of personality are discussed in length in a treatise
by one of my contemperaries, Rzkakiz.  

Missummonings are noteably less common, but usually more dramatic.  Jyraka,
a high wizard of the Yithoul tribe, reportedly attempted to summon a runaway
slave back to the temple.  Despite a reportedly flawless circle, the spell
went awry.  The result was the chaja being summoned into her body, the two
merging into a formless mass.  The resulting dissection showed the bodies
had indeed fused.  At the time, no less than 3 nexuses had been opened
around the cavern.  

The chapter continues, giving many more gruesome examples of failed
summonings.

#DESCRIPTION Chapter Two: Demonic Resonance- Could Demonic Summoning be Refined?  

It is theorized that certain ripples resonate with the inhabitants of the
void.  The incantation sends out a ripple that beckons demons to enter this
realm.  The apparent randomness of demonic summoning suggests that these
demons are all clustered approximately the same distance away from the veil.
One wonders what may lie beyond the simple demons we now call.  Perhaps if
were able to somehow delay the effects of the ripples, or make them
undetectable to certain beings within the Void, we could find greater powers
to bind and call forces with more accuracy 

The summoning of Greater Demons is perhaps an example of this.  Have we
incidentally hit upon a way to slip the resonating ripples past the weaker
powers of the void?  If we have, how deep do we penetrate?  Are we ignoring
other demons between the lesser and the greater?  Many questions are raised.
With the refining of the summoning process, answers might be found.  

The chapter continues, giving forth proposals to streamline the summoning
process.

#DESCRIPTION Chapter One: The Dark Pond- The Void Ripple Theory.  

It has been surmised that the channeling of the void for the purpose of
casting creates ripples within the space of the void.  While many of the
lesser castings, simple maledictions and calls for knowledge, cause
insignificant disturbances, other more powerful incantations create
noticable ripples.  

For the most part, these ripples have little effect upon our craft.  It
raises interesting possibilities, however.  If this proves true, it may
allow for the detection of other spells cast by fellow void scholars.  Some
have said that the true reason for the harmful effects of the spells of
'gate', 'nexus' and 'phase door' are due to the disturbance caused by the
ripples of the casting.  I suspect this to be untrue, however.  The effects
of remaining within the void upon living matter would most likely be
detrimental.  There have been reports of people cast into the void while
under magical observation.  The subjects were reported to suffer no ill
physical results, but began to gibber madly.  They soon began to repeat some
incomprehensible phrase in desperation before they were apparently unmade. 
The claim that no physical harm was incurred is interesting.  Perhaps
survival within the Void would be possible, if the mental degeneration could
be avoided.  

The chapter continues, putting forth ideas on survival within the void.

#DESCRIPTION {WVoid Shades, a Treatise{x by Molodr Felpawn, Void Magus.  

To travellers within the void, and the summoners of its denziens, the void
shade is a familiar sight.  Black humanoid or animal shades that flit
noiselessly through the murk and drain the warmth from their victims with a
chilling touch.  Their origin however is not well known, and may come as a
notable surprise to dedicants of the dark magics.  

Void shades are the spirits of those sacrificed in the black ceremonies of
the void, their souls consigned to a hellish unlife beyond the veil.  It is
through our very works that they are created.  Certainly the animal shades
are the most plentiful, so often do they fall under our ritual knives, but
their faint spark of spirit makes for a weak beast in death.  Humans
sacrifice is less common, but humanoid void shades still stalk the void with
their quicksilver eyes.  

Rarest of all is the greater void shade, the tormented and trapped spirit of
a celestial being of the spirit trapped within the darkness.  Precious few
of the beings have been subdued and slain in ritual slaughter.  Those
spirits that become shades are the most terrible of all this manner of
creature.  Their golden eyes seek release, and will throw themselves into
battle without provocation.  

If there were some manner to bind such creatures, what fearsome allies they
would be!  For now, we research our materials, signs and spells for the key
to breaking them to our will.

The advantage of stealing the life force of your foe is obvious, but best
used in supplement to a strong defence.  Evenly matched against a
swordmaster foe, the noted templar Ilae retreated into a defensive
swordform, and took up a cursed whip as her secondary weapon.  The leeching
effect of the whip proved the deciding factor in the battle of attrition as
her foes life supplemented her own.  

{WBlade of Vershak{x

The use of the Vershak blade is obvious, of course, extra strikes always

poisoned blade striking many times would weaken even the strongest foe in

After slaughtering one of his rogues for good measure, the forces of light
were no match for that hellish blade.

Potent void templars are often forced to match blows with santuary-protected

of Vershak blades makes its use a notable surprise, especially when the
switch comes unexpectedly.  The potent Benakk, hounded by goodly water
templars, bound the defilers into his spiked gauntlets.  When his own axe
was chilled from his grasp by his templar foe, his mailed fist punched
through the white aura, stunning the templar long enough for Benakk to
regain his advantage.

"..  I sleep no longer.  My own grand cunning has trapped me in a most
exquisite hell.  My pact with Isetaton, the Demon Sultan of the Maze of
Flesh, eats at my mind and forfeited soul.  The sacrifice of vanity was
necessary for my rebirth, this demon-toothed maw that squirms in my chest
but the first taste of what awaits me, but it was not the last.  

My potent magics and my vasty void-bargained might have put paid to any who
would oppose me and Viara my faithful bound servant sets my minions against
each other that they strike not against me, but all is not well.  It chants
now, when I slumber, and visions of the Maze of Flesh dance through my
dreams like whence I first laid eyes upon the hellish symbol in my youth. 
It drives me, now, down.  To the alatharyan ruins buried beneath the desert.
Isetaton seeks a way into this realm, to craft a grand CATHEDRAL of FLESH
from the composite meats of avendar's beings.  He DRIVES me to DIG.  So I
send my minions to scry the sands for the means of his release.  Of a temple
in the sands to birth HIM into this plane.."

#DESCRIPTION The Tower and Symbolism.  

By Master Vorgnen, Mason and Architect

Since the gods granted the gift of thought to the races of Avendar, they
have built hovels, then homes then great palaces and towers.  Towers are
symbols of enlightenment.  Of a yearning to reach a greater plane, to touch
the divinity of the gods overhead.  The Ancient Alatharya sought this, and
were cast down for their arrogance, but yet still the races build.  

The tower seeks the heavens, and is a passage to it.  The tower is a symbol
of ascendance.  Why build a mean, sprawling complex, low to the earth and
stable, when you might dream toward the heavens?  The ch'taren spires
gloriously reflect this.  Their beauty befitting of a race of dreamers.  The
aelin too seek the sky, but such beings are born to touch it.  Flying
cities, they crafted, soaring over the plains west of the Lidreau sea.  

The shuddeni best illustrate my point, I believe.  If the goodly races build
toward the encompassing heavens, toward what damnation do those eyeless
wretches beneath the earth dig?  

What, then, is the meaning of a tower of darkness?  Is it a challenge? 
Arisuth is a creation of unity between the civilized forces of the void.  Is
the tower itself a symbol of unity between the heavens and the hells as well
as earth and sky?  All these questions bear thought and consideration.

#DESCRIPTION On Combating the Magics of the Spirit.  

Powered by the foul powers of goodness, the magic of spirit templars and
scholars has proven a thorn in our side since its introduction to our plane.
Let us recall the day of Two Dawns!  Blast them!  Those scabrous whelps! 
Those golden-skinned upstarts!  Who are they to stand in the way of our
destiny?  Why, on their entire race a pox...  

(This rhetorical ranting continues for several pages before the author's
vitriol is spent on the subject of his hate for the ch'taren race.)  

Despite their despicable nature, they won the War of Night.  They defeated
us with their spirit magics, but why?  The answer lies in the nature of our
arcane defenses and their inherent weakness.  The cloak of the void and the
form of the wraith fend off all damage save that of a holy nature.  They
make us, in fact, more vulnerable to the accursed magics.  Even the fearsome
demonic possession of a void templar renders him weak as a babe to blessed
assaults.  They can unbind our demons and turn them against us!  They can
call on more mana when we siphon theirs!  Their blessings protect them from
our maledictions!  Their true-sight can pierce our walk of the void!  

We can combat this, however.  Here is a list of ways we can overcome their
assaults- 

(The paper mentions something about superior numbers, but trails off into
colorful and violent ways to take revenge on the ch'taren as a race.  The
remainder of the book does not seem to offer any practical advice.)

crest of a wide, curving staircase.  A carpet of deep, solid purple lies
upon the floor, following the grand hallway.  The vaulted ceiling rises into
the darkness, supported by runed pillars built into the dark walls.  At the
base of each of the inscribed pillars, a onyx-decorated silver brazier
burns, causing shadows to dance across the hall.  At the far end of the
hall, a large set of ebony double-doors stand, dark runes seeming to swim
blackly over its surface.  Inset in the east wall, by the staircase, is a
door of dark ironwood.

black stone, seemingly the same as that which forms the tower, is set into
the western wall and an ebony door lies to the east.
