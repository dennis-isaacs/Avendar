perhaps the most difficult to attain.  It is the means by which the people
of Avendar are organized and inspired. 
The basic application of Leadership is the chain of command. A Crownbearer
must recognize authority at all times, and remain obedient to those in 
command.
 
The Ranks of Crownbearers are as follows, from least to greatest:
Ranks of the Iron Crown:
Initiate
Soldier
Ranks of the Silver Crown:
Keeper
Knight
Ranks of the Gold Crown:
Lord
High Lord

Trust is the basis of Leadership.  Subordinates will not follow one they
do not trust.  The trust of another is a difficult thing to build, and
often may only be gained by demonstrating that one may be relied upon.
A Crownbearer may demonstrate his Reliability by remaining steadfast in
all things he does.  Those who place themselves in your command must not
find this Trust betrayed, either by deliberate betrayal, or by incompetent
leadership. If a party agrees to follow a Crownbearer, then meets his doom
through the leading Crownbearer's foolishness, Trust is destroyed and the
