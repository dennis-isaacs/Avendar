shimmers and casts multicoloured rays at odd and unnatural angles.  A jagged
rift in time and space, the thing is about as wide and tall as an alatharya,
but the borders constantly fold and contract, making the true perimeter
difficult to judge.  Powerful forces tug at you even looking at the thing,
and bits of dust in the air around it are quite definitely being drawn into
its depths.

#NAME Rage
#DESCRIPTION Around are the shambles of what used to be a beautiful room.  The
furniture is now little more than kindling, spread around the room.  The
shreads of curtains hang from the lone window in the room, the glass that
was in it shattered and lying on the floor.  A small fire has been started
on one of the piles of furniture, and the stench of gasoline lies heavy in
the air.  The one object remaining intact in the room is a large queen sized
bed, covered in thick dark blue blankets.  Upon closer examination, you
realize the corner of the bed has been drenched with some dark liquid that
looks suspiciously like blood.  At the rate the fire is growing, it doesn't
seem the bed will be left for much longer.

#DESCRIPTION Spluttering sheets of glistening, mountain water cascade over the edge of
a stony crag far above.  At the base of the falls, the water dashes into a
series of jagged steps and breaks into a layer of fine mist, hovering above
a foaming, serpentine strip of fast-moving rapids that broadens out as it
makes its way east.  The river itself marks a clear point of delineation
between the lush, verdant lands to the south and the barren scrublands to
the north.  The Dantaron's waters lap quietly onto the flat, barren surface
of the north bank, providing life to a scant handful of twisted scrubs.  On
the opposite end, the waters smash against a looming cliff wall, resplendent
with overhung ferns and vines, that forcefully curves them back towards the
north.  A narrow crevice can be seen in the southern cliff face, obscured by
a swath of overhung vines.

#NAME A Mountain Lake
#DESCRIPTION This clear mountain lake is the source of the River Dantaron.  Filled by
melting snows and soft rains, it is a clear blue, complete with sandy
bottom.  Surrounded by rocky outcroppings, the lake is set in some sort of
caldera, blocking off the view of the surrounding terrain in most
directions, but the river does pass through a break in the rocks to the
east, where you can make out the sounds of a waterfall.  Further to the
west, the lake continues.

#NAME The Aragol River
#DESCRIPTION The Aragol river runs swiftly over shallow rocks and small, dark pools. 
To the west, up against the banks of the river, there are trees and brush. 
It is dark between the trees, and a shadow of a cloud moves across the
leaves.  Vast plains stretch out on the opposite side of the river, and far
away, far beyond the plains, rise mountains in the sun.

#NAME The Aragol River
#DESCRIPTION The river slows into calm eddies and easy currents as it passes over deep
salmon pools.  The trees to the west thin as they near the banks of the
river.  There is a slight chattering from somewhere within them.  On the
opposite side, the plains are broken by fields of high grass.  They bend and
weave with the winds.  Beyond the plains, there is a distant line of
mountains.
