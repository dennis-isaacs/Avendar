In fact, each breath he expels seems to darken and contaminate the

colour of your blood, swing at you, in unthinking rage.

#KEYWORDS  chessboard board
#DESCRIPTION Carved of rock and then painted to the appropriate colours, the
chessboard seems sturdy enough to survive the most drunken of players.  The
rock has been roughly carved and shaped into the pieces, little detail added
beyond what was needed to make the distinction between the different
positions.  The only difference is the king of each set, carefully and
intricately done to look like a large dragon, the wings of both painted
amber.

There are some wooden benches infront of the statue.  Polished to a warm
gleam, for the worshippers of this dragon to sit on as they contemplate. 
West lies the main room of the temple, seeming dull and drab in comparison
to the dragon's inner light.

#DESCRIPTION You are at the base of a large fountain, brimming with fresh, clear
water.  It seems to be one of the few very ornate things left in Kohlis,
leading you to believe it was here before the earthquake.  There are many
Kohli clustered here, some getting water from the fountain, some just
enjoying a break.  The bustle of the market is in all directions but west,
where the main road lies.

arches high, with murals of a large amber dragon, and different impressive
looking Kohli, most likely ancestors of the Lord.  The sculpted
candleholders are spaced evenly along the walls, each holding a white
candle, the fickering light illuminating the area well enough to see, but
lending soft shadows to the harsh stone.  The beauty of the murals and
carvings along the wall is marred by the pile of stones lying to the north,
cutting off the rest of this majestic room.  Wide double doors lead back
south, to the main hallway.

parallel lines.  The lines are harshly drawn, and are of uneven length,
similar to the markings of some great claw.  Unwholesome runes and glyphs
dot the points of the star, carefully offset from the lines.  

This mark pulses with a blasphemous power all its own.  Perhaps you could
learn more were you to study it.

#DESCRIPTION You gaze at the Mark of the Damned, examining with care the fine lines
and gouges making its form.  Even as you do so, you feel the world about you
waver and fade..  

You find yourself floating within the void, surrounded by nothingness. 
Soon, the nothingness takes form, appearing as wraithlike figures with
quicksilver eyes.  The lost spirits beckon, whispering promises of knowledge
and power, carressing you with limbs of wispy cold.  You find yourself
moving, if such can be discerned in an unchanging landscape, and after what
seems like an eternity you arrive at a blackened gate hanging in the
nothingness.  

Here your chilling escort fades, but the whispers remain, as well as shining
pinpoints of silver light.  They call for you to step through, to become one
with the power of the void.  You hesistate, and begin to float through. 
Whether this is by your will or that of some malevolent force is unclear. 
You pass through, and all becomes light.  

White fire rages about you, blinding you with its sheer intensity.  Tongues
of flame envelop you and you can feel your flesh blacken and flake like
burnt parchment.  You can not even scream in agony as the very air is burnt
from your lungs, suffocating you even as you are consumed..  

The light fades suddenly, and you find yourself again in Kzroth's chamber,
the Mark of the Damned seared into your memory.
