#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
A beautiful dark-haired woman stands assertively in front of you.  Her
firmly muscled body is well-proportioned for fighting and holds a deadly
sort of grace.  Her steel armor holds a menacing beauty to them, and were
obviously crafted by a divine hand.  The black steel with silver trim
provides a startling contrast to each other.  Her eyes are the lightest
blue, and have a somewhat cold quality to them, as if they were filled with
tiny ice chips.  Her gaze when she looks upon a person is frigidly
calculating and solemn.

Dilasem is approaching his elderly years with grey hair that is slowly

muscles and unyielding appearance suggests he is still well able to defend
himself.  Twenty years before Dilasem had achieved a glorious reputation by
leading a phalanx of the Invincibles in a border war.  His valor and courage
had won him the rank of Lieutenant amongst the Invincibles, and the sigil of
the Hammer of Steel.  Now in retirement, Dilasem has chosen to spend the
last of his years near his god, and to spend time training the active
members of the Invincibles.

gray robes without any adornments or embroidery.  Nehruin, while not a
member of the Legion of the Invincibles, has taken it upon himself to take
care of his temple.  He orchestrates the many other priests into making sure
that the temple grounds are well cared for, and that nothing goes awry. 
While the task is large, and the material rewards small, Nehruin goes about
his duties with a calm acceptance.

Larent, once a thief amongst the shadows, has dedicated the later part of
his life to the service of Dolgrael and to the study of the water magics. 
While not one of the legion of Invincibles, Larent serves the temple by
acting as the public greeter to all those that wish to enter the temple. 
Approaching his sixties now, Larent still has a bit of the arrogant
dominance he used to carry with him as a youth.  He has also kept his old
daggers with him, tucked within his belt, as a reminder of his past.

Mirellen, stands just a few inches above five feet tall, with long blonde
hair that reaches her waist.  Her age is indeterminable, but her eyes
sparkle with an intense dedication to her fellow comrades of the
Invincibles.  Mirellen often visits the cave here when she is not on active
duty to the legion so that she may take care of Dilasem in his elderly
years.  Though she might often berate Dilasem for training so hard even at
his age, privately she is happy to see that he still has the fighting spirit
that made him so famous amongst the Invincibles.

#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
Standing just a bit over six feet in height, Akatheian exudes an aura of
leadership and charm.  Hawk-like green eyes are framed by dark ebony
eyebrows.  His hair is tied severely into a small braid that just barely
reaches his shoulders.  Slightly sunken cheeks, along with highly structured
cheekbones, suggest that this is a man who does not care to indulge his own
physical needs.  While Akatheian's confident stance and demeanor further
enhances his aura of command, it also illustrates his already tall, but
thin, body.  An almost perpetual half-smile is evident on his face, except
those few times that something or someone manages to anger him.  Akatheian's
hands are hidden underneath a constant pair of black leather gloves.  The
hilt of a blade can be seen showing, though the rest of his blade is hidden
underneath his cloak.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION The second maneuver of the Way of the Vermillion Fires is the Crescent
Blood Blaze.  I am ashamed to say that I took savage delight in my youth in
the terror this caused my impending victims.  Nowadays, I realize that this
Way should be used in honor, and not simply for torment.  Ones success in
mastering this maneuver can be seen when one can summon execute a crescent
strike that will forth the legacy within the axe to stain one's opponent.  

To understand this way one must first say to oneself that For Good Or For
Ill The Legacy Of My Foes Stain The Path Of My Ways.  Without such

Then one must Duck Low While the Axe is held Downwards.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION I scribe the secrets of the Vermillion Fires down so that my
accomplishments will not be forgotten, and in the hopes that one day a
successor will use what I have developed in a more honorable way.  Perhaps
that will cleanse some of the shame I now feel for my past actions.  

I have no name now, for I have given up my name along with my axe.  But
years ago I participated in a great war, and in this war I killed countless
people with my axe.  Many of those I killed were my opponents, and I regret
those killings not, but many more of those were but innocents: women and
children, and for those actions I am ashamed.  But as all their blood ran
red before me and my axe, I was able to develop a style of fighting which I
have labeled as the Way of the Vermillion Fires.  

For a long time I had thought to let the secrets of the Vermillion Fires die
with me, especially those first days I took refuge here after the war.  This
past decade though, I have spent here within the hallowed Temple of
Dolgrael, and I have realized that a weapon is not inherently evil, but
guided only by the intent of the wielder.  Thus I have written that which I
know, and trust it, as well as my axe, to the keeping of Captain Vashel.

though no bartender, sits in the southern corner.  Most of the room is bare
and empty.  Only in the northern corner do you see a table with several
chairs around it.  The room is badly illuminated with no windows and only a
few lanterns that hang from various places on the wall.  Back to the south
you see the murky portal from which you entered from.

#NAME A Crudely Dug Cave
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
Inside the hill is a crudely dug cave.  It appears to have been hollowed
out shovel by shovel, as hinted from the rough marks and scars on the
earthen walls.  Thick tree roots form the veins of the walls, giving it a
very textured look.  On the floor of the cave grows various small weeds and
plants, indicating that the cave was not just excavated recently.  The whole
cave has the look of being constructed out of a simple necessity, and not a
need for comfort or elegance.  A pile of refuse is piled neatly into one
corner, obviously waiting to be disposed outside.  A small stone lever comes
out of the wall by the entrance of the cave.  To the east and west are small
recesses that further widen this cave.  To the south is a wider area, where
the earthen floor and walls has been smoothed.

while PUSHing the lever would probably cause it to open.

In this recess the eastern earthen wall has been hollowed out to form a

necessities range from a single unlit tallow candle, to some simple homespun
clothing that is folded neatly into each alcove.  A few pieces of wood lie
on the floor here, sitting next to a flint and steel.  A modest hole, now
covered by a blanket of grass, has been dug into the ceiling, allowing any
smoke from a tiny fire to escape the confines of the cave.  To the west the
cave broadens, with the opening to the outside in that direction.

The searing red and blue fire burns around you in all directions,

physically, but more blazes into your very soul.  To the north you can dimly
make out through the fire, a colossal smithy where the clang of hammer
against anvil comes strongly.  To the south comes the faintest wisp of fresh
air, promising and end to this punishment if you can reach it.

Built, it appears, in the heart of a mountain, the colossal smithy of
Dolgrael rises high into the heavens.  Beautiful masterpiece pieces of armor
and weaponry line the walls of the forge, giving off auras of beauty and
deadliness.  A large ruby red marble anvil, over ten feet tall and over
thirty feet wide, dominates the center of the room.  A blazing blue inferno
dances within an enormous furnace built into the mountain.  You can also see
an unadorned granite well, filled with cobalt blue water, close to the
anvil.  A simple steel throne is rooted to the mountain floor, by the side
of the anvil.

#DESCRIPTION
Here upon the fields of combat the blades of grass are silver in hue. 
The grass is kept strictly at a short length, allowing a person to travel
through it without any impediments.  The uniform silver color of the grass,
however, is shaded by the light from the sun that pierces through the
vermillion clouds above.  The blanket of clouds appears to hang low in the
sky, giving this overall field a reddish hue.  A silence hangs in the air as
you note that no animals or insects of any kind seem to live upon these
battlefields.  To the south one can make out a few tents that are clumped
together upon the plains, while to the east and west there appears to be two
small lakes of clear blue water.

#DESCRIPTION
The crystal clear blue waters of the lake here are marred only by the
reddish light that comes through from the vermillion clouds above.  The
clear water allows an observer to see to the deep bottom of the lake below. 
Periodically, small ripples race across the surface of the lake due to the
slight winds.  Other than this the lake appears to be undisturbed by any
fish or other creatures.  No reflections can be seen upon the surface of the
water, almost as if the water chooses to ignore the fleeting and ephemeral
objects and beings that dwell outside of it.  To the west and south the
silver plains begin, and one can see two obsidian columns that support the
crimson portal standing out of the grass to the west.

Upon the plains here have been erected a number of large and small canvas
tents, which though empty, form streets and patterns much like that of a
small village.  The light coming through the vermillion clouds above give
the tents an unnatural coloring, giving off shadows of pale red.  It is
obvious that such formations are used to simulate the feel of an actual
village, or as means to train for urban combat.  No efforts have been made
to decorate these tents to further the illusion of being a village however,
almost as if the people who erected them disdained of the need to do so.  In
all directions around, one can see the plains of silver grass continuing,
though to the north you can make out the two obsidian columns that support
the crimson portal.

the contact and wear between the limestone and the water does not appear to
leave any traces within the water, leaving the water here as clear as the
lake water.  The passageway is fairly dark, due to the fact that no direct
light can reach through the layers of rock overhead.  To the east and west
the passageway continues to either of the blue lakes.

#NAME Within the Limestone Tunnels
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
The winding limestone tunnels continue as they wind their way beneath the
fields of combat above.  The tunnel is fairly large, allowing for several
people to move through at the simultaneously.  The limestone rock of the
walls is rough and appears to be weeping a faint sheen of moisture, leading
to the occasional soft sound of a droplet of water colliding with another. 
Periodically a breath of air drifts through the tunnel, but does little to
alleviate the overall sterile environment of the place.  To the north the
tunnel begins to slope down as it leads to a lake, while to the west the
tunnel goes onward in darkness.

#NAME An Island Within the Sky
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
You are currently upon a jagged piece of land that is floating in the
skies like an island in the middle of an ocean.  Beneath you, one can view
the clouds as they drift past at a swift pace.  Intermittently some birds
can be seen flying through the clouds, periodically visible through the
breaks in the clouds.  The island itself appears to have been a piece of
white marble mixed with vein of silver that was forcibly torn from the earth
and cast into the air.  The surface of it has been polished to the extent
that it is possible to see ones reflection by gazing at it.  A silver
fountain pipes crystal clear water in the center of this area.  To the north
are two large obsidian columns bearing arcane runes that support a crimson
portal between them.

#DESCRIPTION
The earth here has been excavated long ago as part of a series of mine
shafts.  The earthen walls are rough, and one can see the buried roots of
various plants intertwined with the soil.  The musty air within the tunnels
attests to the fact that these mines have long since been abandoned. 
Strange foreign glyphs can be seen at measured intervals, further evidence
that these mines were dug centuries ago.  The mineshaft diverges here in
three possible directions, the north, the south, and the west.
