#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
The eldest member of the knighthood, Irionne the water scholar now serves
the order as priest of Enaerai and healer of the knights.  He is reknown,
though some might say infamous, for the many services rendered to the order,
especially for his role in the Guardian Conflict and the destruction of the
temple in Earendam where he served many years.  Despite the years that
clearly weigh upon him, his brown eyes twinkle from the recesses of his
wizened face.

the gatehouse provides the primary access to and from the fortress.
A raised metal grated gate hangs to the west, the spear-like
points at its bottom glistening dully.  A small, narrow staircase winds
its way around the pulleys and weights that control the gate, and ascends
to the top of the wall.
  
To the east, the main gateway to the fortress is open.  Not far from the
wall, a ravine stretches north and south, spanned by a slender stone bridge.

stone, and their armor glimmers softly in the light of the Commons Room.  

Across from the Champions are the pawns of the Shunned.  A myriad of cloaked
figures, the faces of the Shunned pawns are barely visible.  When viewed
from below, you can see that each figure is a shuddeni, srryn, or nefortu

dress.  

The Queen of the Shunned is a human woman with flowing red hair.  Lilisa
stares coldly across the chessboard, her hands clasped behind her back.  Her
eyes are inset with rubies, giving her a fiery appearance.

and Eintras holding a tall, gleaming white poleaxe.  

The knights of the Shunned are a pair of past Ravens, Rasniel and Shasarik. 
Rasniel is a nefortu who holds a pike and spreads his wings protectively
over Lilisa, who is to his right.  Shasarik, a srryn barbarian, is shown in
heavy black armor, and holds a book in one arm and a long Reaver of Souls in
his right hand, and the thick black Scale of the Void Dragon shield in his
left.

the ch'lonin sword and wearing a gleaming ring engraved with a feather. 
Sidaleth, a male caladaran earth scholar, stands tall before a bulky earth
elemental and wields a heavy wooden staff.  

The bishops of the Shunned are a pensive pair.  On the left is Yurhari, an
aelin whose wings are thin and bat-like.  His face shows many signs of age,
but his pose is that of a young man.  Vaeshir, a shuddeni draped in a heavy
black cloak, grits his teeth menacingly and holds up a hand, which is
wreathed in a carved halo of wispy void magic.

dreadlocks and nearly reaches to her waist.  Pfusch holds a log to her chest
with one hand, and wields a dual-pronged trident in her left.  At the
opposite end of the chessboard is an aelin woman who wears the mark of the
Sapphire Spear.  Ilisaela glares out imperiously, holding a tall spear.  

The rooks of the Shunned seem to be a mismatched pair.  At the right is
Kirasect, an angry-looking nefortu whose hands cradle a small nova made of
ruby.  At the left is a black-cloaked shuddeni.  Azithalaju has a smug smile
on his face and his eyeless gaze surveys the chessboard coolly.  He holds
the staff of Memang at his side protectively.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION On Restoring the Balance
by High Lord Tessolos


  "The Knights of Enaerai seek to uphold the balance in
   Avendar.  By persuasion or by force, and acting as a
   unified military body, the Knights are ever vigilant
   that no extreme influence disrupts the equilibrium
   and natural balance as created when the three great
   powers first brought Avendar into being."


When the balance is in jeopardy, what action must Knights take? The lines
above, penned into the Code by Orlin the Founder, serve as a guide.
Knights present in the realm, under the direction of any leaders also
present, together are sworn to act against the imbalance and set it aright.

It is known that the wandering guild adventurers offer the greatest
potential for destabilizing (and rectifying) the balance.  And so it is
primarily upon the adventurers of Avendar that the Knights must focus
their attention, doing all in their power to drive forth those who disrupt
balance, and to encourage and strengthen the lesser side of the scale.

In some cases, persuasion suffices--those who would remain friendly the
Knight Order may choose to depart rather than be driven by force.  Many
a time bloodshed may be avoided through discussion, or making other
sorts of arrangements or agreements (with those who would hold true to
such agreements) that also bring the scales back into proper harmony.

But more often, force is required, and thus we are organized into a
military body, to maximize effiency in that regard.  Those who resist
the efforts of Knights, to depart the land or face the blades and spells
of the Knight Order, choose for themselves.  It is known that the ghosts
of mortals weight but little, if at all, upon the scales, and so the 
duty of the  Knights is clear with regard to force.

That is not to say that a Knight is required to suicide against a
superior force, for that would not accomplish the goals of the order, 
and is foolishness.  But in such a situation, the Knight would of 
course be actively working, strategizing, and doing everything within
his or her power to strengthen the force or element opposing the imbalance,
and preparing himself or herself to be able meet the imbalance 
with sufficient force to drive it from the land.

Knights who see no easy way to rectify the balance, and then turn to
their own needs and desires--guild advancement, seeking honors, glory,
or gold and items of power--dishonor their vows, unless such actions
will clearly and directly aid them in preparing for and battling
the superior force.

I have known of Knights who have, with the balance in jeopardy, 
gone upon their way, working toward guild advancement and 
otherwise neglecting to give heed to the work of restoration.
Such faithless and callow fools all eventually wind up the same--as
oathbreakers, outcasts of the order, and hunted by the true
servants of balance.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION THE SIGIL OF ENAERAI


Knights receive the sigil of Enaerai, a mark depicting the Eye of
Enaerai symbol, when they first take the oath of Knighthood upon
themselves.  For some, particularly those Knights who would find
themselves within the division of the Mett, the sigil may not be
visible, but exists nonetheless.

The sigil grants Knights a small measure of protection from holy and
negative powers, as well as a slight increase of combat abilities.
It also assists in communications among the Knight Order.  Knights
may speak to each other in the following manner:

 knighttell <message>  or kt <message>

Those who wear the sigil can also address a note to all Knights by 
doing the follwing:

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION USE OF THE SCALE OF ORLIN

The Knight Lord is given charge to care for and instruct Knights in the use
of the Scale of Orlin.  The Scale of Orlin is a complex instrument, only
understood by those dedicated to Enaerai and in the knight order.  It
measures the balance between good and evil, between law and chaos, and
between the strength of the houses.  It gives priority to the measure in
that order, as should the Knights.  The scale is used in the following
manner:

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION NAMING A RENEGADE KNIGHT

Only the Knight Lord may declare a Knight to be renegade and oathbreaker. 
Normally, Knights accused of oathbreaking are given warning and an
opportunity to defend themselves (in a simple court, as directed by the
Lord).  The naming of renegade is a last resort, to declare to the Knight
that their mortal life, which is sworn to Enaerai, is forfeit.  When a
Knight is judged to be renegade, and is present in the realm, the Knight
Lord uses the oathstone in the following manner: 

renegade <name>

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION DEMOTING AN OFFICER OF THE KNIGHTS

For whatever reason, if a leader among the Knights is to be demoted or
returned to standard Knight status, the administrator, before the oath
stone, asks the Knight whether they accept the removal of office.  The
Knight must respond "I accept" (and should be so informed), and then the
administrator binds the act through use of the oath stone, as follows:

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION ADMINISTERING THE LORD OATH

At least two Knight Captains must agree on the candidate for the Knight
Lord position, and the prospective Knight Lord given the oath by another
Captain, for the oath ceremony and granting of rank to be considered 
valid before Enaerai.

As with the other oath ceremonies, the candidate stands in the gold ring,
before a Knight Captain.  The candidate is formally charged with directing
the Knighthood and taking responsibility for the balance of Avendar before
Enaerai.  The Captain then questions: "Will you accept this charge?" 
The candidate must respond "I will" (and should be informed beforehand that
those are the necessary words to be uttered, for the oath stone to bind the
ceremony).

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION ADMINISTERING THE CAPTAIN OATH

Traditionally, the candidate for the captaincy stands in the gold ring
before the Knight Lord (or another Captain, in the Lord's absence).  The
candidate is formally charged with directing and upholding the work of the
division they are to direct.  The administrator then questions: "Will you
pledge to faithfully serve Enaerai and the balance as Knight Captain?"  The
candidate must respond "I will" (and should be informed beforehand that
those are the requisite ceremonial words that must be uttered, for the oath
stone to bind the ceremony).

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION ADMINISTERING THE KNIGHT OATH

The worthy applicant traditionally stands in the gold ring before the Knight
Lord (or Captain, in the Lord's absence).  The applicant is questioned
regarding their desire to take the oath, whether it is done of their own
volition, and whether they understand the consequenses of breaking the oath.


If the applicant gives satisfactory answers, the adminstrator of the oath
questions: "Will you take the oath upon yourself now?"  The applicant must
respond "I will" (and should be informed beforehand that those are the
proper ceremonial words, without which the oath stone will not bind the
oath).

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION THE KNIGHT GUARD

In the temple of Enaerai, a Knight stands guard at the doors of the
compound.  He will permit only Knights to pass the doors, and those the
Knights wish to invite within the compound.  If Knights wish to invite
someone into the compound, they may say the following: 

escort <name>

The guard will alert all Knights when others attempt to force their way into
the compound, and will also attack renegades of the Knighthood on sight.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION THE PRIEST OF ENAERAI

In the temple of Enaerai in Earendam, a priest tends the altar.  He will
also occasionally grant his blessings and spells upon Knights who are in the
temple.  

Like most temple priests, he can heal for a price, but he'll also grant
benedictions and heal wounds for Knights, of his own accord, and when his
duties permit.  

The priest will also hold items for the Knights, though he will drop
artifacts of great power (such as the Stones of Power) as such items have
the potential to influence the balance and should not be in the temple.  

If a Knight wishes to request the last item given to the priest, the Knight
may do the following: 

request

Finally, when a Knight prays in the presence of the priest in the temple,
the Knight will be able to discern whether Enaerai is near to the realm of
mortals and the prayer is heard, or whether she is distant.  If she is
distant, the priest will take note of the prayer, and Enaerai will receive
the prayer at a later time, when she once more draws near to the mortal
realm.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION THE CODE OF THE KNIGHTS OF ENAERAI

The Knights of Enaerai seek to uphold the balance in Avendar.  By persuasion
or by force, and acting as a unified military body, the Knights are ever
vigilant that no extreme influence disrupts the equilibrium and natural
balance as created when the three great powers first brought Avendar into
being.  

The Knights revere Enaerai, who is held as their guiding deity of balance,
though no active worship is required throughout the Order.  They also
observe Mettenday, the first calendar day of every month on the standard
Avendarian calendar, as a day of rest, recuperation, and assembly.  No
efforts to actively enforce balance are made by the Knights on Mettenday. 
The Knights are based in the city of Earendam, in a compound adjunct to the
Temple of Enaerai.  

REQUIREMENTS OF KNIGHTHOOD

Adventurers who are neutral in both alignment and ethos may become Knights
of Enaerai.  However, scholars who practice the greater spells of spirit or
void, and templars of those spheres, may not seek entrance to the
Knighthood.  To join the Knights of Enaerai, seek out members of the order
and petition them for entrance.  Knights may be recognized by the symbol of
Enaerai--the eye within a triangle.  

THE OFFICES OF KNIGHTHOOD

The organization of the Knighthood is straightforward, run with the
efficiency and manner one would expect of a military order.  Knights heed
the directions of their superiors without question, sacrificing life and
even soul to the cause.  

The Knight Lord leads the Knights.  He or she is the highest officer and
supreme commander of the Knights, maintaining the order of the knighthood
and directing them in actions to right the balance.  

There are up to three captains of the Knights, who vote for the new Lord
should the office be absent.  Each is also given the leadership of the Mett,
Idris, or Ilthar divisions of the Knights.  

The Captain of Mett is charged with subterfuge, spying, scouting, and
providing necessary reconnaissance, as well as leading the rogue component
and other miscellaneous forces of the Knight body.  

The Captain of Idris pools and compiles knowledge regarding adventurers in
the land and their effects on the balance, and the balance between houses,
as well as leading the magical or scholarly forces of the Knight body.  

The Captain of Ilthar is charged with being the second, under the Knight
Lord, to direct in battle, to administer punishment of final death to
renegade Knights who have broaken their oaths of Knighthood, and to lead the
warrior forces of the Knight body.

Knights of Mett maintain their secrecy, lest their future
usefulness to the cause of Balance be reduced.  If it is necessary
for those of Idris to battle, all efforts should be made to secure
documents away safely prior to the fight.  Otherwise, much work may
be lost, or perhaps even captured and capitalized upon.  Clearly,
this is not a desirable outcome.

It is an honor to be a Knight of Enaerai.  To be among those
chosen to uphold the Balance that is so essential to these lands.
May Enaerai bless us all, and may her Eye ever gaze upon us with

Alas, despite the clear need for Balance, so many refuse to
accept it.  In most cases, this is not an active opposition to the
idea, rather, most prevalent is an apathy or lack of exposure to
it.  Therefore, the Knights of Enaerai seek to correct this.  There
are many differing methods for this, among them, simple teaching
and spreading of the ideas, to convince others of the need.
Failing this, some may be convinced to act as needed for the
Balance by making it not worth their while to refuse.  And
sometimes, though this need not be a last resort, direct violence
is required.  However the case may be, the overarching goal and
function of every Knight is to work towards maintaining the
balance.

The role the Idris branch plays in this is threefold.  Firstly,
it is the responsibility and function of Idris to consider,
develop, and spread the concept of Balance in all of its
manifestations.  This is done, of course, according to the
teachings of the Great Lady Enaerai, whom every Knight pledges to
serve at their induction.  Secondly, Knights of Idris should keep
information on adventurers, insofar as it pertains to their outlook
on life.  Ideally, this information is largely supplied by the Mett
branch.  The purpose of this is to provide an outlet for correcting
the balance when the Scales of Orlin lean overmuch.  The more that
is known, the more readily action may be taken.

This section continues on the fifth and final page.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION There are those who, possessed of a more altruistic outlook,
cannot conceive of the need for Balance because it permits, even 
requires, darkness and evil.  This idea is intrinsically flawed.
Consider a world where there was no such thing as 'poor'.  Every
inhabitant of this world must have the same number and quality of
possession as every other.  If this were not true, there would be
some sort of difference of degree in wealth, and whichever had less
would be deemed 'poor', even if they were by our standards 
fabulously wealthy.  This is true because titles like 'rich' and 
'poor' are utterly relative to one another.  Yet, even if the case
where each denizen had the exact same as every other were true, 
none of them could be called 'rich'  Not poor, but not rich either.
In the same way, 'good' and 'evil' are relative descriptors.  If 
there was no darkness, no evil, in the lands, then there could be 
no good, nor any light.  And how can someone who claims to seek
good actively choose a world in which there was no good or light?
And so their argument fails.

With just what has so far been presented, one might perceive
Balance as a necessary burden to carry, a chore that must be
performed.  In truth, it is a glorious thing, a gift granted to us
all, not a punishment.  But, one might argue, Balance dictates that
if you experience joy and pleasure, you must also at some point
experience pain.  How can that be a gift?


He who seeks an understanding of such an apparent paradox should
refrain from taking food or drink of any kind for an extended
period of time, until his mouth is parched and his stomache has
long since ceased rumbling from hunger.  After the time has passed,
he should partake of a simple meal, perhaps some Nendorian cakes
and water.  Provided the length of his fast was ample, the joy he 
feels, and the pleasure of relief in such a meagre banquet, is far
greater than he would have felt with a sumptuous array had he not
abstained.  The point of this is to understand the function of pain
and sacrifice - these things enhance the experiences of joy and
pleasure.  They bring focus into our lives.  And then a
comprehension of the gift of Balance is easy to grasp.  Balance is
that which takes our joys and makes them truly joyful, and our
pains and makes them truly painful.  In truth, it is that which
expands the sensation of life itself, for no life is without any
joy or any pain.  And in that, Balance is a great gift to us all.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION {W***The Necessity of Balance***{x

Having defined what is actually meant by Balance, the natural
question that arises is "Why should this Balance be upheld?".  At 
the simplest level, the answer to this is that it is the natural 
way.  Evidence of this can be found all throughout nature - in the
daily interchange of sun and moons, in the lives and deaths of all
living creatures, in the cycle of seasons.  Even in the fascinating 
interplay of water and fire - the former will quench the latter,
but in the process neutralize itself into vapor - can this concept
of balance be found.  The original Three of the Pantheon, with or
without realizing it, created the world this way.

And example may be taken from those very Three.  One of the
light, one of the darkness, one of neither persuasion: in all, 
perfect balance.  At first glance, this may seem defeated by the
fact that each followed an orderly way.  But a slightly deeper 
understanding of the matter reveals that this is necessary, for 
balance to be acheived.  After all, before the form and order they
created, there was only chaos.  Their very lawfulness balanced this
disarray, and neatly completes the example.

Many reject the necessity of Balance, choosing instead to seek
personal gain. This reveals, however, the narrowness of their
scope.  For to defy the natural way is to place oneself at risk.
If excessive, nature itself will rebuke the imbalance.  This very
instance was exemplified in the raising up of the Goddess Girikha,
to offset the rigid control of the law.  Thus, ignoring or
attempting to overpower Balance for personal gain is an act doomed
to fail, unless somehow that force is stronger than nature itself
(and by extension, the might of all Three combined).

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION {W***The Essence of Balance***{x

The term 'Balance', particularly as it relates to the Knights of Enaerai,
has been at times misunderstood.  One of the most common misconceptions of
this ideal semms to be the thought that there can nothing extreme in one's
life.  That somehow, all colors must be grey, all actions minimal and
mundane, all food bland, all excitement contained.  But such a lifestyle
would be unnecessarily unfulfilling.  No, the key to understanding what is
truly meant by Balance is to realize that for any phenomena, there is, or
should be, a counter-phenomena.  That is, if one side of the spectrum of
etremities is experienced, so should the other, in its turn.  Practically
speaking, this translates into the coexistance of, for example, good and
evil.  Or perhaps order and disorder.  

To understand this further, consider the analogue of a board of wood evenly
levelled atop a small rock.  When there is naught upon the board, it is
balanced.  However, it serves no purpose.  This is analogous to the world
ere it was populated with life - balanced, yet unfulfilled.  If an object of
uniform shape and weight is placed in the exact center of the board, the
setup will remain balanced.  For the sake of the analogy, assume that no
further objects can be placed atop this one, that is, that none of these are
stackable.  In that case, the board is level (and therefore acceptable), but
the system still has not achieved its full potential, as there remains a
great length of unladen board.  This is similar to the lifestyle described
in the beginning, that of blandness and relative inaction.  Indeed, it can
even be easily argued that such a way of life is inherently unbalanced in
and of itself, but that is not the point of this present explanation.  The
board has not reached its full potential until its entire length is covered,
in the middle and at both extremes.  And behold, that though there exist
objects at the extremities of the board - analogously, at the extremities of
life - the board remains level and balanced.  That is what is meant by
'Balance': not the absence of extremes, but rather their equilibrium.
