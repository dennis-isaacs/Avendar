#DESCRIPTION Upon the sheet is a physical description of a massive stone beast,
accompanied by a crude drawing as well as several measurements.
Your eye is caught by a short passage saying:
 
-Eyes: Sparked by some sort of unholy flame, they appear capable of
seeing through any physical and/or mental subterfuges.  Even using
the assassin's art of cloaking, I was not able to make my way past
the being.
 
-Claws: Forged from an unknown organic material, they seem to be
affected by an unknown enchantment.  Sharper than the keenest
razor, they seem able to cut through any material.
 
-Flesh: Carved of some sort of immutable stone, the beast appears
to be completely impervious to all sorts of physical attack.
Although it is true that my magical repertoire is somewhat limited,
I would be forced to say that spells are also useless against this
monstrousity.  Perhaps a scholar that is not limited to scrollwork
can tell me otherwise.
-------
On the back of the sheet, you can see additional notes, obviously
written by a different hand.  Most of it regards the possible types
of enchantments used in the creation of the beast, as well as
arcane lore surrounding golem creation.  One particular paragraph
reads:
 
  Dilalyn, although certainly not the first maker of sentient
sculptures, definitely the one of most reknown.  Little of him
is known, with most of our information stemming from legend and
the occasional architectural find.  The majority of his pieces
have been found by the few brave scholars willing to travel to
the depths of Yithoul.
  Other possible sources of information: Qilaunin, Thethtil's
tomb.

Herbalists oft recommend the fruit to improve night vision and for general
digestive well-bring.  Tea brewed of peach bark or leaves is thought to

#NAME An Empty Courtyard
#DESCRIPTION The barricade ends abruptly, opening up into a large open area.  A few
wooden benches are available for tired soldiers to sit on, but a fine layer
of dust reveals just how frequently they are used.  A large marble fountain
sits in the center of the courtyard, a pool of dirty water sitting stagnant
at its base.  To the west, you can see the School of the Shining Blade,
where the famed aelin swordmaster, Colonel Eanaar, is reported to teach.  To
the east, the renowned ch'taren scholar, Valaiar Nora holds his classes in
the School of Spirit.

ornamental skins, each one hung over a miniature iron plaque, dedicated to
the brave hunter that caught the beast.  Several racks of well kept items
line the floor, each one packed with various and sundry goods.  Towards the

#NAME The Beginning of Civilian Road
#DESCRIPTION You stand at the end of Civilian Road.  One of the few such roads in Kor
Thrandir, it was built as a gift to the civilians that moved in to Kor
Thrandir, rewarding them for putting their lives on the line for the service
of the military.  A few citizens walk casually across the street, knowing
that they are safe from the shuddeni threat.  To the north is a warehouse of
sorts, while the Scholar's Pen lies to the south.

#NAME The Scholar's Pen
#DESCRIPTION As you enter the Scholar's pen, the most immediate sensation is that of a
small burbling noise, emanating from the back.  The scent of something
slightly burnt drifts through the air.  A large shelved table dominates the
center of the room, covered with an eccentric collection of potions, staves,
and wands, all in various states of disarray.  Mystical baubles and musty
books lie commingling upon the table's surface.  A smaller table,
overflowing with numerous scrolls and unfinished parchments, occupies a
corner on the south end of the store.  A diffuse red glow, emanating from a
glistening sphere upon the ceiling, lights the room.

smoke streaming from the various scented candles placed about the shop. 
Laid out in a sparse manner, the main shopping area offers little more than
a few racks of traditional herbal medicines, packed away in jars of hand
blown glass.  The main portion of the store lies behind the oaken counter,
where rows upon rows of labeled jars can be seen, containing remedies for
dozens of the more potent diseases.  A plain wooden door leads outside to
the Civilian Road.

#DESCRIPTION As you inspect the Logorin Star, your sense of reality blurs and the hall
warps around you..  

When your sight returns you stand at the lip of a great pit hewn into foul
black earth.  Beyond it the walls and spires of some infernal city rise into
the unwholesome skies.  Your gaze is drawn downwards into the depths of the
chasm.  Within, hundreds upon thousands of chittering and clattering horrors
writhe in a sea of chitin and spines.  Horrible insectoid abberations and
spined crocodiles climb over one another as screaming figures are tossed
into the pit, fighting to messily devour the offerings.  

As you gaze at this scene of horror you feel a sudden pressure as you are
pitched over the cliff yourself.  Falling helplessly you can only scream as
you watch the glistening spines and rending mandibles draw closer, waiting
to envelop you in a sea of pain.  

You suddenly jerk back to your senses, the Logorin Star searing itself into
your mind.

#NAME A Plush Ambassador's Suite
#DESCRIPTION You stand in a room lavishly decorated, flower murals covering the walls,
only to be covered by rare exotic paintings.  Works of Aelin art, such as
the iridiscent chalia glass, are neatly organized on lighted pedestals. 
Strips of delicately scented silk dangle from the walls, their intoxicating
scent filling the room.  A well-polished rosewood desk is in the corner, a
plush chair beside it.  A down-filled bed, covered by a luxurious green
canopy, occupies the corner of the room.  An elaborately carved door opens
to the south.

#DESCRIPTION A large spacious suite greets your sight, with green flowery murals
decorating the walls.  Overburdened bookshelves are stacked against the
walls, nearly collapsing under the weight of all the books.  Miscellaneous
scrolls litter the ground, their scholarly theories completely disregarded. 
A desk is hidden in the corner, stacks of paper hiding it from view.  In the
corner is a large bed, the only piece of furniture in the room untouched by
paper.  Neatly made, it looks as if it has never even been used.
