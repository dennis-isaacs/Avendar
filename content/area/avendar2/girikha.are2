impish head and snout, he looks far more bat-like then most nefortu's.  His
eyes are wide and ever attentive staring at the world above him.  His sharp
face is covered with black symbols of words in kankoran tattooed into the
skin.  Above his head rest his large alert ears, ever moving and twitching
to hear the sounds in the glade around him.  He keeps his tiny wings tucked
behind him so they don't drag on the ground, spreading them to their full
length when he takes to the winds.

#DESCRIPTION Your eyes fall upon the form of an old woman.  Whitened hair falls to the
small of her back, a few light blonde streaks the only thing left that hint
at its old color.  The long hair is held away from her face in a ponytail. 
Her skin is leathery and dark, the apparent effects of long years of
exposure to the sun.  The skin on her face is also greatly wrinkled,
probably brought on by a mixture of simple aging and, again, exposure to the
elements.  Light-green eyes outlined by long lashes may be the only feature
in her face that could be called beautiful.  Her thin lips are cracked and
brittle.  A long neck leads down to the rest of her slender body four long
limbs spreading out from her medium-sized torso.  Despite her aged
appearance, she holds herself upright.  Her posture seems near-immaculate. 
Finally, you notice branded upon her arm the glowing form of a running,
full-grown wolf.

jagged mountain stone rises to the east and south, blocking passage. 
Through it, a swirling tempest can be seen below this location, wrapping
itself around the mountain sinuously.  The trees become thicker to the west
as the glade continues, and a well-watered patch of wild herbs grows to the

shines brightly.  Through it, you can see the motions of the pack of
kankoran on the Ryarl plains.  The western edge sports a portal whose edge
is covered in thick leaves, vines, and branches.  Through it, you can see
the wilderness of Nendor forest.  Directly east of here, the ledge widens
into a wild herb garden, and westward the narrow ledge sticks out into the

covered with grass, weeds, and other plants that have been let to grow
freely.  The mountain itself supports the glade to the west and south with a
curved, jagged rockface.  Beyond some of the lower points of the retaining
wall, glimpses of a twirling tempest can be seen.  The mountain towers
overhead, yet a staircase that appears to have been naturally formed leads
up here toward its apex.  The glade continues to the east, and a hunter's
outpost has been built into and around the stone to the north.

#NAME A Mountain Peak
#DESCRIPTION This mountain peak appears to be the top of the world.  The world
stretches out beyond in every direction.  To the north and east, the Jyark
mountains continue.  A peek of the magestic titan palace can be seen to the
north-northeast.  Westward, the plains of Ryarl sprawl into the distance. 
Far beyond, on the horizon, the walls of Krilin fortress are barely visible.
To the south, the mountains die off into Shendaer.  Its walls appear to be
subsumed by the north forest, making the cursed city appear nearly
inconsequential.  

At the very peak of the mountain, a statue of a howling wolf has been
formed, appearing to have been made out of the very stone of the mountain
itself.  Its muzzle is tipped into a howl, calling triumphantly to the
skies.  An inscription has been made in the rock around the foot of the
statue in both kankoran and common, which reads "For the freedom of all, and
the purity of the land."
