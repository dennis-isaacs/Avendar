by the curse that fell on all the lands, it long ago forgot its work.  It
looks to have once been human, though it is not easy to discern much else
through its rotting appearance.  Though its undead appetite can never be
appeased, it nonetheless endlessly seeks for life to feed upon.

taken its toll on his muscles, and what little flesh remains to cover his
skeletal frame is constantly rotting.  The sockets that used to contain his
eyes are now empty holes, yet somehow he seems to see.  The foreman no
longer directs the other miners, choosing instead to join them in their

it fails to righten itself completely.  Despite its slack jaw and dull black
eyes, the creature appears to be tensed.  Devoid of apparent hair and
reeking with a most foul aroma, the yreg seems to be rotting slowly.  Long
claws adorn both of its hands, but on only one of them are they cracked and
yellow.  Faint burbling sounds emanate occasionally from the yreg's hideous
maw.

#LORE This compass was fashioned by the legendary Ghertin of Avirle, whose
skills as both a craftman and a warrior were widely-known in the early days
of the Republic.  His fascination with valuable stones led Ghertin to craft
several enchanted compasses.  Though many have been lost to the feckless
winds of time, a few are still used today.  It is believed that Baron Krilin
and the Patrician each have one.  

To form this particular model, Ghertin had to fight and slay the Wyrm of
Orlot, a foul beast which plagued the Uthlin in his time.  From its scales
he made this device, and imbued in it the power to locate precious gems. 
How the compass came into the hands of King Gogoth is not precisely known,
but ere the curse upon the realm of Gogoth the king's miners used it in
their efforts.

rigorously searches for souls that have been twisted in such a way as to be
denied Salvation or Damnation.  Upon discovering these souls adequately
detached from their hold on the Prime Materium, the power of the orb bends
the spirit in such a way as to permit it passage.

#LORE The Dove of Arafia was worn by the renowned healer-mage when he ventured
into the Nether Pits to save his lover, Istera the Green.  Unfortunately,
mortal knowledge of the Dove prior to that time is essentially nonexistent,
though some is known of its later role in the affairs of the world.  For
many generations the Dove was passed down the line of Arafia.  Each new
generation of his line was more degenerate than the last, at least in
regards to abilities and fame.  Arafia's good-heartedness, though mitigated,
was still present in the last of his line to bear the Dove.  

This last was a simple mine worker in the realm of Gogoth king, at the time
of the hideous curse which granted eternal undeath to the kingdom.  Few
indeed escaped the effects of the curse, but Perrun of the line of Arafia
was one of them, for the Dove about his neck protected him.  In tragic
irony, his now-undead fellow miners mauled him to death within moments.  

When the demon demilord Naluzdandur began to take form within the mines, he
recognized the proximity of the holy power of the Dove as an impediment to
his designs.  Though much of its former strength had been expended to
counter Gogoth's powerful curse, the Dove yet remained a potent artifact. 
To deal with this, Naluzdandur succeeded in hiding it away within a pocket
of the Void, near the Veil.  

The sojourn of the Archmage Leycera was ostensibly undertaken in search for
the Dove, but once her party left Var Bandor all official accounts of its
fate cease.

point.  Formed from glittering platinum into the shape of a dove, it fits
around the neck by means of a delicate chain of the same material.  The
gently-curved wings of the dove spread outward from its body, and the small
graceful beak points downward.

#DESCRIPTION I don't know how much longer I have, doubtless only a few hours, so I am
scribbling these pages in the hopes that one day my account might be found. 
Already the shadows draw close about me, and darkness seeks to overwhelm my
fading spirit...  

It all started with Leycera, as most things did.  I first met her when I was
a mere pupil in the Tower of Salyra, when we received among our patients one
afflicted by a blight of the mind that mystified even the more advanced
journeymagi of the guild.  One of the masters recognized it as Void work,
and sent for a magus from the Order of the Silver Light.  

I was tending a nearby patient when Leycera arrived.  Though she was less
than half of my eighteen years, already she was a respected journeywoman of
Spirit magics.  I had heard of her briefly as a rising genius of the Order,
but this was the first I had ever seen her.  Like most of her peculiar race,
her skin was a warm golden color, faintly translucent.  Her hair was long
and silvered, but not the silver of old age that I will not live to see. 
She entered with a grace and power that was evident even to one of my lowly
station, but no trace of haughtiness clouded her presence.  The power she
bore simply was, and she took it for granted as one of the rest of us might
regard an arm or leg.  

It did not take her long to finish with the afflicted man, but ere she
departed I noticed that she cast a meaningful glance at me, as if somehow
knowing even then that our fates were to be so greatly intertwined.

#DESCRIPTION When next I saw Leycera, I had grown myself into a respected journeywoman
in the Tower.  She had not in the meantime left the promise of her rapid
ascent unfulfilled, and there was much rumor that she would soon be named an
Archmage.  At the time, I had just finished delivering my thesis on the
Cousten meditation techniques, and was surprised to find her waiting for me
afterwards.  Surprised by her, yes, but even more so by the startling green
eyes of the human behind her.  His face was kindly and bestubbled with a
faint beard.  He comported himself with an unusual grace, and he seemed to
radiate charm.  Prentirn, I recalled, the famed swordmaster.  A quick glance
to the two elegant blades at his sides confirmed the recollection.  But why
was he here?  

Leycera was complimenting me on the thesis.  Bringing my thoughts back to
the present, I flushed slightly in embarrassment.  We conversed for a brief
period, but she never introduced Prentirn or explained her visit.  When I
retired to my chambers that evening, however, it was not her face that
stayed in my mind as I drifted off, but his.

#KEYWORDS  three pagethree
#DESCRIPTION Three months later Prentirn's presence was suddenly explained.  The news
of the wedding of the famed swordmaster to the archmage spread quickly, and
much talk of it abounded in the Tower, as well.  Much to my surprise, I was
invited.  The ceremony itself was a formal occasion, but has little bearing
on this recanting.  I must move on, as the protective glow continues to
fade.  

It was a full two years before I saw Leycera again.  I was in my study,
pouring over a text by Tresacran on the theory of elementals when she
appeared suddenly in my doorway.  She cut her usual graceful figure, clad in
shimmering silver robes and radiating excitement.  "I think I've found it!" 
She said.  The uncustomary entrance and greeting caught me off-guard, but I
quickly regained my composure and offered her a seat.  Declining, she paced
about the room, speaking rapidly.  

"I have for some years now been studying ancient artifacts, attempting to
discern their powers, purposes, and whereabouts.  The past year I have
dedicated to finding the Dove of Arafia, an amulet of considerable power. 
And I think I have it!"  

Leycera continued her rant for some time, and slowly her enthusiam spread to
me.  Apparently, her research had uncovered that the Dove had passed down
the line of Arafia, a line that dwindled in renown as the ages passed. 
Though the story of Arafia's descent into the Nether Pits for his lover is
well-known, there are few tales indeed of any heroic deeds performed by his
descendants.  At length the Dove came into the possession of the last of his
line, a simple mine worker living in the realm of Gogoth.  When the foul
King's curse fell upon the kingdom, all knowledge of the Dove passed from
mortal memory.  But not if Leycera was to have her way.  She was proposing a
journey to the undead city itself, in search of the Dove.  And she wanted me
along.

#DESCRIPTION If there is one thing to be said of Leycera, it is that she always
managed to get her way.  We set out within the week.  The plan was to make
the trip to Var Bandor first, to prepare our supplies and rendevous with the
rest of our party.  Apparently, this meant a small band of mercenaries from
Ashta Harrud that Leycera had secured some time before in anticipation of
the journey.  From Bandor we would press on to the Undead City itself.  

The trip along the Arien Road was largely uneventful, the way I liked it. 
Besides Leycera, Prentirn, and myself, there was only one attendant with us,
a hulking kankoran with a gruff appearance and surprisingly pleasant
demeanor.  We made quite a spectacle.  Two humans, a ch'taren, and a
kankoran moving purposefully west together cannot fail to raise eyebrows,
especially when one is a famous warrior and the other an almost
equally-renowned archmage.  

Leycera and Prentirn spent much time together, and I could not help but feel
a twinge of jealousy for her.  Men of his kind did not come by often.  I
thought then -- and know now -- that I spent too much time on my studies. 
But alas, naught can be done at this point.

#DESCRIPTION We reached the port town of Var Bandor the evening of the 13th day of The
Reaping.  After being ferried across the Dantaron, we secured lodging at The
Journey's End, not too far from Bandor's main square.  Every time I came
here I liked it less and less, and this instance was no exception. 
Earendam, the city of my birth and youth, is far grander.  

The next day we went to the Nymph's Tears to meet with the captain of the
mercenaries.  A tall human clad in the armor of the Tarnan mercenary house
and bearing a prepossessing grin, I liked him at once.  Later I learned he
had been a friend of Leycera's father, and was not unknown to Prentirn,
either.  The man's name was Damasd, and he was accompanied by a lieutenant
of sorts by the name of Fersn.  This latter I did not like from the moment I
laid eyes on him, and later events bore this intuition out.  His skin was a
noticeable shade lighter than the copper color of the captain, bordering on
sallow.  Several scars (from knife-fighting, I later learned) were evident
on his knuckles, and his smile seemed forced.  The rest of the men were of a
mixed sort and numbered six, not including Damasd or Fersn.  

Leycera provided funds (where did she get all the money?)  for canoes, and
ere long our reinforced party was on its way down the Dantaron towards the
cursed plains of Shargob.  What fools we mortals be.

#KEYWORDS  six pagesix
#DESCRIPTION We traveled the Dantaron, arriving at a possible mooring point sometime
in the late afternoon.  The place looked to have been a dock at one point,
but was quite overrun now.  A sign was posted -- "Warning!  To the west are
the cursed Plains of Shargob!  To enter is death!".  We tied up our boats
and proceeded to enter into our first squabble.  The Tarnan mercenaries
wanted to spend the night at the makeshift dock rather than risk the plains
by the night that was fast approaching.  Looking out over what I could see
of the barren lands to the west, I could see their point.  Leycera, however,
had different ideas.  And Leycera always got her way.  After a small
argument, we began trudging west, the mercenaries muttering amongst
themselves.  Soon we had left the boats behind, along with the unheeded
warning sign, which kept its grim watch over the docks.  

After we had proceeded some leagues along an ancient road, the sun fell
behind the tall westerly mountains called the Yagash.  I could feel my heart
rate increase almost involuntarily.  It was almost an hour before I realized
my knuckles had grown white from gripping my staff.  Leycera, apparently
unfazed by the evil of the place, led the way.  She was infused with a soft
white light, and I could once again appreciate the extraordinary charisma
she possessed.  Somehow, I was comforted.  

We arrived at a bend in the road without incident, despite the decidedly
unwholesome skitterings we heard from all around us.  There we made camp,
appointing several of the men to keep watch.  I think Leycera may have, as
well, but I was too exhausted to do much but sleep, and they didn't disturb
me until we were preparing to move on.  As I roused my sore muscles the
thought of soft couches and comfortable beds flashed across my mind, but I
quickly suppressed it.  Too much to do.  

Sometime after noon, we reached the ruins of Gogoth city.

#DESCRIPTION How can I describe what we found in that horrible city?  And yet, our
experiences paled in comparison to what happened later.  Undead zombies
stalked through the place, ever a threat even though our trained mercenaries
made short work of each that wandered too close.  The stench was
overbearing, and it required a stiff force of will on at least my part to
continue.  I think it helped to reflect on what it would mean to turn back
alone now.  

At one point we came across the form of a child, shuffling along in its
undeath.  What foulness possessed the king to so doom his kingdom? 
Fortunately, we didn't have to slay it, as the creature moved along away
from us.  We searched a great portion of the city, relying on Leycera's
sense of spirit to guide us to repositories of power.  In this manner we
found a run-down temple and several items of minor (and typically unholy)
strength.  The Dove, however, was not to be found.  As the day wore on, I
looked with increasing apprehension at the palace that loomed to the north. 
Surely, I felt, that was our next destination.  The mere rumor of what lay
within was enough to chill me to the bone, and I entertained little desire
to verify those tales.  

As the day wore to a close, Leycera made the announcement.  Much to my
surprise, we were not to enter the palace, but rather seek out the mines.  I
supposed that it made sense, as the descendant of Arafia was one of the
miners in this place.  It would be several more days ere I realized that she
had to have known that would be our destination from the start.  Nothing
else makes sense - why else the excess of hired force?  Why else choose to
not search the palace, and why else give up so easily on the city?  Why else
prepare the orb?...  But I am getting ahead of myself.  At the time, I was
simply flooded with relief at not having to enter the palace.  Now, I wish
we had chosen the palace.  No.  I wish we had never come.

#DESCRIPTION The mercenaries grumbled again when we stepped off the road onto the
cursed plains, but didn't put up much of a verbal fight.  Perhaps they were
inspired by the ease of passage thus far, or perhaps they were just glad to
be putting the awful reek of the city behind them.  We had camped on the
road for the night, again without incident, and so were opposed only by a
few large crabs as we traversed the plains to the mines.  Leycera led us
swiftly and surely, and we never had to face that rumored horror, the
maglat.  Perhaps it doesn't exist, I know not.  

It was late morning when we reached the mines.  The entrance loomed in front
of us, dark and forbidding, and for a moment I wondered about the wisdom of
this move.  But Prentirn entered without hesitation, a fine display of
courage.  And so, trusting to Leycera's judgment, I pushed the doubts aside
and followed.  If you have found this manuscript, you already know of what
these mines contain, so I will not provide excessive detail.  Time is
becoming more important now, and I fear I must hasten my narrative.

#DESCRIPTION We soon came across these strange beasts, "yregi", as Leycera named them.
Denizens of the mines, partially turned undead by the curse of Gogoth.  With
twisted souls, they could not perish.  Somehow, Leycera had foreseen this
difficulty.  She produced an orb fashioned of glass from her robes,
apparently imbued with some sort of spirit magic that allowed yreg souls to
pass on.  I do not understand it, and it no longer matters to me.  My gruff
kankoran friend bore its weight as we traveled.  

It was here that we suffered our first casualty.  The yregi came in a swarm,
and though we drove them back, one of the mercenaries was slain.  This,
naturally, caused further unrest amongst those who remained.  Fortunately,
Damasd stepped in with a firm hand and got them back in order.  We pressed
forward swiftly.  

Ere long we came to a strange device.  It looked like a cage of sorts, and
was attached to the ceiling by a system of pulleys.  It did not take long to
determine that the device could be lowered slowly down a large hole in the
ground, presumably a former vertical shaft.  Though the tunnel we were in
continued off to the north, Leycera seemed unhesitating in her desire to go
deeper into the mines.  Even Damasd looked at her with momentary disbelief,
but we all dutifully followed.

#DESCRIPTION We took shifts lowering people.  It was possible to lower oneself, but
required more muscular effort.  Hence, the kankoran -- whose name I could
never pronounce, much less scribe -- was the last to go.  He was lowering
the last of the mercenaries down to the rest of us standing below when we
heard a terrific bellowing sound from above.  

The horror of what was happening struck us at about the same time as the
cage struck the ground.  Hard.  The Tarnan warrior didn't stand a chance. 
Apparently, the mine shaft didn't either.  The impact of the device was
enough to shake the shaft, and bits of rock began falling from above.  It
soon turned into a shower of stone, accompanied by the roars of our kankoran
compatriot, who was fighting for his life at the top of the steep shaft.  

Then the ceiling collapsed.  We fled into the mining tunnel to escape being
crushed.  It suddenly occurred to me that despite the distate I had borne
for Var Bandor, I would have given anything to have been back there.  I do
not know what happened to the trusty kankoran, nor the orb he carried.  Both
were missed sorely over the next two days, measuring by the sleeping periods
we attempted to observe.  

We made camp in a dark bend in the tunnel, leaving fully half of our
remaining complement to stand guard.  It was the first I had seen Leycera
actually look worried.

#DESCRIPTION Somehow, we all survived the night.  One of the mercenaries complained of
horrific nightmares, but none of us found that particularly surprising. 
Remarkably, there were few jibes made in regards to this from amongst the
hired warriors.  We had nothing to do but press on, so we did, wearing our
hearts in our throats.  

How can I describe the events of that day, to do justice to what we all
felt?  The terror I experienced was surpassed only by that which I felt the
next day, and now.  I have not the time to detail this more dramatically, so
I will be blunt.  We were assailed by massive beasts with horrific, bulbous
eyes and deadly jaws.  They slew two more of the mercenaries, but this was
not foremost in my mind.  One of the many-legged creatures struck towards
Leycera, but Prentirn intervened.  Even with his remarkable speed and
agility, he had only the time to place his own body in front of hers, not to
turn the blow itself.  And so, deep within the cursed earth, Prentirn of the
Blazing Swords met his end in the jaws of an overgrown insect.  

I cannot imagine what Leycera must have felt.  The look that transfixed her
face defies recounting.  However, I know myself the loss I felt.  I think in
that moment I realized what it truly means to be mortal, and to know that
death will come soon.  It would likely have come then, were it not for
Damasd.  Somehow, he managed to organize a retreat deeper into the mines,
down a sloping shaft.  The creatures did not follow, and we had a chance to
take stock of our situation.  

Needless to say, it was bleak.

#DESCRIPTION Of the twelve who originally set out, only half now remained: Leycera,
myself, Damasd, Fersn, and two of the hired warriors.  There was no
grumbling anymore.  One of the mercenaries -- the same who had complained of
nightmares -- was particularly jittering, constantly looking over his
shoulder and peering into the shadows.  Maybe he had cause to.  He was next
to go.  

It happened suddenly.  A dark mist roiled up from out of time and space,
covering the mercenary completely.  Just as swiftly as it came, it departed
again...  And the man of Tarnan was no longer there.  There were no cries or
shouts.  He simply wasn't there anymore.  We continued on in stony silence,
our spirits gripped by a firm resolve to see this through.  After all, we
could no longer turn back.  

As the five of us passed through the depths of the mines, we glimpsed some
strange creatures that looked almost like fearsome walking tripods. 
Fortunately, they passed swiftly by.  We continued our descent into further
darkness.

#DESCRIPTION We had travelled for some time when Leycera stopped suddenly and ordered
us to make camp.  Relieved to have the rest, we gladly obliged.  The shining
light around the archmage had faded to a muted glow by this time.  I
marvelled at her ability to remain composed after all that had happened. 
But even as I admired her, half-formulated suspicions grew in my mind.  Why
were we going so deeply into the mines?  Why had she hired a much bigger
force than was necessary to enter the city?  She must have known we would be
coming here...  And I was less than certain we were actually here for the
Dove.  But what she had in mind, I knew not.  

We had not yet finished our meager meal when It came.  A Shadow, the like of
which I had never before seen, swept about us, and for a moment all was
dark.  I cried out in terror as it passed, and my heart felt ready to
explode from overwork.  Fersn and the mercenary froze in place, tied down by
their fear.  Damasd, like the true soldier he was, had somehow already
grabbed his spear and stood at the ready by the time I noticed him.  Leycera
snapped to attention, but did not seem surprised.  She must have been
expecting this.  

We had arrived.  The end was nigh.

#DESCRIPTION The ensuing struggle cannot be adequately described in the common tongue,
or any that I know.  What the Shadow was I still know not, but it fought
with an unnatural strength.  The hired Tarnan fell to it swiftly, his body
vanishing beyond sight and mind.  Fersn cowered behind Damasd, who took the
brunt of the onslaught.  All around us the darkness grew, and demons of
night and dusk seemed to spring from the walls themselves.  I was far too
focused on keeping Damasd alive to notice precisely what Leycera was doing,
so it came as a surprise when the bright light sprang out from her to fill
the cavern.  The demons snarled, drawing back from the intensity of the
illumination.  In front of me, Damasd slumped to the ground.  He was dead. 


As quickly as they had come, the denizens of the deep vanished.  There was a
moment of stillness.  Then a mocking laugh echoed down the passage towards
us, and a dark form began to materialize before us.  

Leycera wasted no time.  She shoved a strangely-humming ruby into my hands,
then hauled Fersn up from his cowering position and placed an equally
singular sapphire in his shaking palms.  I could feel the power of the stone
throbbing in my grasp, and suddenly a calm swept over me.  What would be,
would be.

#DESCRIPTION As the dark form started to take definite shape, Leycera raised her hands
high.  One of them clutched a diamond of unusual clarity, and the other was
faced palm outwards towards the black outline.  Though I am fairly adept at
the ch'taren language, the words she spoke were uttered too quickly for me
to understand.  I could feel the power focused from my ruby as she spoke
them, spreading out towards the darkness...  

And nothing happened.  The incantation failed.  For the first time, I had
seen the power of Leycera fail entirely.  The calm resolve that had washed
over me quickly faded into anxiety and fear, and I glanced around in
panicked confusion.  It was that glance that explained the matter to me. 
Leycera was there, still shining brightly as the darkness formed.  But
across from me, the only trace I could make of Fersn was his legs, moving
swiftly away from us.  

It is said that the courage of one can raise a nation, and the cowardice of
one can break it.  Never before had I realized the truth of that adage.  The
fool.  He had nowhere to run but to death.  But such is the nature of times

pull out the true character that lies underneath.

into the dark shape grew in intensity.  I did not at first realize where the
power was being drawn from, I was just grateful to see it appear.  Slowly, a

#DESCRIPTION Leycera understood the problem as quickly as I did.  Her chant did not
stop, but instead subtly altered.  Suddenly, the beam of light streaming
into the dark shape grew in intensity.  I did not at first realize where the
power was being drawn from, I was just grateful to see it appear.  Slowly, a
wall of pure light formed between us and the shape, which hollered and
bellowed in frustration.  Soon, it was completely sealed off.  Then Leycera

#DESCRIPTION As the dark form started to take definite shape, Leycera raised her hands
high.  One of them clutched a diamond of unusual clarity, and the other was
faced palm outwards towards the black outline.  Though I am fairly adept at
the ch'taren language, the words she spoke were uttered too quickly for me
to understand.  I could feel the power focused from my ruby as she spoke
them, spreading out towards the darkness...

And nothing happened.  The incantation failed.  For the first time, I had
seen the power of Leycera fail entirely.  The calm resolve that had washed
over me quickly faded into anxiety and fear, and I glanced around in
panicked confusion.  It was that glance that explained the matter to me. 
Leycera was there, still shining brightly as the darkness formed.  But
across from me, the only trace I could make of Fersn was his legs, moving
swiftly away from us.

It is said that the courage of one can raise a nation, and the cowardice of
one can break it.  Never before had I realized the truth of that adage.  The
fool.  He had nowhere to run but to death.  But such is the nature of times
like these -- they reach through the facade that all mortals invent, and
pull out the true character that lies underneath.

#DESCRIPTION The ensuing struggle cannot be adequately described in the common tongue,
or any that I know.  What the Shadow was I still know not, but it fought
with an unnatural strength.  The hired Tarnan fell to it swiftly, his body
vanishing beyond sight and mind.  Fersn cowered behind Damasd, who took the
brunt of the onslaught.  All around us the darkness grew, and demons of
night and dusk seemed to spring from the walls themselves.  I was far too
focused on keeping Damasd alive to notice precisely what Leycera was doing,
so it came as a surprise when the bright light sprang out from her to fill
the cavern.  The demons snarled, drawing back from the intensity of the
illumination.  In front of me, Damasd slumped to the ground.  He was dead.

As quickly as they had come, the denizens of the deep vanished.  There was a
moment of stillness.  Then a mocking laugh echoed down the passage towards
us, and a dark form began to materialize before us.

Leycera wasted no time.  She shoved a strangely-humming ruby into my hands,
then hauled Fersn up from his cowering position and placed an equally
singular sapphire in his shaking palms.  I could feel the power of the stone
throbbing in my grasp, and suddenly a calm swept over me.  What would be,
would be.

#DESCRIPTION We had travelled for some time when Leycera stopped suddenly and ordered
us to make camp.  Relieved to have the rest, we gladly obliged.  The shining
light around the archmage had faded to a muted glow by this time.  I
marvelled at her ability to remain composed after all that had happened. 
But even as I admired her, half-formulated suspicions grew in my mind.  Why
were we going so deeply into the mines?  Why had she hired a much bigger
force than was necessary to enter the city?  She must have known we would be
coming here...  And I was less than certain we were actually here for the
Dove.  But what she had in mind, I knew not.

We had not yet finished our meager meal when It came.  A Shadow, the like of
which I had never before seen, swept about us, and for a moment all was
dark.  I cried out in terror as it passed, and my heart felt ready to
explode from overwork.  Fersn and the mercenary froze in place, tied down by
their fear.  Damasd, like the true soldier he was, had somehow already
grabbed his spear and stood at the ready by the time I noticed him.  Leycera
snapped to attention, but did not seem surprised.  She must have been
expecting this.

We had arrived.  The end was nigh.

#DESCRIPTION Of the twelve who originally set out, only half now remained: Leycera,
myself, Damasd, Fersn, and two of the hired warriors.  There was no
grumbling anymore.  One of the mercenaries -- the same who had complained of
nightmares -- was particularly jittering, constantly looking over his
shoulder and peering into the shadows.  Maybe he had cause to.  He was next
to go.

It happened suddenly.  A dark mist roiled up from out of time and space,
covering the mercenary completely.  Just as swiftly as it came, it departed
again...  And the man of Tarnan was no longer there.  There were no cries or
shouts.  He simply wasn't there anymore.  We continued on in stony silence,
our spirits gripped by a firm resolve to see this through.  After all, we
could no longer turn back.

As the five of us passed through the depths of the mines, we glimpsed some
strange creatures that looked almost like fearsome walking tripods. 
Fortunately, they passed swiftly by.  We continued our descent into further
darkness.

#DESCRIPTION Somehow, we all survived the night.  One of the mercenaries complained of
horrific nightmares, but none of us found that particularly surprising. 
Remarkably, there were few jibes made in regards to this from amongst the
hired warriors.  We had nothing to do but press on, so we did, wearing our
hearts in our throats.

How can I describe the events of that day, to do justice to what we all
felt?  The terror I experienced was surpassed only by that which I felt the
next day, and now.  I have not the time to detail this more dramatically, so
I will be blunt.  We were assailed by massive beasts with horrific, bulbous
eyes and deadly jaws.  They slew two more of the mercenaries, but this was
not foremost in my mind.  One of the many-legged creatures struck towards
Leycera, but Prentirn intervened.  Even with his remarkable speed and
agility, he had only the time to place his own body in front of hers, not to
turn the blow itself.  And so, deep within the cursed earth, Prentirn of the
Blazing Swords met his end in the jaws of an overgrown insect.

I cannot imagine what Leycera must have felt.  The look that transfixed her
face defies recounting.  However, I know myself the loss I felt.  I think in
that moment I realized what it truly means to be mortal, and to know that
death will come soon.  It would likely have come then, were it not for
Damasd.  Somehow, he managed to organize a retreat deeper into the mines,
down a sloping shaft.  The creatures did not follow, and we had a chance to
take stock of our situation.

Needless to say, it was bleak.

#DESCRIPTION We soon came across these strange beasts, "yregi", as Leycera named them.
Denizens of the mines, partially turned undead by the curse of Gogoth.  With
twisted souls, they could not perish.  Somehow, Leycera had foreseen this
difficulty.  She produced an orb fashioned of glass from her robes,
apparently imbued with some sort of spirit magic that allowed yreg souls to
pass on.  I do not understand it, and it no longer matters to me.  My gruff
kankoran friend bore its weight as we traveled.

It was here that we suffered our first casualty.  The yregi came in a swarm,
and though we drove them back, one of the mercenaries was slain.  This,
naturally, caused further unrest amongst those who remained.  Fortunately,
Damasd stepped in with a firm hand and got them back in order.  We pressed
forward swiftly.

Ere long we came to a strange device.  It looked like a cage of sorts, and
was attached to the ceiling by a system of pulleys.  It did not take long to
determine that the device could be lowered slowly down a large hole in the
ground, presumably a former vertical shaft.  Though the tunnel we were in
continued off to the north, Leycera seemed unhesitating in her desire to go
deeper into the mines.  Even Damasd looked at her with momentary disbelief,
but we all dutifully followed.

#DESCRIPTION The mercenaries grumbled again when we stepped off the road onto the
cursed plains, but didn't put up much of a verbal fight.  Perhaps they were
inspired by the ease of passage thus far, or perhaps they were just glad to
be putting the awful reek of the city behind them.  We had camped on the
road for the night, again without incident, and so were opposed only by a
few large crabs as we traversed the plains to the mines.  Leycera led us
swiftly and surely, and we never had to face that rumored horror, the
maglat.  Perhaps it doesn't exist, I know not.

It was late morning when we reached the mines.  The entrance loomed in front
of us, dark and forbidding, and for moment I wondered about the wisdom of
this move.  But Prentirn entered without hesitation, a fine display of
courage.  And so, trusting to Leycera's judgment, I pushed the doubts aside
and followed.  If you have found this manuscript, you already know of what
these mines contain, so I will not provide excessive detail.  Time is
becoming more important now, and I fear I must hasten my narrative.

#DESCRIPTION How can I describe what we found in that horrible city?  And yet, our
experiences paled in comparison to what happened later.  Undead zombies
stalked through the place, ever a threat even though our trained mercenaries
made short work of each that wandered too close.  The stench was
overbearing, and it required a stiff force of will on at least my part to
continue.  I think it helped to reflect on what it would mean to turn back
alone now.

At one point we came across the form of a child, shuffling along in its
undeath.  What foulness possessed the king to so doom his kingdom? 
Fortunately, we didn't have to slay it, as the creature moved along away
from us.  We searched a great portion of the city, relying on Leycera's
sense of spirit to guide us to repositories of power.  In this manner we
found a run-down temple and several items of minor (and typically unholy)
strength.  The Dove, however, was not to be found.  As the day wore on, I
looked with increasing apprehension at the palace that loomed to the north. 
Surely, I felt, that was our next destination.  The mere rumor of what lay
within was enough to chill me to the bone, and I entertained little desire
to verify those tales.

As the day wore to a close, Leycera made the announcement.  Much to my
surprise, we were not to enter the palace, but rather seek out the mines.  I
supposed that it made sense, as the descendant of Arafia was one of the
miners in this place.  It would be several more days ere I realized that she
had to have known that would be our destination from the start.  Nothing
else makes sense - why else the excess of hired force?  Why else choose to
not search the palace, and why else give up so easily on the city?  Why else
prepare the orb?...  But I am getting ahead of myself.  At the time, I was
simply flooded with relief at not having to enter the palace.  Now, I wish
we had chosen the palace.  No.  I wish we had never come.

#DESCRIPTION We traveled the Dantaron, arriving at a possible mooring point sometime
in the late afternoon.  The place looked to have been a dock at one point,
but was quite overrun now.  A sign was posted -- "Warning!  To the west are
the cursed Plains of Shargob!  To enter is death!".  We tied up our boats
and proceeded to enter into our first squabble.  The Tarnan mercenaries
wanted to spend the night at the makeshift dock rather than risk the plains
by the night that was fast approaching.  Looking out over what I could see
of the barren lands to the west, I could see their point.  Leycera, however,
had different ideas.  And Leycera always got her way.  After a small
argument, we began trudging west, the mercenaries muttering amongst
themselves.  Soon we had left the boats behind, along with the unheeded
warning sign, which kept its grim watch over the docks.

After we had proceeded some leagues along an ancient road, the sun fell
behind the tall westerly mountains called the Yagash.  I could feel my heart
rate increase almost involuntarily.  It was almost an hour before I realized
my knuckles had grown white from gripping my staff.  Leycera, apparently
unfazed by the evil of the place, led the way.  She was infused with a soft
white light, and I could once again appreciate the extraordinary charisma
she possessed.  Somehow, I was comforted.

We arrived at a bend in the road without incident, despite the decidedly
unwholesome skitterings we heard from all around us.  There we made camp,
appointing several of the men to keep watch.  I think Leycera may have, as
well, but I was too exhausted to do much but sleep, and they didn't disturb
me until we were preparing to move on.  As I roused my sore muscles the
thought of soft couches and comfortable beds flashed across my mind, but I
quickly suppressed it.  Too much to do.

Sometime after noon, we reached the ruins of Gogoth city.

#DESCRIPTION We reached the port town of Var Bandor the evening of the 13th day of The
Reaping.  After being ferried across the Dantaron, we secured lodging at The
Journey's End, not too far from Bandor's main square.  Every time I came
here I liked it less and less, and this instance was no exception. 
Earendam, the city of my birth and youth, is far grander.

The next day we went to the Nymph's Tears to meet with the captain of the
mercenaries.  A tall human clad in the armor of the Tarnan mercenary house
and bearing a prepossessing grin, I liked him at once.  Later I learned he
had been a friend of Leycera's father, and was not unknown to Prentirn,
either.  The man's name was Damasd, and he was accompanied by a lieutenant
of sorts by the name of Fersn.  This latter I did not like from the moment I
laid eyes on him, and later events bore this intuition out.  His skin was a
noticeable shade lighter than the copper color of the captain, bordering on
sallow.  Several scars (from knife-fighting, I later learned) were evident
on his knuckles, and his smile seemed forced.  The rest of the men were of a
mixed sort and numbered six, not including Damasd or Fersn.

Leycera provided funds (where did she get all the money?)  for canoes, and
ere long our reinforced party was on its way down the Dantaron towards the
cursed plains of Shargob.  What fools we mortals be.

#DESCRIPTION When next I saw Leycera, I had grown myself into a respected journeywoman
in the Tower.  She had not in the meantime left the promise of her rapid
ascent unfulfilled, and there was much rumor that she would soon be named an
Archmage.  At the time, I had just finished delivering my thesis on the
Cousten meditation techniques, and was surprised to find her waiting for me
afterwards.  Surprised by her, yes, but even more so by the startling green
eyes of the human behind her.  His face was kindly and bestubbled with a
faint beard.  He comported himself with an unusual grace, and he seemed to
radiate charm.  Prentirn, I recalled, the famed swordmaster.  A quick glance
to the two elegant blades at his sides confirmed the recollection.  But why
was he here?

Leycera was complimenting me on the thesis.  Bringing my thoughts back to
the present, I flushed slightly in embarrassment.  We conversed for a brief
period, but she never introduced Prentirn or explained her visit.  When I
retired to my chambers that evening, however, it was not her face that
stayed in my mind as I drifted off, but his.

#DESCRIPTION I don't know how much longer I have, doubtless only a few hours, so I am
scribbling these pages in the hopes that one day my account might be found. 
Already the shadows draw close about me, and darkness seeks to overwhelm my
fading spirit...

It all started with Leycera, as most things did.  I first met her when I was
a mere pupil in the Tower of Salyra, when we received among our patients one
afflicted by a blight of the mind that mystified even the more advanced
journeymagi of the guild.  One of the masters recognized it as Void work,
and sent for a magus from the Order of the Silver Light.

I was tending a nearby patient when Leycera arrived.  Though she was less
than half of my eighteen years, already she was a respected journeywoman of
Spirit magics.  I had heard of her briefly as a rising genius of the Order,
but this was the first I had ever seen her.  Like most of her peculiar race,
her skin was a warm golden color, faintly translucent.  Her hair was long
and silvered, but not the silver of old age that I will not live to see. 
She entered with a grace and power that was evident even to one of my lowly
station, but no trace of haughtiness clouded her presence.  The power she
bore simply was, and she took it for granted as one of the rest of us might
regard an arm or leg.

It did not take her long to finish with the afflicted man, but ere she
departed I noticed that she cast a meaningful glance at me, as if somehow
knowing even then that our fates were to be so greatly intertwined.

#DESCRIPTION We took shifts lowering people.  It was possible to lower oneself, but
required more muscular effort.  Hence, the kankoran -- whose name I could
never pronounce, much less scribe -- was the last to go.  He was lowering
the last of the mercenaries down to the rest of us standing below when we
heard a terrific bellowing sound from above.

The horror of what was happening struck us at about the same time as the
cage struck the ground.  Hard.  The Tarnan warrior didn't stand a chance. 
Apparently, the mine shaft didn't either.  The impact of the device was
enough to shake the shaft, and bits of rock began falling from above.  It
soon turned into a shower of stone, accompanied by the roars of our kankoran
compatriot, who was fighting for his life at the top of the steep shaft.

Then the ceiling collapsed.  We fled into the mining tunnel to escape being
crushed.  It suddenly occurred to me that despite the distate I had borne
for Var Bandor, I would have given anything to have been back there.  I do
not know what happened to the trusty kankoran, nor the orb he carried.  Both
were missed sorely over the next two days, measuring by the sleeping periods
we attempted to observe.

We made camp in a dark bend in the tunnel, leaving fully half of our
remaining complement to stand guard.  It was the first I had seen Leycera
actually look worried.

#DESCRIPTION Three months later Prentirn's presence was suddenly explained.  The news
of the wedding of the famed swordmaster to the archmage spread quickly, and
much talk of it abounded in the Tower, as well.  Much to my surprise, I was
invited.  The ceremony itself was a formal occasion, but has little bearing
on this recanting.  I must move on, as the protective glow continues to
fade.

It was a full two years before I saw Leycera again.  I was in my study,
pouring over a text by Tresacran on the theory of elementals when she
appeared suddenly in my doorway.  She cut her usual graceful figure, clad in
shimmering silver robes and radiating excitement.  "I think I've found it!" 
She said.  The uncustomary entrance and greeting caught me off-guard, but I
quickly regained my composure and offered her a seat.  Declining, she paced
about the room, speaking rapidly.

"I have for some years now been studying ancient artifacts, attempting to
discern their powers, purposes, and whereabouts.  The past year I have
dedicated to finding the Dove of Arafia, an amulet of considerable power. 
And I think I have it!"

Leycera continued her rant for some time, and slowly her enthusiam spread to
me.  Apparently, her research had uncovered that the Dove had passed down
the line of Arafia, a line that dwindled in renown as the ages passed. 
Though the story of Arafia's descent into the Nether Pits for his lover is
well-known, there are few tales indeed of any heroic deeds performed by his
descendants.  At length the Dove came into the possession of the last of his
line, a simple mine worker living in the realm of Gogoth.  When the foul
King's curse fell upon the kingdom, all knowledge of the Dove passed from
mortal memory.  But not if Leycera was to have her way.  She was proposing a
journey to the undead city itself, in search of the Dove.  And she wanted me
along.

#DESCRIPTION If there is one thing to be said of Leycera, it is that she always
managed to get her way.  We set out within the week.  The plan was to make
the trip to Var Bandor first, to prepare our supplies and rendevous with the
rest of our party.  Apparently, this meant a small band of mercenaries from
Ashta Harrud that Leycera had secured some time before in anticipation of
the journey.  From Bandor we would press on to the Undead City itself.

The trip along the Arien Road was largely uneventful, the way I liked it. 
Besides Leycera, Prentirn, and myself, there was only one attendant with us,
a hulking kankoran with a gruff appearance and surprisingly pleasant
demeanor.  We made quite a spectacle.  Two humans, a ch'taren, and a
kankoran moving purposefully west together cannot fail to raise eyebrows,
especially when one is a famous warrior and the other an almost
equally-renowned archmage.

Leycera and Prentirn spent much time together, and I could not help but feel
a twinge of jealousy for her.  Men of his kind did not come by often.  I
thought then -- and know now -- that I spent too much time on my studies. 
But alas, naught can be done at this point.

#LORE The Archmage Leycera, in preparation for her sojourn to the cursed mines
of Gogoth, devised this orb.  The technicalities of its workings are
intricate and detailed, but the general concept is not difficult to
understand.  The orb, having been imbued with potent Spirit magic,
rigorously searches for souls that have been twisted in such a way as to be
denied Salvation or Damnation.  Upon discovering these souls adequately
detached from their hold on the Prime Materium, the power of the orb bends
the spirit in such a way as to permit it passage.  

The details of how the renowned Archmagus lost the orb are not widely-known,
but one immutable fact has been oft-discussed amongst the learned: after
entering the mines, she was ne'er seen amongst the living again.

supply center, for small metal tools litter the floor and counters.  Several
rusted mining pick heads hang from hooks in the walls, their handles rotted
away.  A small drawer is set into the counter beneath them.  There is a
cabinet in the northwest corner of the shed, filled with broken lanterns.  A
small wooden stool sits in the center of the room.  The place reeks of decay
and rot.  One window is evident in the north wall, but it is little more
than a square hole through which light can pass.  A few sketches of the
mining operation are strewn about the place, mostly rotted away.  A

#DESCRIPTION The north and east walls of this passage have been partially scored by
mining pickaxes.  The south side is an oddity, for it is composed not of a
solid slab of rock like most of the walls in the mine, but rather a large
pile of rubble, as if formed in some sort of cave-in.  The black stone walls
are decorated with several bits of some shiny substance, which sparkle in
greater profusion in the most western parts of the passage.  A slight breeze
comes from the west, carrying with it cool, moist air.  It would appear that
a large cavern opens up to the west, but all other sides of this short
tunnel seem impassable.

with the stone fragments and wall chippings so pervasive in other parts of

Several stalagmites rise from the ground, formed of black mineral deposits
over a long period of time.  A gentle breeze blows from above, assaulting
you with cool, moist air.  It seems to be coming from a sort of ventilation
shaft which must somehow extend outside to the surface of the Yagash
Mountains.  However, the aperture through which the breeze descends is far
too small to permit entrance.  The floor is a bit damp, but otherwise clear.

by the southern wall of the shaft, apparently designed to transport miners
up and down.  The chain that once connected its roof to the pulleys far
above has long since rusted away, leaving behind only a heavily oxidized
length of metal.  The air is fairly still down here, bearing with it a
faintly musty taste.  The walls are composed of a dark brown rock that
becomes nearly black in the more northerly part of the shaft.  Navigating
carefully around the pile of rubble, you could enter the tunnel that leads
off to the north.  On all other sides the hard stone walls preclude
movement.

#NAME A Broad Mine Shaft
#DESCRIPTION A long wall of black stone runs along the western side of this tunnel,
chipped and torn in the miners' quest for precious materials.  The air is
still and vaguely moist here, smelling of mold.  The passage is cool in
temperature, bordering on lukewarm.  A slightly smaller shaft branches off
to the east.  The main passage runs north to an intersection, as well as
south into further darkness.

carries the faint scent of mildew.  Chips of stone are intermingled with the

debris to the sides of the passageway, leaving the center clear.

Emerald-hued bubbles rise to the surface of the pool, bursting and releasing
an acrid gas into the air with a faint hissing sound.  A sharply acidic
smell fills the place, and bits of the gas cling to you, irritating wherever
it touches.  The ground around the ichor rises only a couple of inches above
it.  Subtle movements are evident in the pool, causing the occasional ripple
to flow out to its perimeter.  The sticky substance gives off a green light,
illuminating this section of the mines.  A passage branches off to the north
on one bank, while across from it another extends to the east.

nourishment of the rotting flesh.  The ensuing oophagia amongst the other
chateirae soon makes it clear why this race has not managed to explode

sharply downward in a steep decline, the bottom of which seems to curve

of shiny mineral seem to end abruptly towards the eastern part of this

#NAME A Grey-Stoned Passage
#DESCRIPTION Lines of an alabaster hue form striae in the otherwise grey stone which
composes the walls of this passage.  Shadows dance about the walls, more
evident than in the darker regions of the mines.  The air is heavy and thick
with moisture, and begins to grow a bit chilly to the north.  The hard stone
ground is slick and damp.  A few stalagmites rise up near the eastern wall,
slowly forming from the mineral deposits in the dripping water.  The tunnel
continues north and south, and a small side passage slopes downward to the
west.

this tunnel.  Warm air enters from the south, but the more northerly reaches
seem to hint of a slight chill.  The passage is naturally arched, and the
ceiling rises high above you.  The tunnel extends to the north and south.

into a hot, wet cavern.  North, the tunnel continues in the darkness.

obscuring view of the slick ground.  Several odd formations of stone
decorate the place, twisting and contorting in unusual angles.  The stone is
greyish, and flecks of white are imbedded in it.  The air here is cool save
for near the east wall.  There, the stone forms into a sort of pedestal. 
Four thick stalagmites thrust up from the ground in the northwest corner of
the cavern, forming a sort of basin in which water has pooled.  The cavern
continues to the south, where more strange stone shapes loom.

#NAME Within the Dark Mists of Sleep
#DESCRIPTION Dark mists swirl all about you in this place, obscuring vision for more
than perhaps half a foot.  The air is damp and chill, and a certain sense of
hollowness seems to pervade your surroundings.  Natural light here is all
but absent, consisting completely of a very faint glow which is nearly
swallowed in its entirety by the preternatural gloom.

#NAME Code Changes in New Build -- Suggestions
#DESCRIPTION * Make it so ghosts cannot die except in certain circumstances
* Allow all commands usually done by an imm -- from bg reading to
  initiating/deinitiating snoops to statting to note reading -- to be
  done by an imm while switched.  
* ^ also wiznet stuff ^ 
* [Dov] Make the time/lunar/weather systems function correctly and
  allow for prog interaction based on them.  
* [Dov] Real-world physics like air and water room autochecking for
   dropping/falling/sinking if there are down exits. 
* [Dov] Have a working act_prog -- it could really simplify a lot of
  messy prog triggering.  
* [Dov] add a 'contiguous areas' field to the the area files 
* [Dov] get rid of shopkeeper hours, or make non-open shoppies 
  'go home'/wizi/somesuch.  
* [Iandir] ability to reload areas instantly, including items 
* [Iac] A one-week delay on delete, putting a character on semi-deleted 
  hold.  To let people cool down.  
* [Iac] More stratification of spells into greater/lesser 
* A 'sheathe' command that frees the wield wearslots, with a memory
  of the weapons sheathed (for automatic wielding in case of combat).
* Make it so that you can sleep on a mat in your inventory, and when
  you stand up it goes back into your inv.
* [Dov] a 'journal' command that would show TONS of stats, such
  as top 5 groupmates, top 5 NPCs killed, PK stats, top 5 areas.
  Could be an account bonus?
* http://www.avendar.com/avendarbible/wiki.pl?Guilds_And_Levelless_Classes_For_Av_2.0
* [Dov] Make the School of Heroes more IC (replace newb exits with progs?)
* [Iac] Make wall exit-flags, so ch'taren can run through them.
* Diversify spell parameters, add spell-type flags to each spell.
* [Kor] Implement the spell system as a database parser, with spells
  (their side-affects and echoes) as entries in a database.  Allow
  builders access to a spell-editor to add custom spell entries.
* [Kor] Keep a hash table of spell names for progging purposes, so
  that builders can refer directly to spell names instead of having
  to look up spell numbers.
* [Kor] XML-like tagging syntax for prog arguments, instead of static
  syntax.  e.g., mpaddaffect (spellnum) 30 -->
  mpaddaffect level='30' spell='spellname' foo='bar' otherarg='whatever'
* [Iac] Autotagging of vnums into name fields of objs/mobs
* [Iac] Hardcoded warnings (to players) and flags (for imms) for the more
  common rule violations - TMR, off-account, multikilling, etc.
