#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
The dark seething mass of the Chayrin oozes along the cave floor, in its
insatiable search for sustenance.  The dark mass is made up of irregular
looking lumps and protrusions, all covered by the midnight black ooze of its
body.  It gives off a dark miasma of rot and decay.  The Chayrin is spread
across a wide expanse of the cave floor, though the actual length changes as
the lumps of its body mutate in size and appearance.  Its height is also
impossible to gauge perfectly due to its ever-shifting nature.  Over a dozen
tentacles extend from its body at various locations.  The tentacles vary in
size even as you watch, as the Chayrin redistributes its mass at its whim.

A wounded water templar rests here against the wall of the alcove.  You

the armor he wears.  His head bleeds from a large cut so deep that you can
see the white bone of his skull.  Another massive slash across his chest
which reveals his ribs show how close to death he is.  His blue eyes are
glassy and unfocused as he rests in a crimson pool of his own blood.

She looks to weigh over eight hundred pounds.  Her shell shows the marks of
a lifetime of fighting for her survival.  Her brown leathery skin is
wrinkled with the toil of age.  Due to her seniority she has chosen this
choice spot as her nest, far away from the other turtles.

will capture small prey and use its tentacles to sting it to submission

Nestled deep within the Lidraeu Sea is the office of Benedir Arcel. 
There are no walls to the office, instead each of the four corners is marked
by a white marble Corinthian column.  Between each of the columns is empty
space, allowing for a perfect unimpeded view of the sea outside.  The
columns themselves bear fine blue runes that pulse with a gentle beat,
keeping the water at bay, and shielding this office from sight.  The middle
of the office is dominated by a large mahogany U-shaped desk which holds a
variety of paperwork and other essentials.  A plush leather chair sits
behind the desk.  The light for the office is provided by a shimmering white
mage-globe that levitates above the desk.  A soothing array of music is
softly played within the office, giving it an overall relaxing atmosphere.

Beneath the powerful waves of the Lidraeu Sea, the currents and eddies
still manifest themselves in their gentle pushing and pulling.  The light
from above is slanted and spread here beneath the waves, causing a myriad of
different sea creatures to be illuminated.  The grey waters of the Lidraeu
now take a slightly greenish tint from the contents of the sea that swirl
about you.  Small fishes swim in groups, and singularly, in the quest for
food and survival.  Clumps of seaweed reach eagerly from the sandy bottom to
the light that shines from above.  All about you the scene continues, except
to the south where the seafloor drops to a lower depth, and to the northwest
where a small group of underwater hills are present.

#DESCRIPTION
Here between a small group of underwater hills and the approaching shore
line there is a quieter region of water.  The grey waters of the Lidraeu now
take a slightly greenish tint from the contents of the sea that swirl about
you.  The still water gently supports your weight as you look about and
notice the plant life that have taken advantage of the hills to root
themselves there.  Occasionally small fishes will nibble briefly upon the
plants and then swim adeptly away in their pursuit of food.  To the east and
west navigation is possible, while to the north the shoreline makes further
swimming unfeasible.

brilliant shades of red to deep shades of blue.  Various other plant life
also grow here, including a variety of seaweed.  The water here is a bit
colder, indicating that you are farther away from the volcanic vents that

east, where a large intersection of coral reefs are present.

Even above your head stretches an arched reef that had anchored itself to
the curved reefs to the east and west.  This arched reef begrudgingly allows
a few slivers of light from the surface through, making the dominant light
here the dull red glow of the volcanic vents.  Small, nimble, fish dart in
and out of this arched reef, relishing their freedom and life.

#NAME A Dead End
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
The coral reefs come to an abrupt dead-end here.  The polyps here grow so
close that they form an almost seamless wall.  Even the smallest tilefish
appears to have trouble squeezing through the coral.  A volcanic vent is
present on the seafloor here, providing the necessary heat and nutrients to
this coral reef.  The curved formation of the coral reef blocks off further
travel in any direction, but to the east.  Dotted amongst the reef are
various sized oysters which have chosen this spot for their home.  The
oysters range from small ones that are barely two inches in diameter, to one
large one that is roughly two feet in length.  There are a few open oyster
shells scattered about on the sandy seafloor, indicating that other
creatures have found the oysters an appetizing meal.

seafloor.  Many of the coral reefs form around these small volcanic vents,
depending upon them for warmth and nutrients.  The passageways that have
been formed over the years into the coral reefs are, however, often random

the curved structure of this reef is too dense for further navigation.  You
see a large number of starfish have attached themselves to this reef,
complacent in their role in this tight knit ecosystem.  Their sizes range
from miniscule, to a select few that are over a foot long in length.  A
number of them appear injured, with wounded or missing appendages.  The
almost magical ability of these starfish, however, seem to be regenerating
even the missing body parts with amazing alacrity.  The only possible route
out of this curved reef is to retrace your way back west, to the large
intersection of coral reefs.

The coral reefs surrounding you to the east and west appear both smaller
and less dense as they extend farther south.  The waters here have a general
southwesterly pull, and even as you watch stray debris and broken pieces of
coral drift towards that direction.  This stretch of the coral reefs also
seems less inhabited by normal sea creatures found to the north.  Here it
looks as if this ecosystem is not thriving, but merely surviving.  To the
north you see the coral reefs open to reveal an open expanse of sea floor,
and to the south the coral reefs continue to grow smaller and less dense.

to the south, where its center is.  The bottom of the whirlpool is
impossible to detect, due to the depth of the valley.  To all appearances
the whirlpool is dragging its victims to an unknown abyss.  To the east the

sustain itself in such an environment.  You see to the west the cause of all
this, the underwater cone of a large whirlpool.  The bottom of the
whirlpool, however, appears to reach far deeper than the current level of
the seafloor you are on.  The seafloor is also slightly sloped downwards to
the west, giving the whole region a bowl-like appearance.  The water here is
cold due to the depth and absence of any large quantity of sunlight.  To the
east you see the coral reefs growing upon the seafloor.

Placed between two small rocky hills lies a large nest.  The nest is over

is made from mainly scattered pieces of dead coral that have been stacked
together.  Occasionally a few pieces of skeletons of various sea creatures
were also used to make the nest.  The water here is peaceful, with only a
few small fish swimming about.  The two hills provide the perfect shelter
for this nest, protecting it even from the faint current pulling to the
west.  Littered on the sand before the nest are over a dozen different sized
tortoise shells.  Most of these shells are chipped and broken from age, and
the years they have been neglected on the seafloor.  The only exit lies back
to the quiet water to the west.

You can see a few dark shapes moving about slowly at the bottom of the

A gray slate of unabated churning waters stretches throughout the area,
and continues most prominently to the south and west.  To the north is a
small rocky peninsula that stretches from the mainland.  Farther to the east
is a sheer cliff face which stoically withstands the constant assault of the
powerful waves that beat against it.  Beneath the surface of the water,
small fishes can be seen swimming about in groups.  Even deeper under the
surface of the water the sandy seafloor can barely be seen.
