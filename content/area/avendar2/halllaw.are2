living tissue.  When you allow your gaze to fall upon his face, you notice
only a smooth face with a prominent nose and no eyes that is composed of the
same cold, blackened steel.  The figure is at once ominous and fascinating.

Here stand what remains of Jidriln and Biezkul. Formerly mighty warriors of

bargained with the Demon Courts of Logor. Their ill-advised dealings with
the Void left them unable to fulfill their duties as Guardians.
  
They stand here today as a warning to all Guardians. Do not lust for power;
do not let zeal for Law become blindness; and do not betray your duty to the

by the Guardians, and will be enforced mercilessly. Any who break the 
law will be marked for a Reward. They will then be hunted by the 
Guardians, and indeed by many of the land, for the god Iandir will 
reward their killer. For more information about rewards, read the scroll 
entitled "help reward".
Areas designated as law-observant are as follows: Var Bandor, Krilin 
Fortress, Earendam, and the Hall of Law.
1. Any person who attacks another person in a law-observant area will be 
marked for a reward. Members of the Guardians may attack one who has 
been marked at any time, for it is their calling to punish the 
law-breakers. Guardians may choose to deputize non-chaotic people, who 
are then temporarily allowed to attack criminals in law-observant areas. 
These are the only exceptions.
2. Any person who steals or attempts to steal from another within a law-
observant area will be marked for a reward. The following offenses will 
be considered theft: Taking items from another person's corpse without
the owner's consent, taking items from the corpse of a recently-slain
criminal, stealing items from another person's pet or mercenary or the 
corpse thereof, and the actual act of stealing an item from another 
person's possession. Members of the Guardians of Law, or deputies operating 
under the instructions of a member of the Guardians of Law may at times take
items from a person's corpse in the line of duty. This includes holding
items to prevent theft and confiscating items to punish an offender.
 
3. Any person who attacks a guildguard within a law-observant area will 
be marked for a reward. Guardians of Law may attack guildguards in 
pursuit of criminals.
4. Any non-Guardian who enters the Hall of Law will be marked for a reward.
5. Any person who recklessly uses a deadly skill within a law-observant
area will be marked for a reward. A deadly skill will be defined as a
skill or spell that can cause bodily damage to a person. Reckless use will
be defined as use that has the potential to affect bystanders (ie, area-
affect spells). Included are skills that make an area dangerous to
travel, such as Wall of Fire or traps.
 
6. Any person who directly aids a marked person will also be marked for 
a reward. This includes supplying the marked person with potions, 
scrolls, healing, refreshment, food, water, weapons, armor, and other 
means of aid. Those who choose a marked person as a travelling companion 
are advised to be very cautious, lest they run afoul of the law.

#KEYWORDS  deputies
#DESCRIPTION The deputization process consists of confirming that a non-chaotic person
is willing to act as a deputy, then declaring them to be a deputy.  The
Guardian should inform all other Guardians of the deputization.  The deputy
may then legally attack criminals within a law-observant area.  Usually
deputization is declared for the duration of one specific task, such as
bringing a certain criminal or criminals to justice.  Deputization never
continues after either Guardian or deputy has left the land.  A deputy may
attack criminals, but must obey all other laws as written.

#KEYWORDS  witnesses
#DESCRIPTION Witnesses may be accepted as evidence, provided that there are two or
more people (other than the victim) who can verify that the crime took
place.  (Or, of course, one Guardian.)  The testimony of known criminals or
chaotic persons should be disregarded.  A confession of a crime, delivered
to a Guardian, is always considered sufficient evidence.  

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  marks
#DESCRIPTION When a Guardian has gathered sufficient evidence that a person has
committed a crime, the Guardian must mark the person for a Reward.  If the
evidence is insufficient, the Guardian must either continue investigation,
or drop the case.  It is better to be sure of a person's guilt before
placing a mark, rather than placing a mark and then seeking answers.  If you
are unsure of how to proceed in a given situation, always ask a senior
Guardian, or write a scroll to all Guardians concerning the matter. 
Guardians who err only tarnish their house's reputation.  Once a person is
determined to be guilty, they must be punished.  Pardons are never to be
granted unless the mark was wrongfully placed.  

When marking a criminal, the Guardian should tell the violator why they
are being punished. At minimum, they should know which law they broke.

#DESCRIPTION The Guardians of Law are a regimented force, divided by their home town

Guardians are based in their hometowns, and hold jurisdiction there.  A
native guardian can overturn a mark made by a non-native Guardian of equal
or lesser rank, if he feels it is unjust and incorrect.  The native
Guardians of a given town are lead by the town Leader, if one exists.  The
Guardian Leader of a town holds final judgement on all marks in his city,
and answers only to the Guardian Leader in matters of his guarded city.  

The Leader of House Guardian holds final judgement in all marks.  

Guardians who have served the Halls of Law for twenty years are marked as
Senior Guardians, and hold rank over those who have not served at least
twenty years.  Those who have served for fifty years are known as Elder
Guardians, and hold rank over those who have not served at least over fifty
years.  The Town Leaders and the Guardian Leader hold rank over Elder and
Senior guardians.  

A Town Leader can enter without violence the guilds of his city by speaking
the words 'Allow me entrance.  ' The Leader of the Guardians may access
guilds in any city in this way as well.  This power is to be used ONLY in
the pursuit of criminals.  Abuse of this for any other reason will result in
removal from house Guardian.

help reward. This power requires no stones for its use.
 
The second-tier power of the Guardian House is known as Perception. This
skill allows the Guardian to see hidden and invisible beings. A Guardian

of the yelling whether a citizen is truly being attacked, or is trying to
deceive. This power currently requires two stones for its use.

damage caused by a criminal. It will also block one-fourth of the damage
caused by those of chaotic mind. This power requires four stones for its
use.

#NAME The Guardian Helpfile Rider Room
#DESCRIPTION The Guardians of Law are a regimented force, divided by their home town
and time served.  

Guardians are based in their hometowns, and hold jurisdiction there.  A
native guardian can overturn a mark made by a non-native Guardian of equal
or lesser rank, if he feels it is unjust and incorrect.  The native
Guardians of a given town are lead by the town Leader, if one exists.  The
Guardian Leader of a town holds final judgement on all marks in his city,
and answers only to the Guardian Leader in matters of his guarded city.  

The Leader of House Guardian holds final judgement in all marks.  

Guardians who have served the Halls of Law for twenty years are marked as
Senior Guardians, and hold rank over those who have not served at least
twenty years.  Those who have served for fifty years are known as Elder
Guardians, and hold rank over those who have not served at least over fifty
years.  The Town Leaders and the Guardian Leader hold rank over Elder and
Senior guardians.
