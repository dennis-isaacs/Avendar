A grizzled old sailor who has lost his right leg above the knee, this

say Aye, I was twenty one, and the village girls were all over me.

emote chortles gleefully.
say I had to fight them off, though of course not too hard.
emote pauses for a moment, lost in thought.
say Well, anyway, my friends and I had a ship, a fine ship she was.
say Not very large, but sturdy.  You could count on her.
say Built her with my own two hands I did, cut the trees for her too.
2
say We did all our own work then, not like these days.
emote shakes his head sadly.
2
emote gazes out into the distance as he continues.
say The day was slightly overcast, with a brisk wind.
say We sailed out into the sea, and let out our nets.
say I had feeling though, and dropped my line as well.
say The hours passed, and we were getting a good haul.
say I stuck to my line though, cause my feeling was strong.
say Ha, and then he came.  The big one, a real monster.
say Grabbed my line and dragged the whole ship along.
2
say My friends tried to help bring him in, but I waved them off.
emote waves his hands in demonstration.
say If I couldn't bring him in, they wouldn't have been able to help.
say He must have pulled her a good league before my line snapped.
say Ha.  Disappeared completely after that, he did.
say Never heard tell of him again, must have scared him off.
say One of these days he'll appear again though, and I'll have him.

emote trails off, nodding to himself.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Due to the decrease of trade brought on by the War of Night and the need
to protect the citizens of the city, the port was not rebuilt during the
war.  A few small buildings were erected to handle the trade that did come
in, though even these were abandoned when the city was in danger.  

Following the war's end, the senate quickly ordered the rebuilding of the
harbor, as they knew that the sea trade would help stabilize the Republic's
finances.  It was during this rebuilding that the great lighthouse, whose
plans had sat untouched since before the war, was finally constructed,
rising above the headland at the northern end of the harbor.  

The sea trade began to flourish once more, though, with Earendam severely
weakened militarily, piracy was a greater danger than it had been before the
war.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION According to popular myth, Earendam's port was originally founded by
Iraren, the grandson of the city's founder.  Most historians, however,
believe that the original port grew gradually as a result of the increasing
importance of the sea trade to Earendam's economy.  

During the short period immediately preceding the War of Night, the port
grew substantially in size, as many built homes along the shore.  The port
reached its peak of prominence during this time, and plans were drawn up for
a great lighthouse to replace the simple structure of the time.  

An unforunate disaster then struck the port.  An oil lamp was knocked over
during a tavern brawl, and the tavern went up in flames.  The port, a vast,
sprawling collection of closely built wooden structures, was ripe fuel for
the fires, and soon all that was left were the charred ruins of the once
vibrant port.  Many lost their homes and fortunes to the flames, though
fortunately few lives were lost.

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION During the invasion of the red-furred kankoran hordes, the port was
destroyed once more.  With all the military forces arrayed to protect the
city, the port was left defenseless and ripe for plunder.  Nothing remained
of the port except for the great lighthouse, which stood untouched by the
hordes.  It is unknown why the lighthouse remained unscathed, though some
scholars attribute this to superstition on the part of the kankoran.  

The port was immediately rebuilt after that attack in close to its present
form, and a barracks was established to help guard the port from further
destruction.  With the conclusion of the kankoran wars, the port once more
began its rise to prominence.  Under the competent leadership of a
succession of skilled harbormasters, the port has once again become a center
of trade.

calm waters of the Earendam Harbor, while to the east the gray expanse of
the Uthlin Ocean is visible.  A small path runs north, towards a small

#DESCRIPTION
Sheltered by the headland at the northeast end of the bay, the gray
waters of the Earendam Harbor are calm and gentle.  Many merchant ships lay
at anchor in the bay, impeding the passage of the fishing boats and smaller
vessels which traverse the harbor's waters.  The smell of the sea fills the
air, and the cries of gulls are heard as they glide through the sky.  To the
south, the shipyards of the port are visible, while to the north the
towering form of the great lighthouse can be seen rising from the headland. 
The harbor continues to the west, but opens to the east into the Uthlin
Ocean.
