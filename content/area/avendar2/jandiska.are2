unwavering.  At his feet the words "Iandir, Keeper of Law" are carved into a
plaque.  

Facing southwest is the granite statue of a caladaran woman swathed from
head to toe in robes, only her downcast face revealed.  Her expression is at
once both humble and committed as she holds in her right hand a staff and in
the other a cloth.  A plaque at her feet bears the carved words "Alajial,
Keeper of Peace".

#DESCRIPTION {WTHE CALADARAN{n
                         by Bii'ghoi ei'Rolok
  
  
  
The caladaran are a peaceful people, given to contemplation of the ways
and nature of Avendar.  Tall and thin, with a stoney, bark-like skin, the
bodies of caladaran resemble walking sticks.  Their faces are more
humanoid,with most caladaran showing little signs of age for most of their
life.
  
Caladaran first appear in human records shortly before the formal
beginning of the Republic of Earendam.  First noted as wanderers from the
east and south, the caladaran brought with them the magics of earth, though
they also rapidly took to the healing arts which had so dominated following
the War of Fire.  The caladaran also brought with them the worship of
Iandir, who embodied the principles most of the caladaran lived by. 
Previously worshipped only as a noncorporeal force, the devotion to order
and Law became a religion among some humans, giving rise to the first
codified set of laws (laid down by the nobles of the aelin Ipsoli line) as
well as the written script used as the basis for the common tongue today.

#KEYWORDS  book2
#DESCRIPTION For as long as caladaran have been known, they have served as teachers
and healers, though seldom as warriors or men of the sword.  Preferring a
solitary lifestyle, they will nevertheless live in cities or towns if it
suits their purposes (their healers in particular). 
  
Among themselves, the caladarans have a council of sages, which meets
infrequently and typically only over matters of grave importance, preferring
to let local rulers and laws deal with day to day problems.

#DESCRIPTION The Shuddeni:
The shuddeni represent an intellect to rival that of our kind.  While we
seek harmony, however, they seek domination.  Their bent is malevolent and
martial.  Theirs is a will to take and to possess.  In civilized lands we
must work against their overtures to gain a measure of authority in
Avendar's cities.  In the wilds, we must defend our homes against their
malevolent sorcery and chaja slaves.  Nothing of lasting good comes of a
relationship with a shuddeni.  Keep that in mind during your dealings with
them.  
  
The Srryn:
The srryn are a vicious, but conflicted race.  One branch of their
lineage lurks in the fetid swamps of Avendar, seeking to bring death and
destruction to all other races and their civilizations.  Yet, there are
those who separate themselves from their savage brethren and take up lives
within the cities, and some even protecting the Laws of Iandir that define
them.  It is fortunate that the these two disparate cultures are easily
discerned from one another.

#KEYWORDS  volume4
#DESCRIPTION The Humans:
Humans, taken as a race, are unpredictable and fickle.  Taken
individually, once you understand their goals, they can be influenced as any
other might be.  They wax in power as a race and it would be best for all
that they are well-advised on how to use this newfound influence.  It would
not do for it to be wielded at the expense of order and peace.  
  
The Kankoran:
The Kankoran share our affinity for the wild places of Avendar, but as a
race they oppose ordered societies on principle.  Many of our less involved
brethren live amongst them unmolested, but those of us who guard the Laws
of Iandir that our people brought to Avendar often find ourselves matching
our spells with their blades.  It is an unfortunate state of affairs, but
neither side will yield in this seemingly endless conflict.  
  
The Nefortu:
It is best to exercise the wisdom of Iandir when dealing with the
Nefortu.  Deception is bred in their bones, but vision is infused into ours.
With sound judgement we may sift the truth from the words of a nefortu as a
Ryarl panner may sift gold from mere dross.  In the civil courts of the land
we must work quietly to reign in their devious schemes.  It is well for
Avendar's cities we are so vigilant.

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#KEYWORDS  volume3
#DESCRIPTION The Chaja:
If the alatharya exercise their might without vision, the chaja do so
without mercy.  They are better manipulated from afar or avoided altogether.
Such physical might coupled with a vicious temperament make them unsafe
company.  Those that serve their shuddeni masters still are angry at their
bondage.  Those that have escaped are angry at once being bound, and those
born free are merely angry.  
  
The Ch'taren:
The ch'taren live their lives at the manic pace suiting one of the
shortest-lived races.  It may not be out of the question for me to witness
many generations of one of these golden-skinned families in the course of my
life.  They are erratic but well-meaning, a few zealously so.  Their chaotic
nature makes them difficult to work with.  They lack patience or a
willingness to take a long view of a conflict.  Fortunately they also lack
malice, which makes many of their other qualities more tolerable.  
  
The Ethron:
No other race is so akin to us, yet so different as the hearty and
sagacious ethron.  Physically, we are opposites.  They are short, stout and
solid while we are taller and of a more scholarly making.  But we share a
wisdom and appreciation for the wilds of Avendar that transcends our obvious
differences.  Even those of us who reside in a city often feel the tug for
the solitude of the forest.  Many an ethron village has a caladaran advisor
residing in the nearby woods.

#DESCRIPTION Volume 7- The Caladaran, by Astiljisi, Scholar of Spirit and Advisor to
                 Rhentil, Secretary of Danrasad
  
The Aelin:
The aelin are a proud race, but not too proud to seek our advice in
matters of import.  It is in this manner we may curb their natural excesses.
We must wield their power subtly, as not to arouse their awareness of it. 
Should an aelin believe he is being led to an idea that is not of his own
'flawless' devising, his stubborn pride will not allow him to embrace it. 
No matter how wise the idea may be.  
  
The Alatharya:
The brutish alatharya exercise their might with a single-minded lack of
vision.  For us, this is a double-edged sword in our dealings with them.  As
allies, they are often oblivious to our subtle coaching.  There is simply no
way to conspire with one due to their singular lack of guile.  As foes, they
may not detect our hand in events, no matter how obvious.  When the weapons
are loosed, however, it is better to have them on your side, but a good
distance away.  They swing wild.

#DESCRIPTION Cursed and Haunted Avendar

The mystical scars that mark the land of Avendar are many.  Since the
Sundering conflict and magic have swept over the lands and the pain of their
passing has left an unshakeable blight.  

Are such places the work of the Dragon, whose true name I shall not write? 
The stench of black sorcery hangs heavy over such places.  Was Gogoth's fall
not the result of a pact with dark powers, perhaps the Dragon himself?  Were
the people of Shendaer cursed by demonic powers?  If this is true, perhaps
these places reflect where the unholy has dragged its claws over our world. 
The first wounds inflicted by a creature intent of finishing its fell task.

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#KEYWORDS  slim2
#DESCRIPTION Or perhaps it the deaths of many that causes anguish enough to leave a
scar in the very fabric of being?  The deaths at the great battle of Nordath
may be caused by such, although the truth is not known.  Perhaps some great
war, long forgotten, took place in the fens to cause it to become such a
place of spiritual rot.  

Only investigation and divination will yield the truest answers in the
fullness of time.  Eventually the old ghosts of Avendar may yet rest and the
tulmult of cursed magic may ebb and fade.  For now it appears that such will
not be the case for decades to come, however.

blotchy lettering, as from a cheap woodcut press: 

The torn scraps of parchment fluttered through the air
like butterflies into the warm night. Duana sighed as
she watched them dance away in the breeze from her balcony.
If only the words upon them had been so poetic.  For three
nights now that maelific roustabout Baron Maeladr had
been trying to woo her with scraps of turgid poetry. Tears
glittered in her sparkling eyes as she longed for her
true love. It had been four days since she had seen Saeldar
sail over the cliff with the Baron's foul kankoran thug..

#NAME An Ascending Mountain Path
#DESCRIPTION This narrow mountain path climbs its way across a rugged rock face which
grows increasingly more broken to the north and east.  The jagged brown rock
becomes smoother to the west.  A massive protrusion of rock juts out from
the mountainside which rises to the east, a dim space showing beneath.  The
trail vanishes among the rocks to the north, winding and twisting to pass
between the many boulders and other obstacles which are strewn through this
mountain pass.  Moss and lichens are spread sparsely about the stone.  The
air is thin and cool.

row of young pines.  Their branches have been masterfully woven together in
a sort of topiary wall, forming an impenetrable, natural hedge.  At the
corners of the clearing, four massive poplars rise above the young pines,
four large branches reaching for the center of the open space.  Among these
stately rafters a living ceiling of thick grapevine has been woven, the
growth thick and verdant.  The ground beneath is covered in a rich growth of
springy moss, soft and comfortable.  A natural outcropping of stone sits at
the back end of the pavilion.  To the east, an opening in the hedge leads
down a short path into the pine forest.

#NAME The Eastern Outskirts of Jandiska Village
#DESCRIPTION A soft carpet of grass covers the earth on the outskirts of Jandiska
Village.  The entrance to the humble settlement lies on the western end of
this clearing; little more than a break in the trees that densely surround
the settlement.  Few tents and campsites have been set up on the green by
visitors to the village and the smell of cookfires lingers in the mountain
air.  A path leads down to the east through densely forested trails.

#NAME A Shadowy Graveyard
#DESCRIPTION Mossy gravestones rise from the loamy earth of this cemetery, cloaked in
perpetual shadow by dense foliage and the looming age-bitten facade of
nearby buildings.  The paths that once wound through the graveyard are now
overgrown and weed-choked from neglect and a low, clinging mist seems to
linger about the stones regardless of weather.  A wrought-iron gate
separates the graveyard from the path to the south and a wooden door leads
into the low stone building that stands as the lot's western border.  The
graves continues to the north.

#KEYWORDS  stones graves
#DESCRIPTION The names on the stones are worn by time and the elements as to be
unreadable for the most part.  The largest of the graves is a wide granite
tombstone, draped in ropes of mossy vine.

#NAME The Ruins of a Temple
#DESCRIPTION The skeleton of what was once a temple looms all around you.  The
age-worn walls of masonry stone rise up to meet a grand roof that has long
since been claimed by the ravages of time.  Mossy pillars crumble, now
holding up nothing but stale air.  The stones at your feet are now
rubble-strewn, the debris and the wear of time obscuring the names of the
souls resting beneath the slabs set into the floor.  The large, empty
archway in which the temple door once stood leads to the graveyard to the
west.
