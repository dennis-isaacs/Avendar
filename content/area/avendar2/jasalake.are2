aloft by the soundless beating of a pair of bat-like wings that come from
its lower back and are perhaps the most clearly seen feature on its body. 
Its form is very thin and noticably female.  Thick, shoulder-length hair set
in tightly-curled ringlets sweeps back from a face veiled in shadow.

sockets, possessing an almost zealous intensity to them.  A thin-lipped,
small mouth beneath a twisted, scraggly beard.  Long, straight black hair
rolls back over his shoulders.  
In his right hand, he carries a long, shadowy whip.

#LORE Set to study in the Tower of Salyra at a young age, Rehaeda was very much
at the bottom of her class.  Unable to do much other than simple cures, she
became quite embarrassed when the pupils in her class surpassed her
knowledge of the healing arts quite handily.  One evening, she snuck out of
the Tower and fled from her studies.  Running toward the direction of her
home in Var Bandor, she realized that she would be shunned by her parents if
she were to return a failure.  Instead of returning to immediate defeat,
Rehaeda chose to enter the woods of Nendor.  Tired, hungry, and afraid, she
stumbled upon the guild of the Druids.  The guard took pity on her and
allowed her in, giving her a bed of leaves to rest in, and some herbal tea. 
The next morning when she awoke, Rehaeda found that she felt more alive than
ever in her bed of leaves, and pleaded with Inelion Lobern to allow her to
study under him.  

Months followed, and Rehaeda's innate knowledge of herbal lore became highly
evident.  Once she had been named a mistress of herbs, she returned to her
family, intent on telling them her good news.  Instead of rejoicing,
however, they sent her away, claiming that she was a disgrace to all they
had ever known.  She left the city in tears and followed the Aragol river to
its source, past her beloved forest of Nendor.  There, she came upon Jasa
Lake and the small Jaras community.  Realizing that many men had been burned
by the sun and were prone to being attacked by raids of angry srryn or the
fish known as the Jiast'ja, she took it upon herself to be the curatress of
the village.  She wove this cloak out of specially-found vines, and claimed
it to be her protection from the magics and harm of the land.  She wore
this, combined with a modified signet pendant she had found in Salyra as a
child, as the symbols of her past and future.

#LORE This pair of boots was said to have been carved by the hands of the Gods
themselves.  While this claim has for many many years remained
unsubstantiated, so they added to the small fame of the House of Aeisthis of
Gaald.  

Fateful was the day when Ilarilen Aeisthis, head of the House, handed these
boots to his eldest son as he headed to the School of Heroes.  The original
plan was that Ilresael, the son, were to enter the School, train his skill
in the high art of Swordmastery and to use his skills if the blade and the
political power of his father to overthrow Tanar, the Duke of Gaald, and
place the house of Aeisthis in power of the port town.  Sadly for Ilresael,
even the best-laid plans may have unforseen circumstances, which was what
befell him when he headed down the Aragol River to Jasa Lake to gloat his
superiority over the citizens of the village.  He wandered into the
village's house of Healing and began spewing spiteful phrases toward Rehaeda
and laughing at her lack of wealth.  Angered by the youth's insolence,
Rehaeda told him she would show him the greatest secret to her herbal arts,
and a way to increase his own wealth if he were to deal with it correctly. 


She lead him along the shore of the lake to a small pile of roots.  While
she knew what lay beneath, the youth was entirely oblivious, having spent
more of his study-time boasting about his family than learning the bestiary
of the world.  Rehaeda beckoned to Ilresael to take the roots, promising him
endless fortune if he were to take them.  As his hand clasped the roots, the
sjasis-beast leapt from the sand and began mauling the young adventurer with
its sharp teeth.  Rehaeda threw up a wall of thorns about the fighting pair,
keeping the youth from fleeing to safety.  After a few short moments,
Ilresael was dead, and Rehaeda and the sjasis stood above his corpse.  

With a wordless wave of her hand, Rehaeda offered the boots to the sjasis,
not knowing of their tale.  The beast greedily took the boots and wore them,
laughing shrilly in a mockery of the symbols which were inscribed thereupon.
After a short gloat, the beast lept upon the teen's corpse, rending flesh
from bone with alarming speed as Rehaeda returned to her home with a feeling
of accomplishment.  The House of Aeisthis remained uninformed on the issue
and assumed that their son had met some valiant end in slaying a dragon or
some equally foul beast.  Rehaeda all but forgot about the mouthy teen, whom
she deemed more worthy of death than the braggardlieness which he
exemplified so readily in her own home.  The sjasis kept the boots, enjoying
the way they felt on his feet, until he finally met his end.

#DESCRIPTION The thick leather of these boots has been carved with master precision. 
A depiction of a warring pair of dragons is on the left heel, while a
beautifully drawn holy symbol of Jolinn is on the right.  The figures of the
dragons, while still in the grain of the boot, appear to shift and battle as
you look at them, their tails winding about each other and reaching from the
heel to the toe.  The symbol of Jolinn mirrors only that which can be seen
in His shrine in Earendam.  While the symbol itself remains uncoloured, its
surface seems to shimmer with a bluish sheen as you examine it.  The soles
of the boot are made of similar leather and are polished to a mirror-like

Knights of Mett maintain their secrecy, lest their future
usefulness to the cause of Balance be reduced.  If it is necessary
for those of Idris to battle, all efforts should be made to secure
documents away safely prior to the fight.  Otherwise, much work may
be lost, or perhaps even captured and capitalized upon.  Clearly,
this is not a desirable outcome.

It is an honor to be a Knight of Enaerai.  To be among those
chosen to uphold the Balance that is so essential to these lands.

#DESCRIPTION {W***The Responsibility of the Knights of Idris***{x

Alas, despite the clear need for Balance, so many refuse to
accept it.  In most cases, this is not an active opposition to the
idea, rather, most prevalent is an apathy or lack of exposure to
it.  Therefore, the Knights of Enaerai seek to correct this.  There
are many differing methods for this, among them, simple teaching
and spreading of the ideas, to convince others of the need.
Failing this, some may be convinced to act as needed for the
Balance by making it not worth their while to refuse.  And
sometimes, though this need not be a last resort, direct violence
is required.  However the case may be, the overarching goal and
function of every Knight is to work towards maintaining the
balance.

The role the Idris branch plays in this is threefold.  Firstly,
it is the responsibility and function of Idris to consider,
develop, and spread the concept of Balance in all of its
manifestations.  This is done, of course, according to the
teachings of the Great Lady Enaerai, whom every Knight pledges to
serve at their induction.  Secondly, Knights of Idris should keep
information on adventurers, insofar as it pertains to their outlook
on life.  Ideally, this information is largely supplied by the Mett
branch.  The purpose of this is to provide an outlet for correcting
the balance when the Scales of Orlin lean overmuch.  The more that
is known, the more readily action may be taken.

This section continues on the fifth and final page.

#KEYWORDS  third
#DESCRIPTION There are those who, possessed of a more altruistic outlook,
cannot conceive of the need for Balance because it permits, even 
requires, darkness and evil.  This idea is intrinsically flawed.
Consider a world where there was no such thing as 'poor'.  Every
inhabitant of this world must have the same number and quality of
possession as every other.  If this were not true, there would be
some sort of difference of degree in wealth, and whichever had less
would be deemed 'poor', even if they were by our standards 
fabulously wealthy.  This is true because titles like 'rich' and 
'poor' are utterly relative to one another.  Yet, even if the case
where each denizen had the exact same as every other were true, 
none of them could be called 'rich'  Not poor, but not rich either.
In the same way, 'good' and 'evil' are relative descriptors.  If 
there was no darkness, no evil, in the lands, then there could be 
no good, nor any light.  And how can someone who claims to seek
good actively choose a world in which there was no good or light?
And so their argument fails.

With just what has so far been presented, one might perceive
Balance as a necessary burden to carry, a chore that must be
performed.  In truth, it is a glorious thing, a gift granted to us
all, not a punishment.  But, one might argue, Balance dictates that
if you experience joy and pleasure, you must also at some point
experience pain.  How can that be a gift?


He who seeks an understanding of such an apparent paradox should
refrain from taking food or drink of any kind for an extended
period of time, until his mouth is parched and his stomache has
long since ceased rumbling from hunger.  After the time has passed,
he should partake of a simple meal, perhaps some Nendorian cakes
and water.  Provided the length of his fast was ample, the joy he 
feels, and the pleasure of relief in such a meagre banquet, is far
greater than he would have felt with a sumptuous array had he not
abstained.  The point of this is to understand the function of pain
and sacrifice - these things enhance the experiences of joy and
pleasure.  They bring focus into our lives.  And then a
comprehension of the gift of Balance is easy to grasp.  Balance is
that which takes our joys and makes them truly joyful, and our
pains and makes them truly painful.  In truth, it is that which
expands the sensation of life itself, for no life is without any
joy or any pain.  And in that, Balance is a great gift to us all.

#DESCRIPTION {W***The Necessity of Balance***{x

Having defined what is actually meant by Balance, the natural
question that arises is "Why should this Balance be upheld?".  At 
the simplest level, the answer to this is that it is the natural 
way.  Evidence of this can be found all throughout nature - in the
daily interchange of sun and moons, in the lives and deaths of all
living creatures, in the cycle of seasons.  Even in the fascinating 
interplay of water and fire - the former will quench the latter,
but in the process neutralize itself into vapor - can this concept
of balance be found.  The original Three of the Pantheon, with or
without realizing it, created the world this way.

And example may be taken from those very Three.  One of the
light, one of the darkness, one of neither persuasion: in all, 
perfect balance.  At first glance, this may seem defeated by the
fact that each followed an orderly way.  But a slightly deeper 
understanding of the matter reveals that this is necessary, for 
balance to be acheived.  After all, before the form and order they
created, there was only chaos.  Their very lawfulness balanced this
disarray, and neatly completes the example.

Many reject the necessity of Balance, choosing instead to seek
personal gain. This reveals, however, the narrowness of their
scope.  For to defy the natural way is to place oneself at risk.
If excessive, nature itself will rebuke the imbalance.  This very
instance was exemplified in the raising up of the Goddess Girikha,
to offset the rigid control of the law.  Thus, ignoring or
attempting to overpower Balance for personal gain is an act doomed
to fail, unless somehow that force is stronger than nature itself
(and by extension, the might of all Three combined).

#DESCRIPTION {W***The Essence of Balance***{x

The term 'Balance', particularly as it relates to the Knights of Enaerai,
has been at times misunderstood.  One of the most common misconceptions of
this ideal semms to be the thought that there can nothing extreme in one's
life.  That somehow, all colors must be grey, all actions minimal and
mundane, all food bland, all excitement contained.  But such a lifestyle
would be unnecessarily unfulfilling.  No, the key to understanding what is
truly meant by Balance is to realize that for any phenomena, there is, or
should be, a counter-phenomena.  That is, if one side of the spectrum of
etremities is experienced, so should the other, in its turn.  Practically
speaking, this translates into the coexistance of, for example, good and
evil.  Or perhaps order and disorder.  

To understand this further, consider the analogue of a board of wood evenly
levelled atop a small rock.  When there is naught upon the board, it is
balanced.  However, it serves no purpose.  This is analogous to the world
ere it was populated with life - balanced, yet unfulfilled.  If an object of
uniform shape and weight is placed in the exact center of the board, the
setup will remain balanced.  For the sake of the analogy, assume that no
further objects can be placed atop this one, that is, that none of these are
stackable.  In that case, the board is level (and therefore acceptable), but
the system still has not achieved its full potential, as there remains a
great length of unladen board.  This is similar to the lifestyle described
in the beginning, that of blandness and relative inaction.  Indeed, it can
even be easily argued that such a way of life is inherently unbalanced in
and of itself, but that is not the point of this present explanation.  The
board has not reached its full potential until its entire length is covered,
in the middle and at both extremes.  And behold, that though there exist
objects at the extremities of the board - analogously, at the extremities of
life - the board remains level and balanced.  That is what is meant by
'Balance': not the absence of extremes, but rather their equilibrium.

deep, royal blue, surrounded by a plaid pattern of bright red, forest green,
ochre, and hints of black.  Extra yarns, added later, it seems, compliment
and elaborate the original pattern, almost as if telling a story in some
primitive, tribal manner.  Overall, the bright, garish threads,
dichotomously discordant yet complimentary, blend well with each other, the
weave strong and symbolic.  A brighter slash of ochre, almost a yellow,
zigzags crazily down the length of the central blue stripe.  Three heavy bone
pins, slightly curved, are pushed through the coarse weave.  Bloodstained,
they each bear a burnt-in 'X' on the wider end.

a pillar similar to this one rises from the deeper waters.

many of the weeds are crested with deep purple flowers.  A small path
follows the southern wall of the hut to the north, while the weeds and grass
continue to the north and east.  To the south, the ground sinks nearly a
foot downward and reeds take hold.

A full grown marsh is to the west, behind the northern hut.  Southward, a

half, save a few tall rocks which have sunk most of the way into the mire. 
The building to the west appears to be quite stable, supported by two tall
wooden poles which disappear into the muck.  The reeds and plants become
impassable to the south, yet Mount Enrien is visible in the distance above them.

#NAME In a Large House
#DESCRIPTION This cramped and squalid room has the appearance of a well used home.  A
single large cot sits in the northwestern corner, its cover ripped in many
places to expose the hay within.  Across from the cot, a window has been cut
in the wall and its expanse has been covered with a stained and ratted
gauze.  A small, poorly made cabinet hangs along the eastern wall, its
locking mechanism broken off.  The mildewed walls on which the cabinet hangs
give the room a claustrophobic feeling, and the only exits are the
rectangular holes to the east and south.

cavern, light splotches of green dancing across their surface.

#NAME A Large Underwater Cavern
#DESCRIPTION A large cave opens here, decorated with the remains of many beings in
varying states of decay.  The walls of the cave itself are relatively clean,
yet mere inches above its floor float a number of fish parts, bodiless tails
eerily still in the murky water of the cavern.  A pile of bones sits in the
northeast corner, partially covered by a thin layer of gently-swaying algae.
