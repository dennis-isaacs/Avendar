#DESCRIPTION An old, scarred veteran of many battles, this kankoran stands proudly,
ignoring the chill of age in his bones.  The fur that lies visible between
layers of warm pelts is criss-crossed with ugly scar tissue, in patterns
suggesting a ritual application, rather than battle-wounds.  Despite the
expression of languid determination on the old kankoran's face, the
impression received is more one of weariness, as if his time has been done.

biting cold at bay, despite the thick brown fur sported by most of them. 
Unusually, the kankoran's head is kept clear of adornment, exposed to the
cold, perhaps with the exception of a stone earring or feathered browband. 
A leather harness is sported to carry the implements most useful to the
kankoran's daily life, which make dull chiming sounds as they collide in
strong winds.

i am the bare bones of the earth defiled and nude
  
ripped asunder to reveal stony horrors deep below
  
i am the ash which chokes when all fires lie dead
  
then bright light of the northeast shall wink out
  
for a false illusion it will spend itself utterly
  
bloody the talon which wrings life from the young
  
wholly mine is given the deathless sleeps of ages
  
mine is the power that does not fade into nothing
  
i am the chill wave spawned by a dead stale ocean
  
which does tear and strain upon sterile shoreline
  
the ki'yadi shall take up my name born to descend
  
on wings of night will his voice command the mass
  
i own the husk of a broken world laid open to die
  
beneath my feet the land cries out helpless alone

#DESCRIPTION Jutting out into the dark northern sea, the slightly crooked rocky spit
seems to point accusingly at the ice floes.  The footing here is a little
unsure, the snow being blown clear by desiccating winds wailing from the
floes, exposing rocks all too willing to move of their own accord.  All
around spreads the northern sea, visible between islands of ice, which
themselves contrast strongly, their vibrant blue and white bands at odds
with the black waters.  Far to the north, above the horizon, strange colours
dance in the sky.  Small waves lap at the foot of the spit, barely audible
over the strong winds.  A small rocky trail leads back to the plains.

#NAME Hill Overlooking the Hyloth
#DESCRIPTION Standing on the snow-laden peak of a hill, the powerful Hyloth can be
seen skirting by the lower slopes to the west, its frigid waters feeding the
ice sea.  The south-eastern slopes flatten out, becoming a broad, white
plain stretching to the horizon.  A wide red rock, not matching any in the
vicinity, has been hauled to the peak of the hill, and has had its top
flattened out and polished, allowing remarkable green veins to show through.
The wind is bitingly cold here, exposed on the hill-top, with nothing to
interrupt its flow.

of considerable significance to the kankoran.

a small hill, covered in an endless blanket of white.

one side, and the mighty ridge face on the other.  Glistening in the light,
freezing cold water spews over rough rocks, frothing further into the
rapids.  Sounds of angry water permeate the air, unusually loud in these
desolate plains.

#DESCRIPTION The Hyloth river slows down here, taking advantage of a natural basin in

point, the neck of the basin seems shallow enough to cross on foot, the
frigid waters rippling slightly with the wind.  Patchy snow lines the banks
here, and small spiky reeds try to survive in the slower waters near the
bank.  The ford connects the wide eastern plains to a thin embankment to the

#NAME A Split in the River
#DESCRIPTION Flowing ever northward, the Hyloth takes pause here to pass around a
small island, slightly off-centre from the flow.  The banks of the island
are steep and lined with cold uninviting mud held in place by the roots of
mature green trees.  Curiously, there no snow is evident on the island.  To
the east, mighty wide plains spread out, covered in patchy snow, while the
western bank is steep, leading rapidly to a looming ridge.  A slick rocky
bank blocks passage to the west, but wide snowy plains open out to the east.

#NAME A Green Island
#DESCRIPTION Shortly up from the banks, a soft green grass takes hold, spreading over
the centre of the island, and an unusually soft breeze caresses the blades,
making them dance in strange lines.  Mature trees, their leaves a vibrant
emerald, line the banks of the island to form a lax ring, enough to protect
the island from outside prying eyes.  Very little snow is apparent, mostly
confined to deep, dark places such as between roots.  Small deep blue
flowers, their centres a strong gold colour, are sprinkled just inside the
ring of trees.  In the centre of the grass a shaped stone tableau glows a
soft green.

#DESCRIPTION Slightly warm to touch, this odd piece of stone is roughly waist-high,
and as wide as a human is tall.  The top of the stone has been shorn clean
off, and polished to a mirror finish, with not so much as a scratch marring
the surface.  Green bands of malachite form organic shapes in the surface,
almost seeming to change as you watch.  In contrast, the five rough sides of
the tableaux are intricately carved, appearing as though tree-roots hold the
surface of the tableaux stable.  The carving seems to follow the line of the
malachite - more prominent roots follow the lighter bands, with the darker
bands forming the dark recesses.

the river also lessen, from the angry sounds of water churning past jutting
rocks, to the quiet rippling sounds of a river at peace.  To the south,
steep hills rise, forming the foothills of the Brintors, and the west bank
is shallow enough to climb.

cover close to a half of the water's surface.  Grey fish dart about the
reeds, feeding on an ice-blue algae that grows nestled between the stalks. 
The banks here are gentle, showing little signs of snow, and small green
shrubs grow close to the pools edge.  A little to the south of here, the
mighty Brintors rise up, forbidding in their size.

#DESCRIPTION Rolling snow-covered plains butt up against the wild Hyloth rapids, a
border of snowy rock keeping the two separate.  A part of the plains begins
to descend, funnelling towards a slow point in the rapids, where it appears
possible to cross on foot.  The whistling wind intermingles with the sound
of the rapids, seemingly all that can be heard in this bleak land.  Wide
white plains stretch out away from the river.

#NAME Near the Jyarks
#DESCRIPTION A sizeable embankment marks the edge of the the Jyark Mountains,
spreading as far as can be seen to the north and south.  Patchy snow
decorates the icy earth here, making progress on foot a little tricky, as
loose rocks from the embankment litter the ground, hidden by the snow.  A
dark hole gapes from the embankment, almost at tall as an Alatharya, from
which an unusual high-pitched squealing noise emanates.  A spur of the
mountains juts into the plains to the north, dominated by a single peak, its
apex concealed by clouds.

intricately carved with numerous sigils, which become fainter as they near
the tip of the rock.  The surrounding snow has been carefully swept away,
and small effigies of Kankoran line the base of the stone.  Before the
outcropping lies a hide-covered pit, and a hide pavilion stands nearby.

#DESCRIPTION A large ovoid shape, the outcropping looms here, to the point of

most of its length, carved into the stone, each filled with a reddish wax. 
As you draw your sight down the side, you notice that the further from the
tip, the deeper and more recent the carvings.  With only the wind and snow
to erode this rock, truly it must be ancient.

#NAME A Black Monolith
#DESCRIPTION The gentle rolling plains lie pierced here by a great black needle,
punching through the surface of the earth and high into the sky.  Snow lies
embanked around its base, collected there by the wind, and not a single
plant can be seen within a hundred paces.  An uneasy sentiment exudes from
the monolith, making all those near uncomfortable.  Frozen, patchy plains
stretch out in all directions, and the wind seems a little duller here than
nearby.

#DESCRIPTION The monolith seems beyond black, it is difficult to see more than one
shade of it, seeming almost as if you are staring at a flat rent in the
fabric of the world.  Defining its nature, though, myriad upon myriad of
intricate runes line the surface, the edges of the larger ones picked out by
snow settling in the carvings.  Just at the side of your sight, the runes
seem to twist and change, but as you focus upon them, they appear no
different to the last you looked.

#NAME Top of a Black Monolith
#DESCRIPTION The end of the monolithic needle comes sharply, the slim, steep sides
suddenly tapering in to a vicious, sharp point, kept well clear of snow,
despite the complete lack of air movement here.  A very uneasy feeling
spreads from the point of the monolith, almost overpowering you, and the air
almost drips with power.  The sheer blackness of the monolith stands in
bright contrast to the snowy white plains below.  An unparalleled viewing
point, you can see lie the Karacha woods in the distance to the south-west,
the Jyarks rise from the plains to the east, and far to the south, the
mighty Brintors dominate the lands.

the runes themselves would reject anything that dares to fill them.

#NAME Edge of the Karacha Woods
#DESCRIPTION Butted up against the looming foothills of the Brintors, the firs here
have a somewhat easier task of staying protected from the inclement weather.
The thick undergrowth flourishing under the protective firs is quite a bit
thicker here, and catches at your accoutrements, making passage a little
more difficult.  More parasitic vines are evident in the southern part of
the Karacha, wrapping the firs in their slow, loving embrace.  A small gully
opens the foothills to the south, too rocky to hold much greenery.

comparison to the mighty specimens to the north, limited in their available
light and soil.  Little in the way of other growth is evident here, the firs
becoming more and more sparse as the canyon nears its end, snow filling the
gaps between the trees quite effectively.

steep enough to slough off any snow into a deep bank at their feet.

#NAME The Bandit's Lair
#DESCRIPTION Once picked for its proximity to the old Shendaer road, this cave has
seen many generations of bandits.  Now, with the decline of Shendaer, the
bandits must travel further for lesser reward.  The smell of roasted meat
permeates the air, which is warm from a fire banked near the centre of the
cave.  Light tendrils of smoke stains the ceiling, building up a greasy
blanket, before working its way to the mouth of the cave, and swirls gently
outwards.  Around the fire, odd cooking items lie in a haphazard fashion,
and several piles of uncured hides lay about, assumedly for bedding.  Deeper
into the cave, a small ice-cold pool rests, less than a foot across, but
constantly fed by trickles of water running down the slimy green rock above
it.

#DESCRIPTION A gentle rise lies tightly enclosed by rocky walls on either side,
looming high enough to block the weak sun for most of the day.  Despite
this, the thin layer of snow lies worn and used, as though many creatures
travel this way.  A stiff breeze blows intermittently between the walls,
chilling yet bracing.  The divide curves slowly around to the south, yet the

worn in the centre, lies along the southern wall, looking to make a very

destination.  The waters themselves present a vibrant deep sapphire blue, a
strong colour bizarre in this pale land.  The gorge walls lining the stony
beach are high, yet shallow, allowing long daylight hours, and the steam
thickens the lean air, making it far more breathable, even relaxing.  Across

incredible, although the steam lizards seem to revel in it.  Small glittery
stones collected by the lizards lie strewn about the rough base of the
chamber, reflecting light oddly in the superheated water, and no algae grows
here, the heat being too great, leaving the chamber walls rough and sharp.

#DESCRIPTION The ravine to the north lies pinched off here, its apex nestling in the
hold of the Brintor mountains.  A smoothed path, wide enough for two carts
aside, wends its way along the floor of the ravine, and rises with the floor
to the apex, where it turns west through a cutting.  Though the air is
chill, there is little movement, and no sound, bar only that you bring with
you.

#DESCRIPTION Sparse knee-high scrub grasses fight with patchy snow for dominance of
the plains.  Where one falters, the other takes over.  The result is a stark
dark-green and grubby-white contrast, spreading across the slightly soft
earth.  Incessant winds churn the sharp-edged grasses, constantly testing
their thick stalks for strength.  

Within the grass, a half-circle of tall stone pillars stands.  The bases of
each appear to be made of a very old, weather worn rock, while their
intricately decorated columns appear to be relatively new.  Five statues of
animals are situated between each of the pillars, each one posed as if in
action.  At the center of the half-circle is a single ancient pillar, whose
shaft is decorated with primitively-drawn scenes of the ancient plains. 
Directly before the ancient pillar is a similarly ancient statue of a
snarling wolf.

#NAME The Fir
#DESCRIPTION Interrupting the low scrub and occasional desiccated trees that cover the
plains here, a lone fir tree towers, mighty enough to be seen for miles
around, growing vigorously despite the poor soil.  The branches sweep wide,
even touch the ground at the edges, and spread out far enough at the base
that a herd of caribou could be kept within, with room to spare for the
herder and family.  Sloughed snow creates a small wall encircling the tree,
and an arch of branches creates an opening within the canopy, which is
sealed with a hide door.  A circular red rock sits before the Fir, with
rough-hewn sides and a glass-smooth upper surface.  A small, quiet pool lies
to the south-west, filled with reeds, and the mighty Brintor range envelop
the southern horizon.  Elsewhere, scrubby plains stretch out from the Fir.

the peak.  Just underneath it are set four runes, one pointing in each of
the cardinal directions, which represent earth, air, fire, and water.  Along

#NAME Under the Peak of Mount Khorak
#DESCRIPTION The thin dry air here makes breathing unusually difficult, but does
nothing to quell the astonishing view south over the Brintors.  Blues and
whites spread out before you, and you can see the major paths of the
Brintors as tiny ribbons.  To the south of the peak lies a stockaded
village, the inhabitants large enough to pick out individually, even at this
range.  In the far distance, the Arien Plains appear as a wide smear across
the horizon.  Above you, to the north, the peak of Mount Khorak rises, laden
heavily with snow, like the path you now walk.  The air seems very still,
and unnaturally quiet.

ill-maintained.  Covered with a patina of snow and ice that contrast its
dark stone, the bridge seems sturdy enough despite the gaping holes where
stone has fallen through into the icy Hyloth beneath.  Spreading out to
either side, the trail for which this bridge was built lies equally
unwanted, and the Hyloth snakes northwards to meet a great ridge rising in
that direction.  To the south, the source of the Hyloth seems to source from
within the Brintors, which swallow the entire southern horizon.

South of here, the land grows marshy and soft, under the patchy snow, and

#DESCRIPTION Here, a trail comes to an intersection, if such can be called that, and a
large marker stone lies at the crossroad.  A well-maintained trail connects
the southern path, running along the base of the western foothills, to a
steep western path rising into the same.  The eastern path, much disused and
not maintained, heads towards an old bridge, just visible in the distance. 
North of here, patchy snow appears to gain a stronger grip on the land, and
before long, a great ridge rises taking up much of the northern horizon.

river.  Tufts of wiry grasses settle in the windless areas around the rocks,
safe from passing feet.

grey stone walls.  Beyond the gatehouse, the great Dome of the Morning Sun
can be seen, burnished in gold, almost painful to look at when the sun is
shining clearly.  Before the gatehouse, a small break in the pass offers a
view across the plains, and is lined with a low redbrick wall to keep
travellers safe.

#NAME A Well-used Trail
#DESCRIPTION A trail lies etched into the lightly-snowed plains, companioned by a
series of markers.  More well-maintained than well-used, the trail seems to
see more foot and pack-animal traffic than wheeled.  Each marker is clearly
enscripted, and some show signs of renewal from weathering.  To the south,
the trail disappears into a pass within the Brintors, and smoke rises from a
guardhouse just within the pass.  The trail then runs north, into the cold,
windy plains.

competitors may take their place, and the skeletons of small animals lie at
their bases, their ribs crunching dryly underfoot.  Slowly, the scrubland
becomes more dense to the west, where twisted, pained oaks bend in shapes
uneasy to the eye.  The great ridge turns north to follow the line of the
scrublands for a short way, before turning west again.  A small animal trail
lead up through the scrub, to near the top of the ridge.

#NAME Centre of the High Plateau
#DESCRIPTION Angry winds curl overhead, intent on driving all before them, sending
tendrils of gusts down to the surface of the plateau.  This area seems a
little lower than the surrounding plateau, and it seems that the central
part has been cleared of boulders, leaving a smooth area devoid of obstacle.
In the middle of this clear part lies a red teardrop-shaped stone, no bigger
than a human, set point-upward in its rest.  

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  stone teardrop
#DESCRIPTION Made of some crimson stone, this teardrop has undoubtedly been brought
from afar, matching no stone in the vicinity.  Roughly carved through being
chipped with hard stone, the stone assumes a flat teardrop shape, and sports
a thick edge running north-south, with the flow of the wind.

#NAME Above the Cove
#DESCRIPTION The great ridge begins to thin as it moves northward, as a cove of dark
water pushes its west side closer to the eastern cliffs.  The ridge becomes
a little less broken as it thins, and more openly exposed.  Biting winds
flurry up from the cove, almost completely overpowered by the roaring
northern winds, howling up over the not too distant northern cliffs, and the
constant change of direction makes it hard to stay stable.

Starting from a solid base extending out past the ridge, the tower's
ice-blue stone walls swoop up, narrowing to about half the base width before
flaring out again.  The base seems set onto stone buttresses, though it is
unimaginable that masons would come here to perform such work.  All of the
few windows appear dark, but for a moderate-sized one about halfway up,
which seems to emit a welcomingly warm light.  A small arched door at the
base lies partly open, seemingly jammed against some internal tile.

hooks, and are so faded that it is only possible to tell their predominant
colours: blue.  Small furniture lies in ruins, organic parts long since
rotted, and metal parts falling in a heap around them.  A spiral staircase,
perhaps wide enough for a human and a half, curls anti-clockwise up the
tower, starting from due east.  Under the stairs to the north, a banded oak
door still sits in place, and a similar door lies to the west, partly
covered with ruins of furniture.  Further under the stairs, a trapdoor sits
with a heavy beam of wood lying across it.  In the dead centre of the tower
lies a mosaic of an iceburst, and looking up from there, you can see the

#DESCRIPTION The deep oubliette lies directly beneath the trapdoor, the black metal
walls glistening with faintly glowing glyphs, providing an even, unsettling
glow.  Upwards, the smooth walls slowly grow towards the trapdoor, smooth
and offering no purchase.  Indeed, as you place your hand close to the wall,
you notice that it stops half al inch short of it.  Somehow, this metal
canister feels cut-off from the surrounding world.  

Mad, disjointed etchings are somehow carved in the black metal of the wall.

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  etchings mad disjointed carved
#DESCRIPTION The etchings have neither rhyme nor reason to their distribution, being
in the main and incomprehensible cloud of phrases, glyphs, and individual
symbols.  Concentrated analysis of the writings reveals scattered pieces of
words in various mortal languages, but no sign of rational pattern.  

This particular instance of the etching seems particularly vivid, and is
actually carved into the wall of the oubliette.  If you wished to learn more
of it, you might do well to study it.

#KEYWORDS  symbolvision
#DESCRIPTION You stare at the etchings, soaking in the full extent of their sprawl.  

Long minutes pass, and just as you are about to give up in frustration, an
insight strikes you.  

Feverishly, you follow the pattern of the glyphs and symbols in the piece,
unable to look away.  You grasp for enlightenment, and the oubliette fades
from sight......  



An unending waste spreads in all directions, a gray desolation devoid of any
color or hope.  Long lines of mortal beings -- humans, ethron, and aelin,
all kneel on the ground.  Each of them is engaged in a fervent chant, and
each of them scrawls the same unending, mad etchings in the soil.  

Horrified, you realized that the eyes of these beings have been scooped out,
revealing gaping sockets.  Their fingers are little more than grisly nubs,
locked in the never ending pattern of their devotion.  

Strangely compelled, you kneel yourself, and begin scrabbling the symbols in
the sand.  Somehow, you know, this will bring you enlightenment.  Somehow,
you will be the one devoted enough to perfect the pattern.  Resolute, you
begin again, your hands following the same lines, over and over....  

Your vision clears, and the Mad Etchings have burned their pattern into your
mind.

#NAME Disused Kitchen
#DESCRIPTION This kitchen curves to fit the form of the tower, making unnecessary work
for any cook to use it.  Stout oaken tables have stood the test of time,
their surfaces scored from many decades of use.  A hearth lies to one side,
a magical flame burning evenly at its base, the blackened cauldron that once
hung over it now lying deformed at its base.  Tarnished kitchenware hangs
all over the inner walls, and along the outer wall a series of three windows
show stark views of the outside environs, and seem to be made of something
far stronger than glass.

#DESCRIPTION Curving to fit the turn of the tower, this room seems perhaps a little
larger than normal for an apprentice, yet it is unmistakably so from the
nave decorations adorning the room, now tired with age.  A narrow bed, its
mattress mouldered, sits hard up against one wall, and next to it looks an
unused writing-desk.  Opposite, a bookcase half-full of mouldered books
sits, small piles of old green paint lying at its foot.  A series of three
windows gives a strong view over the northern sea, cold and forbidding.  The
room is quite chilly, and a waist-high brazier sits ready to receive fuel to
burn for warmth.

oak, sits out from one wall, its blue silken canopy partially fallen from
its supports.  Washing stands, dressing table, garderobe and the like are
all well-built, but more to pragmatics than beauty.  A long wide window,
rotten drapes pulled aside, gives an excellent view over the dark northern
sea, replete with ice floes.  A small magical fire burns in a grating,
removing the edge of cold from the room, but not quite warming it in the
process.

the room thanks to a blazing fire burning magically in the firegrate, and
swirled magically with tiny eddies of air, focussed to be barely noticeable.
The room takes up the half of the tower opposite the Master's bedroom, and
is tastefully appointed in darkened oak and deep maroon leather, a little
aged, but still in good condition.  Small magical knick-knacks line shelves
and walls, prominent amongst them is a sturdy silver-bound chest lying near
the firegrate.  A lavishly appointed desk sits against the wall opposite to
the fire, sporting a leather writing surface and a dedicated lamp to light
it.

Great piles of ruined vials, metals, and rotted cloth sack adorn the room,
interspersed with similarly degraded crates.  A small firegrate to one side
seems to have been home to an explosion, looking unevenly carved and black
scorching surrounds it to a distance of two feet.  No fire burns there now.

obscene, sweeping out over the wide white sheet that is the great northern
plains.  At this distance, even the mighty Hyloth river seems little more
than a weak ribbon.  The room itself lies filled with detritus, a curved
bench running the entire length of the window, covered with broken and
decayed alchemical apparatus, reagents, decayed grimoires and magical
mechanical contraptions.  A thin brass handrail surrounds on three sides a
trapdoor which leads down .  The room itself is lighted in the main by four

#NAME The Anraynirs' Tower
#DESCRIPTION The tower, tiled in warm roseate marble, is but a single tall chamber. 
The ceiling is an airy dome of weathered green copper which is supported by
slender columns.  Stately clerestory windows between the columns admit a
wealth of light during daytime.  Set into the floor in the center of the
ring of columns is a wide pool.  Outside the ring of columns, basketed
plants, bookcases, and framed paintings establish a warm and comfortable
atmosphere.  A wooden staircase which begins along the western side of the
tower spirals upward, leading to lofts which form the main living and
working areas of the tower.  Set into the stone of the eastern wall is a

dry to the touch, the paper is infused with obviously magical watercolors. 
A flickeringly unstable abstract, the paint is arrayed in a pale wash of
blending colors, lines of blurred hues stretching along the length of the
paper.  

The paint wavers and shifts under your gaze, ephemeral images blinking in
and out of view.  Of the confused jumble, you are only able to make out a
few:

Several golden and chestnut smiles fade in and out of view.  A hand,
reaching.  A couple embracing.  A sudden flash of spiritlight.  A gentle
fountain.  A golden, sun-dappled grove.  A gently-moving brush.  

After several long moments, the succession of images becomes too much.  

A small phrase is printed on one end: "Spirit Bond - by Pikkli".

#KEYWORDS  fourthpainting
#DESCRIPTION A heavy rectangle of card three feet by four is here, covered with a
garishly vivid watercolor.  The scene is at first a swirling miasma of red,
and nothing more.  Yet, after a moment's scrutiny...  

 ... The paint ripples twice, and the vermillion fades somewhat to reveal a
ghastly scene.  A dual wash of watercolor paint has been applied to the
card, the first coat seemingly allowed to settle to its dry-but-not-dry
state of enchanted stability before applying the second.  The two
superimposed images portray two differing scenes, yet, after a moment's
confusion, a third overlay becomes evident.  

The first layer, though difficult to discern exact details, portrays a lush
garden.  A set of golden gates cordon off the fertile area, and a proud
sentinel hovers outside them.  Tall rows of fruit trees bear fragrant, heavy
blossoms.  

The second layer shows a white marble temple, floating ethereally among
vaporous clouds.  A beautifully carved altar stands before a breathtakingly
magnificent pegasus.  Tall columns reach into nothingness.  

The third, more subtle overlay is vague, and difficult to isolate from the
others.  Suddenly, your eye catches a hold of the outlines, and you realize
that the third overlay is the reddish haze which partially obscures the
other two, swirling dully like a heavy fog.  

As the subtleties of the third layer continue to gently shift across your
vision, your eye loses the focus, and returns to the other two layers. 
Somehow, the scenes have changed - at first, the differences are
imperceptible, but slowly the changes become apparent.  

In the first garden scene, the trees are bare.  Shrivelled and withered, the
orchard has been laid barren by something worse than any winter.  Clumps and
random pieces of carrion are scattered carelessly among the neat paths, and
the golden gates are tarnished and cast down.  Of the silver figure, nothing
is to be seen.

The crimson fog swirls lazily, and your gaze shifts again to the second
layer.  

Here, the columns are defiled, smeared with gore and written upon with crude
symbols scribed in blood.  The altar is a smoking ruin, shards of marble
scattered wantonly about.  The pegasus leans crazily on one side, headless
and broken.  Chips of the once-magnificent beast are strewn about, and the
clouds themselves seem to have taken on a reddish hue.  As your eye picks
out the hurts done in each scene, one by one, it becomes evident that care
has been taken to overlap the injuries.  The defilements are identical from
one to the next, shifting slightly to match the scene along with your gaze. 

Finally, the scarlet miasma thickens again, as if in triumph.  The paint
about the edges of the card shifts, wavers, and then seems to ripple down
ward, making the enchanted scene before seem as if seen through blurry,
tear-filled eyes.  

A soft pinprick of gentle green-gold light suddenly stabs through the haze. 
Contrasting dramatically, the tiny dewdrop of light shimmers, then forms
into a tiny sapling, bearing only three minute leaves.  The gentle light
seems to force back the reddish barrier as surely as sun burning through
cold fog, until the miniscule sprout has established itself, clear and
crisply detailed.  The sharpness of the shoot catches and holds the eye,
drawing it away from the vague, now-faded horrors behind.  

Two small inked words read at the bottom: 'Atcea - Hope'.  

A tiny inked signature can be seen in a lower corner: 'Pikkli'.

background is a uniform charcoal grey.  

A large, simple form is made from soft lines of creamy oil paint.  The
curving lines form the simple face of a woman, image captured in one moment
of time.  The woman's neck and hair are indistinct, and nothing more has
been painted.  All attention focuses on her face and one hand, poised in
front of her.  

The woman's eyes are half-closed, mouth set in a powerful 'O' as she sings. 
Her expression speaks of a soulful feeling, of personal, raw emotion in her
song.  The hand she lifts before her is slightly cupped, almost caressing
her music as it pours from her.  

A small, smudgy word has been painted at the bottom: 'Alyxxa'.  

A tiny signature is scratched in the lower right corner: 'Pikkli'.

A young but valiant soldier, sword in hand,
Strides forth to purge the giants from the land.
  
He sees a hulking brute across a gulf,
With club in hand, and followed by a wolf.
The soldier leaps the chasm in one bound,
The giant turns and roars, a dreadful sound.
  
The battle joins with awful howl and yell,
But then the giant cries and breaks the spell!
 "You hit me on the hand!"
 "Did not!"
 "Did so!"
 "Don't you tell ma!"
 "I will, and off I go!"
  
And to the keep he runs, tears in his eyes,
His pup in tow, and barking in surprise
To go back home so early in the day--
His master rarely quits so soon at play.
  
In children's games we see an echoed life,
A world of pain and fear, a world of strife.
We too seek love and safety's warm embrace,
A yearning all our years cannot replace.

Two hearts warmed by Aeoliss decree--
Within the waters flow life comes to light.

The spirits subtle glow quickens our sight.
  
When we embrace our living with delight,
Which gift, by word of Jolinn came to be--
Within the waters flow life comes to light.
   
When blinding chains of violence and spite
Ensnare us, with Alajial lies the key--
The spirits subtle glow quickens our sight.
  
When shrouds of woe are woven far too tight
And stony hearts lie black beneath the sea--

#DESCRIPTION To wait and to anticipate your love
After long months or seeming years had passed
Was bitter sweetness, like a mystic trove
Where dazzling, ward-enchanted gems are massed.
I could not touch your hand but in my dream,
Nor see your gentle smile but in my mind,
The ache of missing you a constant theme
Despite the signs that showed our fates aligned.
Together through a spirit-bond of hope
Though distances and sunsets do us part,
The simple magics of the heart are rope
That bind us more than any mystic's art.
  I cannot touch my dreams unless with you,
  And so my heart and hopes will remain true.

#DESCRIPTION Eril Dawn
Humble cottages nestle
At the feet of tall trunks,
Cluster below sheltering boughs.  
The Nendor straddles the hamlet,
A mighty, green pavilion.
Its ivy-shod deep-rooted guards
Beat back the heat of summer
And, at a year's end, filter
White-laced winds.
  
An enchantment of a sort
Rests lightly on that place.
All about, its hazy shimmer
Can be seen by those 
Who'd care enough to see.
Like the glimmer-air
Above a warm day's fire,
It spells woodland peace
And a subtle sylvan grace
All along clean-swept paths
And among the mossy cottages.
  
At the Belliful, on a balcony,
Two youths stand close,
Gazing over the thatched roofs,
Gazing eastward toward the spot
The sun first crests the treeline.
Ch'taren and Caladaran, they watch
For a future both long to meet.
Their first soft touch, 
The blushing kiss mean more
Than words mean from the wisest sage,
Mean more than even hesistant love
Professed in halting smiles,
Though no more earnest,
No more certain.
  
Light like a dew-bath drips down
Through a veil of leaves.
Villagers make morning greetings,
Voices in the marketplace call
Over birdsong and a fountain's burble.
Daybreak and love sweep 
Over the stirring village,
And the enchantment of Eril
Glimmers anew, rustles in the leaves,
Rests easy in the air.

#DESCRIPTION A large rectangle of heavy card is here, framed with black matting.  The
bright, enchanted watercolor glistens and moves as though wet, yet is dry to
the touch.  A pleasantly rural scene is here, a wood-shingled village framed
by hale trees.  Vivid green moss, almost glowing in its vitality, clings to
the roofs of the small hamlet.  A branch or two obscures some small parts of
the left and right foregrounds, giving the general impression of having been
painted from among the branches of a tree.  

The magically sealed paint moves occasionally, as the branches sway in an
unfelt breeze.  Below, in the cleanly-swept paths, happy citizens can be
seen, painted in bright, happy colors with great detail.  In the left
midground, a two-story building stands, painted in slightly greater focus
than the rest of the work.  As your eye sweeps over it, the paint seems to
almost billow a moment, allowing you to see the balconied second floor in
even greater detail.  Leaning on the balcony, wrapped in a tender embrace,
are a pair of figures.  One, shorter and chubbier with long black hair, has
golden skin which seems to sparkle at random moments.  The other, painted
with strong, sweeping brushstrokes of painstaking care is tall and slender,
sporting a regal beard and warm, brown skin.  

Further in the background, a small fountain sprays gently into the air,
clustered villagers conversing happily and enjoying the utopian weather. 
Overall, the paint is suffused with a gentle, peaceful light, rendering
every small detail with sharp clarity yet providing a unified, restful air
to the composition.  

A small signature has been inked in the lower right corner: 'Pikkli'

#DESCRIPTION A round circle of heavy ivory card is here, washed in a gentle
background of a pale, sky-blue.  Careful sponging has removed the paint in
places, creating light, airy clouds.  The paint is suffused with a warm,
sourceless light, and seems oddly wet, yet dry to the touch.  

In the center of the painting, a chestnut bird glides effortlessly along,
auburn-tinged feathers caressing and planing the silent winds.  Wings
splayed, the russet falcon seems beyond weightless, a carefree joy
transcending the bounds of mortal gravity.  An unfelt wind occasionally
ripples the smaller, downy feathers of the bird's underbelly, the paint
shimmering faintly as it moves.  

Careful attention has been payed to the falcon's head.  A slate-grey beak
curves shortly to a lethal point, barred markings on either side of the cere
a fierce highlight to the feral beauty of the winged hunter.  

The eye, however, is the captivating center of the painting.  An alien orb
of amber perfection, the falcon's gaze springs from the paper, seeming to
stare into your very soul with its impassionate, piercing stare. 
Unblinking, unchanging, the gold-rimmed pupil gleams with a playful light
which seems out of place, yet at the same time somehow oddly fitting.  

As your eyes meet the falcon's baleful, wild stare, the paint suddenly
ripples and swirls dramatically.  The falcon twists gracefully in midair,
folds its wings, and stoops out of sight in one fluid instant.  

A small signature wriggles into view at the bottom of the painting,
iridescent ink shimmering merrily: 'Pikkli'.

The tower-eyrie in the ironwood tree
Is less its home, it knows, than lofty gale--
Each moment in the nest would eons be
Which kept it from the soaring zephyr trail.
And once on wing, what wonders to be seen!
The blue Dantaron snakes across plain,
The canopy of Qilarn mottled green,
The snowy peaks of Brintor's high domain.

#NAME Steep Ridge
#DESCRIPTION Patchy snow covers the rocky ground here, and little vegetation is
apparent.  The ridge is quite steep, sloping up sharply to the north, and is
and broken by the rocks that break through the snow.  A sliver of plains can
be seen to the west, sheltering in the lee of the ridge, and beyond that, a
deep ravine scores the earth.  The ridge continues both north and south.  A
small cairn has been erected near the western cliff, snow gathering around
the rocks at the bottom.

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  cairn
#DESCRIPTION A pile of fist-sized rocks, six feet long, has been constructed here,
sufficient to cover a small kankoran or maybe a child.  A larger rock,

by an inexpert hand.

icefields, which stretch out as far as the horizon, small patches of dark
water intermingling with the ice.  Snow covers much of the ground here, save

#NAME Near the Cliffs
#DESCRIPTION Blistering winds blowing through from the north tear at all in their
path, whistling over the lower slopes of a hill rising to the west.  Thick
layers of snow protect the ground from the harsh winds, although nothing has
protected a withered, dried tree, leafless and grey with age.  Small solace
can be had near an outcrop of rock, forming a natural semicircular wall
against the winds.  

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  tree
#DESCRIPTION Grey and near lifeless, this tree clings tenaciously to the eath,
unwilling to admit defeat in the face of the harsh elements.  Not a single
leaf can be found on its branches, and it looks well out of place amongst
the harsh white background.
