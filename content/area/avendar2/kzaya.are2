#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
This male borg is the epitome of eevil.  He wears a complex suit of
biomechanisms that look suspiciously like goth club wear, and his skin is an
unhealthy, pasty white color.  His left hand has been replaced by a cannon
of sorts, and his right is lined entirely with diodes.  His face is 1/4
covered with a large black device that circles his left eye, and spouts a
pipe that runs down his ear to his back.

This creature appears to have once been a nefortu, though its current
state is far from that.  Its ears have been sliced off near their tips,
while what remains is ragged and scrappy.  Its body is blackened with a
layer of dirt and soot that only barely covers the thick network of burn
scars that crisscross its body.  Its fingers have been torturously shaped
into wickedly sharp yet hollow claws, and only dangling strips of burnt
flesh remain where wings once were.  There is no trace of gender on this
being's body, yet its eyes burn with a terrible fire-fed hatred.

of white flame wraps about his arm, flaring as it alights a section of
healthy flesh, reducing it to char and ash.  Somewhere within the arm,
however, a bright light burns briefly, and with a spray of blood the flesh
restores itself to some grim semblance of health again, completing the
gristly cycle.  Wynliean alternately grins and grimaces through the pain as
the flames alternately destroy and renew what is left of his body.

A nauseating reek bubbles up from her depths, following the pulsing and
roiling of distended tissue.  

More horribly, the handmaiden's skin is obviously diseased, and, in some
cases, putrefying.  Boils crisscross her face and neck, while plague sores
are omnipresent.  Oozing, never healing wounds open and close in time with
her burbling motion, and the handmaiden's eyes are a jaundiced yellow.  The
demon speaks rarely, pausing to wretch up the contents of her stomach
between belching forth curses and insults at nothing in particular.

This large golem stands at seven feet, its black steel form an imposing
kankoran figure.  It is constructed of gleaming steel, with thick plates
covering most of its body.  A chill black mist seeps from the joints where
the plates are not, settling in low, dark fog about the construct's feet.  A
mechanical clicking and whirring can be heard from within the golem and
grows louder when it moves.  It's face is forged to appear like that of a
snarling kankoran, the black teeth stained red.  Where its eyes would be,
small red embers seem to burn in rage.

are pulled vertically, much like a cat's.  His features are strong, an
aquiline nose above masculine lips, a chiseled chin below.  His form is
relatively muscular, considering his size.  At the end of long arms sit
longer fingers, each tipped in a razor-like claw.

A tall, rangy caladaran, Astadlari has the weatherbeaten look of the
lifetime pilgrim.  Rough brown skin, the texture of oak bark, has been
tanned an even deeper brown by years on the open road.  Deep-set,
intelligent eyes of a warm brown sparkle with observant energy, flanking a
strong nose.  A broad-lipped mouth is nestled in a long, magnificent beard
of white, curly hair which reaches nearly to his waist.  The crown of the
caladaran's head is shaved clean but for a small lock of hair, bound into a
topknot.  Long, wiry limbs and slender fingers add to the caladaran's
already decidedly scholary air.  A simple, faded robe of neutral grey-brown
adorns the priest's shoulders, and a glowing hourglass sigil marks him as a
devotee of the god Chadraln.

#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
The thing before you is vaguely reminicent of an imp, albeit one larger
than its brethren.  The flesh of the j'nakra is a sickly white hue, its
paleness implaceably unwholesome.  The limbs of the beast end in sets of
piercing and rending claws while its pinched, impish face sports a grinning
mouth of jagged bone spurs.  A pair of rapidly flapping wings support the
creature, the membranes of its bat-like members a strikingly unreflective
black.  Discerning these features is made all the more difficult by the
j'nakra's only semi-visible nature.  

The j'nakra never is fully visible, pieces of its body always seeming to
fade into the air.  Even as the limbs shimmer back into existance, others
fade creating an unsettling picture of semi-intagibility.  The beating of
its wings and the tittering of its deadly mouth suddenly cease on occasion
as the sources of the sound disappear, the ensuing quiet soon shattered as
its flesh continues its dance through the ether.

Lengths of blackened and tarnished chain obscure, for the most part, the

skeleton, drawn so tight that spurs of bone edge through.  The chains, links
serrated and cruelly barbed, draped over the demon's form give forth an
unsettling clatter as they swing dangerously about, running over and through
the Nvae'gra's flesh, and drag along the ground.  

Beneath the shroud of iron, twin points of glowing red smoulder in the
sockets of a skull only partially covered by flesh.  Dark skin has peeled
away from the face of this creature, clinging to the lower jaw tautly,
attempting to hold fast to its last, razor-toothed purchase.

happened upon a canyon while travelling, just off of the arid waste.  While

drove him into the depths of the tunnels that run through the canyon.  He

#LORE Imbued with a magical rune of cooling from the water scholars of Krilin,
this helm was made to be an aid to a travelling army of Krilin soldiers who
set out to quash the menace of a large conclave of followers of Bayyal in
Kzaya Ha Canyon.  Once they arrived in the canyon, the soldiers met stiff
resistance in the form of droves of nefortean fire scholars and templars. 
The soldiers perished quickly, yet the bloodlust of the followers of the God
of Hate was yet unquenched, so they turned on each other.  Once the dust of
battle cleared, few of the remaining "victors" from the battle with the
Krilin soldiers remained.  They returned to the vast network of tunnels
within the walls of the Canyon and became highly reclusive, each trying
to prove themselves more worthy than the others in the eyes of their God.

weeks and demanding that he make a weapon "worthy of them," the scholar
finally conceded and set to work on creating these gloves.  The bandits felt
triumphant, and let the scholar go.  Unfortunately for them, a lone nefortu
earth templar wandered up just as the scholar fled.  Fascinated by the
gloves, he demanded to see them.  When the bandits told him where to shove
his request, he made quick work of the crew with a swarm of meteors. 
Plucking the gloves from the corpse of the bandits' leader, the templar
returned home to Kzaya Ha Canyon, the frightened scholar far from his

#LORE This bracer was once worn by Lieutenant Juvha of the Kor Thrandirian
military on an expedition to Ashta Harrud.  On the way, the Lieutenant's
forces were jumped by a raiding party of bandits within the Savannah, and
the overly vain officer was slain.  The bandits then took their booty to a
hidden encampment where, unbeknownst to them, a group of nefortu thieves
from the nearby canyon had begun pillaging their stash.  The thieves snuck
out before being detected and easily slid their daggers into the backs of
the battle-weary bandits as they returned to their camp.  Pleased with their
stash, the thieves snuck back home and held a raucous celebration, in which
they lit up the canyon with flame and danced victoriously.  

Their celebration dance did not go unnoticed, however, by the denizens of
the tunnels within the canyon.  Inside the tunnels, the templar Lidjaza
became furious at the noisemaking, and set out to put a halt to their party.
Harnessing the power of the small fire that they had lit by which they
celebrated, Lidjaza easily bowled the group over, setting thief after thief
aflame.  The final living partygoer-- the same one who held this bracer--
quivered in a corner as Lidjaza approached, his eyes alight with flame. 
With a huge blast of novic flame, Lidjaza scorched the whimpering thief
straight through, burning the bracer as well.  Despite the fact that it was
melted slightly, Lidjaza took it and placed it within a secret hiding
compartment, since he had no immediate use for it himself.

Earendam called that a group of his most elite soldiers head to the depths
of the canyon and put an end to the travelling band of mercenaries.  This
was easily accomplished, since the mercenaries were far less skilled than
were the soldiers who hunted them, but once the soldiers had cleared the
canyon of its guilty parties, they turned their eyes upon a mysterious
tunnel that was set in the wall of the Canyon.  Curious, they headed into
it, hoping that they might find a stash of gold and wealth.  Instead,
however, they met with a number of powerful nefortu masters of flame.  The
soldiers fought valiantly to get to the end of the cave, where a number of
the nefortu that they had hunted had begged to show them a wealth of goods. 
Instead of finding this, they came upon a very angry earth templar.  After
their armour had been weakened by the fire scholars and templars, the
templar-- a large nefortu named Vaakam-- crushed their weakened armour
easily and drove most of the soldiers to flee.  A few unfortunates remained,
however, and one of the dead had held this glaive which Vaakam took as a
prize.

#LORE This cape was made by a master cloakmaker from Earendam from wool grown
by the Lsakia tribe that was gathered by one of his underlings on an
excursion to Ashta Harrud.  It was created for a wealthy traveller, who
wanted something light yet warm while on an excursion to the barren north of
the plains of Ryarl.  Unfortunately, the map to Ryarl was sold to the
wealthy adventurer from the shop of a crooked businessman and led him south
rather than north, to a barren place called Kzaya Ha Canyon.  He only
finally realized that his path had led him astray by the time that a group
of four nefortu thieves had snuck up on him and plunged a dagger into his
back.  The cloak was taken by one of the thieves and remained on her back
until it was taken from her by a group of wandering adventurers.

#LORE Made by an journeyman cobbler in Var Bandor, these sandals were created
for comfort rather than looks.  Their soles were crafted with intense
precision, but the leather that was left for their upper part was only
scrap, hence their ragged design.  They were sold to a young templar who set
off to explore Avendar and unwittingly stumbled across Kzaya Ha Canyon. 
Unaware of the myriad of warnings and angry animals set about the entrance
to the tunnels, the templar-- who just happened to be ethron, and thusly
light on his feet-- slipped into the tunnels of Kzaya Ha Canyon, but was
brought to a fiery early grave by a fireball set off by a young nefortu fire
scholar.  

The scholar was unaware of his visitor until he heard the ethron's death
cry, and took the sandals from the freshly dead corpse as a prize.

What appears to have once been a streambed begins here.  The only

surface of the sand and dirt, and a number of erosion-rounded stones tossed
in amongst the chaff from the walls of the canyon.  A large fissure with
rounded edges in the eastern wall of the canyon is stained with white salty
deposits, marking it as the one time source of water for this stream.  The
dust and grit within the wall of the canyon show that this spring has not
been active for ages.  The streambed deepens to the north, while the ground
evens out to the east and south.

#NAME The Entrance to a Tunnel
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
Set back a few feet from the edge of the canyon, this entryway appears to
have been carved for some grandiose purpose.  Nearly twenty feet in
diameter, the entryway is impressively large and imposing, despite the
obviously less-than-artisan quality of its carving.  A bust and wings of a
nefortu have been cruedly carved in the rock to give the impression of
emerging from the wall.  Its face is contorted into one of rage, and it
angles a spear downward at the center of the entryway.  Phrases are carved
along the edge of the entryway, in nefortu on the left and in common on the
right.  A ledge leads out to the body of the canyon to the west.

light from outside streams in, illuminating this area completely.  The light

The walls, floor, and ceiling of this tunnel look as if they were slowly

surfaces appear to be like a reflection of water themselves, since their
surfaces are lightly scalloped in a shape that resembles waves.  A rainbow
of brown tones ranging from light tan to deep charcoal can be seen in
the sedimentary layers of stone, which makes the walls look even more like
the undulating surface of an ocean.  The ripples on the walls break here,
heading to the north and east.  A smaller, more narrow tunnel continues
northward.

#NAME An Ancient Cavern
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
The northwest corner of the cavern, is mostly empty, save for a small
circular opening cut in the floor.  This hole, which is about a foot in
diameter, is rimmed with a double ring and a line of jagged nefortu script. 
The hole itself disappears into blackness almost immediately, yet a thick
scent of rot wafts upward from it.  The atmosphere in here is stifling, for
the heavy darkness gives the room a claustrophobic feel while intense,
scorching heat emanates from the walls themselves.  The cavern continues to
the east, while a large pillar of flame illuminates the area with a
flickering red light to the south.

The plagued flesh-land comes to a crest here briefly, before angling

covered in a greenish, crusted scab.  Along the sides of the scab is a line
of fresh pus, which lends a thick smell of sickness to the air here.  A few
of the pale grasses have become entangled in the sore, some of which appear
to be partially knitted into the surface of its scab.  Around each blade of
grass, the scab is darkened, and a thin layer of plagued ooze slips out from
underneath the scab.

The few grasses that grow from the fleshy ground here fall off completely

maturity.  Some are a deep red colour, lined with several veins.  Others are
purplish-black, their uneven tone belying the overextended nature of the
flesh above them.  Others have ruptured, and spilled a reddish orange pus
over the nearby pustules.  Their growth here is so prolific that travel in
any direction but south is impossible.

#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
A red glow emanates from everwhere and nowhere atop this spire, which
seems to be but one of many such hole-riddled edifices in the general
vicinity.  The spires bristle upward in their thousands from a vast mass of
viscous magma and burning black slag.  The lower parts of the great spires
are, particularly towards the rim of the city, heated to a molten glow,
while their upper reaches vary in texture from twisting bundles of glassy
fibre to thick, reflective slabs of rock.  Rust-coloured iron bridges
connect adjacent spires, or in some places leap high above the surface of
the city in precarious highways.  The myriad denizens of the city, the
thousand breeds of demonkind who are the citizens of the void city Logor,
travel across these bridges and through the spires, their actions masked by
distance.  

The immediate vicinity appears to be more structured than the others.  In
the surface of the volcanic glass is a pentagram, perfectly formed and
