#DESCRIPTION This large bear is a mass of thick fur and bulky muscle.  Standing four
feet tall at the shoulder while on all fours, and well over six while
standing, the bear's large, rounded flanks and rump and barrel chest give it
a deceptive air of slow clumsiness.  Paws the size of dinner plates have
black, calloused pads and sharp, dirty-white claws several inches long which
curve to lethal, blunt points.  A thick neck swathed in muscle, fat, and fur
supports a large head.  Small, piggish eyes flank a boxy snout.  The bear
moves with surprising agility for a creature of its bulk, rich black pelt
rippling with its movements.

the lower half of the wolf's body, continuing to the cheeks and underside of
the tail.  Razor-sharp, pointed teeth, line the wolf's maw.

Large, textured scales of a murky ochre cover a yellow-brown skin.  Dull
bands of darker brown run the length of the snake's body.  The serpent moves
with amazing speed and sinuous strength.  Hooded black eyes watch the world
impassively, the triangular head alert and watchful.  Two tiny indentations
can be seen above the snake's mouth, below the nostrils.  A pale tongue
flickers out periodically, tasting the air.

closer examination yields a form in large part, if not wholely, alien to
this plane of existence.  Small worm-like tentacles dot his body, grey worms
covered with sucker-like protuberances.  Breaking the integrity of his
flesh, jaws both large and small clatter noisily as Isetaton floats about
the room.  Thin eyestalks which sprout from around his neck scan all
directions about Isetaton, while the eyes set in the center of his face are
little more than blackened orbs.

canine jaw, lined with a double-layer of smashed, jagged incisors.  Bounding
forward with each step, the Orzub's claws seem to whistle through the air
with ominous speed.

#ALIGN 0 0
#DESCRIPTION A seemingly slapdash construction of metal, wood, clay, sand, flesh, and
several other less-easily identifiable materials, this golem seems to be in
a constant state of flux.  Rippling and shifting patches roil across the
surface of its body, the wood decaying and re-forming, metal rusting and
corroding before becoming bright again.  Flesh seems to wither and age, and
then to regain its vitality.  The entire golem seems fluid and shifting, and
often flows around or through obstacles rather than avoiding them.  Two
gleaming eyes of greasy quicksilver, rippling as the golem moves, sit in the
round head.

#DESCRIPTION This construct is made from nude, hairless-pink flesh, which has an
unhealthy, inflamed look to it.  The motions of the thing are rubbery, but
supported as if by some unearthly string.  The distinctly humanesque arms
and legs, however end in stumps of tentacular bundles rather than digits. 
There is no exact head which can be identified on the construct, but there
are a single large, nodular mound which rises off its torso.  No openings or
separate organs are visible which might indicate any sort of sensory
apparatus other than touch, though two faint depressions occupy the spaces
normally reserved for eyes.

#LORE The skull of the demilich Vila is a yellowed lump of bone, its features
worn smooth by the sands of time.  Its eyes flicker with a dim red light,
and a faint septic aroma wafts from its calcified exterior.  Strikingly,
each of its teeth has been replaced by a perfectly faceted diamond.  

The archmage Vila was a great human scholar, who lived during the golden age
of humanity following the War of Fire.  Tempted and seduced by the ancient
magics of the Nyakigah Sha Yith (The Black Libram of Souls), he turned his
considerable talent to the dark arts.  

It is unclear what his true motive was, but Vila left Avendar, to find
planes more conducive to certain unsettling creations.  In one of these dark
places, he created Sothmogga, a cosmic horror which lived only to devour and
consume living energies.  

Using his own considerable talents as a planar traveler, Vila created a
gateway for Sothmogga to travel to a place where it could feed and grow.  He
lead the thing to the Grove of the Celanim, a world populated by beings of
almost pure energy.  Living near the planes of light, the Celanim lived in
splendor, tending their exquisitely lovely trees.  

Heedless of their danger, the Celanim never knew the great Sothmogga was
upon them.  The tentacular horror roared through the Grove, laying waste to
the once proud and powerful people.  It grew as it fed, drawing sustenance
from the life energy of the place.  When it was completely fed, it had more
than quadrupled in size, and vastly grown in dark power.  

So powerful was the beast that the archmage could no longer control it.  It
turned its sight to the prime material, hoping to consume its teeming life. 
Fortunately for Avendar, the great templar Converu met the demonic Sothmogga
at its portal to our world, and impaled it in single combat with Anirim's
spear.  

Vila, justfiably fearing the vengeance both divine as well from Celanim,
fled into the planes.  Over the centuries he was hunted by his numerous
enemies, all determined to bring him to justice.  Forced to draw on the
Black Libram to elude pursuit, he realized that the tome was coming to
dominate his actions.  

Learning of the deepest secrets of the Sha Yith, Vila sought to preserve
himself in a transcendent form of undeath as a demilich.  His spirit would
be completely free to roam the planes, while the remnants of his mortal form
would decay to a skull.  

At least partially successful, Vila managed to transfer part of his power
into a skull.  Unfortunately, he had by this time given up the tome, and
rushed to complete the process despite the presence of other powers.  He
found his spirit completely fettered to the skull.  Having successfully
changed his form, his enemies found the trail to the scholar cold.  However,
other, more demonic powers had taken an interest in the scholar would be
immortal...

#DESCRIPTION PREFACE

You hold in your hands the first of the volumes in my Codex.  The motivation
for writing these volumes came about when I realized the sheer volume of
ignorance among the scholars of the Dantaron valley regarding the truth
nature of our cosmos.  

Too often, we scholars turn devote ourselves to minutia, spending years to
master a handful of spells while heedless of the world passing around us. 
For those of us with a concern for the unity of knowledge, and the awareness
that the cosmic balance can be unseated, this situation is intolerable.  

The actions we take here in the prime material have consequences in the
multiverse, and the converse is also true.  And, while we mortals can no
longer tread the planes with the ease of the ancient alatharya, paths still
exist for those willing to find them.  Thusly, I have commence work on this
Codex of tomes concerning the planes.  

I begin my Codex with a study of the plane in some ways nearest to ours, the
Dream.  Use the knowledge within as all knowledge must be used -- with
responsibility.

The planes, as they say, are the playground of the gods.  But, as most
scholars of them will attest, not every plane is a direct creation of a
deity out of raw essence.  In particular, there is no tale of creation of
the dream.  Could the Dream have arisen as a sort of reflection of the
mental and spiritual attributes inherent in the sentience of all living
things?  

Regardless, it is known that various deities have had influences or even
demesnes in the dream.  Of course, we know that the ch'taren have some
affinity for the Dream, as well as their goddess Rystaia.  [Though as we
will see in a later volume, the ch'taren did not come to Avendar from the
Dream] Before the War of Night, the aelin venerated a deity of art and
beauty who had demesnes in the Dream, but his worship vanished at the end of
the war.  

(Written in margin in red ink is the phrase: "The identity of this deity is
left as an exercise to the reader.") 

We also know that a demon city, know as Chaigidon, sits very near a planar
boundary between the Dream and the Void.  Like all dark things, it exerts an
influence in our nightmares, and its presence is reflected in certain areas
of the Dream.  

(Written in the margin in red ink is the word: "Zyal")

Along with various deities and demigods, some very rare mortals find that
upon entering the Dream that they have a much larger than normal measure of
control over the environs there.  First recorded by the alatharya, who
called such individuals the "Zhelead Yha ('Dream Lords').  These gifted
dreamers often find a compelling affinity with the Dream, and will often
eventually abandon life in the material world for a new existence on that
plane.  Such beings eventually grow to something like demigods on the Dream,
making their own demesnes, living extremely long lives in the altered
timestream there.

All my travels eventually lead me to one place, which I found to be one of
the most interesting in the Dream, despite its rather mundane setting. 
There is a small inn, sometimes located near the boughs of the Nightmare
Forest, other times atop a high cliff, and other times simply on the side of
a common road.  Named the Eventide, the inn is a dimensional nexus of some
kind.  It is certainly a part of the Dream, but it has many unusual
denizens, many of whom are planar travelers themselves.  There are doorways
in the Inn which are said to leave the Dream, and are rumored to provide an
escape for those physically there.  For myself, I dared not enter the portal
in spirit form -- for what if my spirit became irretrievably lost to my
body?  I tarried for a while at the inn, and heard quite a few wild tales. 
To my surprise, I discovered several travelers from the mortal planes there
at the Inn, who were completely unaware that they were in the Dream!  I can
only conjecture that there are entrances to the Inn from the prime, though I
can find no trace of their existence.

Other areas of the dream are less nebulously defined, but it is known there
is a distinct region associated with nightmares, centered on an extremely
dark forest.  Horrors of every type abound there, as well as stories of a
black past.  Legend even has that a dark god died in the depths of the
forest, but it seems no one has penetrated far enough into its depths to
say.  

(Written here in the margin in red ink is one word: "Serachel")

There are also many places that mirror our own waking world, but very few do
so exactly.  In my travels in the Dream, I stumbled upon a precise replica
of Var Bandor, entirely populated by clockwork men.  After exploring the
Dream analogue of the Dantaron, I returned, only to find the city completely
gone.  Months later, I found the city again, but its inhabitants were,
inexplicably, all large brown rats.  While I could find neither rhyme nor
reason in these changes, experienced dream walkers claim that most changes
in the Dream are in response to subtle metaphorical changes in the world at
large.  

I also spied many things in the Dream that were either not of the parts of
Avendar I had traveled to, or they were of other worlds entirely.  Several
times, I saw a silver city in the distance, but never reached it.  I passed
through at least three deserts, walked through an ocean, and was forced to
wend my way out of a maze constructed of frozen tears.

When I made my own travels to the Dream, I attempted to keep as many notes
as possible, writing down every experience as soon as I had awoken.  Many
times, one location would be changed, moved some distance from the first
time I saw it.  General patterns remained the same, but change, rather than
stability, was the rule when traveling in the Dream.  

It is dubious to imagine a region constantly changing and infinite in extent
as having a well-defined shape or topology, but there are a few relatively
fixed points which bear mentioning as part of the Dream's geography.  

If the Dream has a center, it is the Evermore Plains.  Always changing, and
perhaps infinite in extent, the plains seem to link to a large number of
demesnes within the Dream.  The plains themselves are mainly scrubland or
barren, with one principle denizen -- wispy gray spirits, who periodically
interact with visitors to the place (often in a rather hostile manner!)  . 
Who or what these spirits are is a matter of some debate, but the most
plausible explanation is that they are the souls of spirits who have been
trapped in the Dream, and for whatever reason are unable or unwilling to
leave.  The plains are also marked with odd standing stones, whose peculiar
patterns seems to indicate paths leading to various parts of the Dream.

There is also the possibility that the powerful ancient magic spell of
"planar travel" could reach the Dream (as it could most locales).  However,
as the power of such ancient spells is currently finite in nature, even a
scholar who knew the spell might not be able to use it as the alatharya once
did.  

There are also rumors of very powerful spirit scholars, psionicists, and
even void scholars finding their way into the Dream.  Whether this is the
result of secret spells only the most powerful in their element has access
to, or a random result of delving into those forms of magic is unknown. 
Whatever is the case, the explicit conditions relating to such travel has
been kept a secret.

For those seeking other entry mechanisms to this plane, there are a number
of avenues which have been featured in legend and myth.  The main vein of
historical research in this regard begins with what little history we have
of the ancient alatharya, who almost certainly trafficked regularly in the
Dream.  

The principal evidence for this is an archaeological find known as the
Dilaen Tablet.  Found in one of the numerous alatharya ruins on which
Ilodaiya is built, the tablet is half of an engraving which discusses the
means by which the elder alatharya entered the Dream.  

Evidently, the alatharya used magical artifacts known as 'Orbs of Dreaming'
to open gateways to the Dream when needed.  The stones were broken in
certain "soft" locations, opening up temporary portals.  They used the
expanse of the Dream to scout new lands, to find exotic materials and magic,
and purportedly to travel to places accessible from there.  

Unfortunately for us, most, if not all of these orbs were lost in the
Sundering and the dark millennia that followed.  I know of at least one
augury which was cast by a scholar of the void, who sought such an orb.  His
infernal sources revealed that at least one such orb remained in existence,
but he was devoured by the same sources before he could reveal its location.
Even if such an orb were found, however, we would have to find one of the
special locations used by the alatharya to create a portal.

statues in Yithoul by Sydonus."  )

The effects on mortals seem to be remarkably uniform, with variations only
based on the size and weight of the creature.  Ketsari can either be eaten
as it is grown (it has a faintly bitter taste), or boiled and dissolved into
a liquid (no real taste, but there is a faint tingle when the liquid is
imbibed).  In small doses, it induces dream-like hallucinations, which are
generally quite pleasant, but in rare cases are extremely terrifying. 
Larger doses induce a trance-like sleep, in which the user has access to the
dream world in the same fashion as the dream walker.  

The most striking property of the Ketsari, though, is that there are
credible accounts of large doses of the fungus physically transporting the
user into the Dream.  There is an ambiguity to these reports, as apparently
the fungus appears to possess this power only in certain historical epochs. 
In recent memory, the last recorded use of the ketsari fungus in this
fashion occurred just after the War of Night.  Since then, the fungus has
only functioned as a gateway for spiritual entry into the Dream. 
Interestingly, historical accounts record several such periods where the
fungus lost this ability, then regained it, each such period marked by a
planar disruption.  In our current epoch, it seems that the fungus is once
more without this ability.  When it will return again is a matter of some
conjecture, as is what event could spark this ability.  

(Written in the margin of the text at this point in red ink: "The Coming of
Serachel")

The visions given by ketsari fungus are somewhat addictive, so the use of
the mushroom is frowned upon in the more martial principalities.  It is
through the ketsari that I traveled to the Dream, however, and I can vouch
for its potency.

While the ability to see reflections of the physical world proved of great
use to the early dream walkers, it still suffered from limitations.  Nothing
found in the Dream could be brought back to the mortal world by the dreamer.
And, while dreamers have the powers of their mortal selves, it was apparent
that powerful residents of the dream had some ability to simply ignore such
effects.  (A possible explanation for this is that dreamers have an
incorporeal, illusion-like existence there, so its most powerful denizens
can simply "disbelieve" in their existence!)  Finally, dreamers were limited
by the odd nature of the flow of time while sleeping.  Sometimes, their trip
to the Dream would seem to last months -- others, merely a few breaths.  

There is some evidence the alatharya had an interest in the Dream as well,
and brought back a plant native to the Dream to Avendar.  This plant, a
mushroom known as 'ketsari fungus', has a wide variety of unusual
properties, most relating to the Dream.  It is an open question whether the
alatharya used the fungus in the way that we moderns do, but I am of the
opinion that they did not, in fact, intend it for the use we put it to, for
reasons we shall discuss shortly.  

Ketsari fungus tends to grow in unusual places.  Oddly, there appears to be
neither rhyme nor reason to the conditions under which it will flourish. 
Those who tend it claim that they can sense where it will grow, and plant
accordingly.  Other scholars, of whom I am one, believe that ketsari fungus
thrives in places who have some correspondence to the places in the Dream
where ketsari fungus thrives.  Thus, if ketsari fungus grows only in a two
feet plot of soil on the edge of a forest, perhaps this is because in the
Dream, the same spot is a rotting stump covered by wild ketsari.

The dreamers enter while sleeping, and are free to roam the Dream as beings
with similar power and possessions to their mortal frames.  Return from the
dream is normally an effort of will, but it is an established fact that
powerful entities in the Dream can hold a dreamer there, and there are
actually locations in that plane that seem to prevent the dreamer from
returning.  Fortunately, these are not numerous.  

Powers in the mortal world are reflected in the Dream.  Dreamers are
generally confined to traveling via conventional means (walking, or by
mount), but rumors persist about some dream walkers having the ability to
transport themselves to other locations in the Dream, in a manner somewhat
akin to the 'blink' spell employed by templars of air.  Such an ability
seems rare, as while I never found any evidence of its veracity. 
Individuals gifted with psionic talents find that they work in the Dream,
but their magnitude of their power seems to fluctuate widely depending on
location.  I conjecture that the medium that the mentally gifted used to
propagate their gift is actually more or less abundant depending on region. 


Dreamwalkers who are harmed, or killed in the dream run the risk of
suffering psychic harm.  Victims of such maladies may exhibit symptoms
ranging from mild phobias to raving violence.  Others simply lapse into a
comatose state, never to recover.  There appears to be little truth to the
old saw that "what happens to you in the dream happens to you in the real
world" for these mental and spiritual travelers there, but rumors persist of
rare occurrences.  I have researched the matter, and could find no
legitimate case of the phenomena, and so must reluctantly conclude it is
only a myth.  

(Here in the text, a calm, deliberate hand has penned in red ink the word
"Lilisa".)  

Dreamwalkers may actually take others with them on their jaunts, provided
they are in physical contact with their companions, all of whom must also be
asleep.  In the Dream, the companions are kept there by the will of the
dreamer.  Should the dreamer not periodically focus on the presence of his
companions, they will gradually fade from view, returning to the normal
modes of sleep.

The first, and most common type of directed contact with the Dream often
begins in the shamanistic traditions of primitive tribes.  In these tribes,
there is a shaman, or holy man, who generally has some small influence in
the magics of a particular element, or as a sort of fledgling druid.  Having
discovered some few tricks of an element, the shaman often seeks more, but
lacks the discipline (and, frankly, the resources) for the concentrated
study provided by formal training a scholar.  The shaman, hungry for more
mystical experience, will turn to the most obviously "magical" thing in his
life -- his dreams.  Most of us have had dreams of flying, or other such
wondrous things, and to the accepting mind of the neophyte magic-user, it
may very well seem only logical that dreams are a gateway to a world where
magic is more powerful.  

So, the shamans will constantly seek out more control, or time spent in the
dream realms, often augmented by a touch of magic or certain hallucinatory
drugs.  The time spent in dreaming is to the shaman's advantage, of whom
some will learn the trick of remaining in the Dream for longer periods, as
well as increased control.  There is an element both of inborn aptitude for
this, along with one of experience.  

Individuals who have mastered this art have been called by various names
throughout history.  Some of the most common are "dream walker", "dreamer",
"dream voyagers, or even dream worms" (a shuddeni expression).  Access to
the Dream by these individuals is a sort of entry of mind and spirit
(something like the projection spell used by spirit scholars) across the
planar divide.

The Dream is not, as some scholars have intimated, simply a pocket dimension
attached to the prime material.  It certainly does not have an independent
existence like the true greater planes, but its vast, nearly infinite extent
teems with a diversity of content and form.  

Some have called the Dream a shadow -- others, a mirror.  Both are to some
extent correct, for the dream is in large part a reflection of the world of
the prime material.  But, in its farthest regions, beyond the places tread
by mortal kind, there are sections of the Dream which are completely
divorced from any physical reality of which we are aware.  Could the Dream
reflect other physical realities?  

The dream is also unique in that the minds of even the most commonplace
mortal will most likely touch it during the course of their life.  The
experience of touching the altered reality of the Dream is something most
will ascribe to a natural phenomena, but in reality it points to the
extremely deep psychic bonds which exist between the prime and the Dream.  

But consistent study of the Dream requires more than the random and
fragmentary visions of sleep.  The methods of contacting the dream are
numerous, and, perhaps, even infinite.  The "veil", or planar boundary
between our own and the Dream varies in consistency throughout historical
epoch, but it has always been that it is the easiest of the planes to reach
-- though certainly not always the safest!

translucent flesh underneath.  Sliced down the middle, the each large prawn
have been stuffed with a quantity of shellfish salad.  Shreds of lobster,
tomatoes, sliced celery and endive in a creamy tarragon sauce fill the
prawns, garnished with a few capers.

#NAME The Feature Room
#DESCRIPTION (non-coding:)
* Progs for called animals.
* Progs for Earth/Water Elementals.
(coding:)
* Tweak findherb so it's not impossible to find anything but 3-4 herbs in
  your entire liftime. Make it easier to get useful herbs.
* An *exit* flag fly_only This makes pits,etc. a lot easier to build.
* A 'twisted ankle' affect. See Ramc for the grisly details!
* A tick_prog.
* Add 'noctural' and 'diurnal' flags to mobs.
* Re-implement the carrying limits in some form.
* Change swim and what not.
* New gladiator skill 'final gambit'.
* Add more animals able to be called by Rangers (snow wolves? panthers?
  mountain lions? wolverines? moose? xorns?) relative to territory.
* Brief snoop (If this doesn't make sense, check the feature forum)

  
* Make it so you can only waylay if the target can't see you.
* Make it so you can only backstab if the target can't see you.
* Make the mob form flag 'construct' make them immune to stuff you'd
  expect constructs to be immune to.
* Make cloudkill a real, non-hack spell. With saving throws and stuff.
* [Iandir] Make an apply command that mortals use to apply for houses. Imms
  can list all applicants for a given house or sigil, and can read
  applications like backgrounds, even if the mortal isn't online.
  Applications persist until withdrawn or until pfile is gone. Mortals can't
  apply for more than one house/sigil at once, and the Imm view shows whether
  they've changed which they apply to.
* Mortal-run houses! By paying a buttload of platinum, mortals can form their
  own house. They get a [HOUSE] tag by their name that only their house
  members can see, they get their own channel, and they get an extitle that's
  automatically applied to anyone in their house. Obviously they get the power
  to induct and uninduct as well. Also obviously, house names and extitles get
  approved by imms upon creation.
* mpdatarandom, sets the current data_prog to a random line
* a variable that equals the number of entries in a data prog
* Ventriloquate should let you specify a language
* Lame: The noemote echo players see is "You are anti-social!"
* We could use "psay" to go with "pmote"
* Add a "buyback" function, where players can buy back items they've accidentally
  sold to shops for the same price they just received.

C. Fake exit flags no longer work? I flagged up and down fake in room 4106,
   and after reboot the fake flags were gone.
D. {rPsionicist focuses seem to be extremely difficult to break. Most people
   starve to death before they are broken.{n
E. {rWhen people log on, their current hp doesn't include their con bonus, so
   they are injured even if they logged out at full health.{n
F. At one point, you could put a container inside another container if the
   first one was no_take. This has changed somehow. Clockmaker quests
   require this to be possible. :( :( :(
G. Posters on the log forum are claiming they've gained 0 or -1 mana when
   levelling.
H. People still standing over you at altar mercy bug.
I. Tanned items often have their wear slots mysteriously change.
J. Garrote bug seems to persist: garrotee is not affected with inability to
   cast.
K. Stampede doesn't seem to work at all
M. Nolag switches off when you switch into a mob. :(
* Ghosts can bandage
* Name completion should not work with mpcommands

#NAME Suggestion Box
#DESCRIPTION * An enamour song for bards.  Aeolis knows details.
* Drawbacks for thieves/assassins wearing heavy armors, relative to strength
  and dexterity. Less attacks, less dodging.
* Psionicists - Increase chances of Read Thoughts a bit so it's more reliable?
* The ability to use 'enhance reflexes' on other PC's. As of now, Psionicists
  aren't very viable in ranking (they're pretty PK-oriented), and this would
  provide a well-needed boost. If you want, increase the mana-cost per tick,
  but it would be a heck of a lot more useful.
* Make it so trying to disarm a nodisarm weapon lags the wielder of
  the nodisarm weapon, so that nodisarm is not unconditionally good.
* Cast_prog and all_cast_prog: trigger when spell is cast on target, or cast
  in room. (Argument would be spell vnum and %)
* An *exit* flag that requires water breathing.
* Light sleep lessen/negate damage modifiers for sleeping.
* Have hide/sneak/slice/etc be affected by encumbrance, a la casting
* A no-dirt flag for rooms. If there isn't enough dirt to kick.
* [Arkh] Give Thieves a skill that let's them know if they've been spotted
 (where or look, take your pick)
* Take the delay between castings off of Phantasmal Creation.
* Listen should also be able to intercept tells (jury is out on house
  channels, but probably not)
* A watcher skill to 'drag' people under mercy.
* Make watcher skills more effective: pugil hits for more strength, twirl
  hits more often (not lags, just hits).
* Add the ability to tell what damage type finished off the corpse to
  investigate death. Unlike iding the killer, this always succeeds.
* A 'daylight' spell for spirit scholars that illuminates a number of rooms
  in a burst from where the spell was cast. Doesn't move with caster.
* Make rangers more interesting. Ramc has ideas. Ask him.
* Make reduced EP to hero levels for people with multiple heroes/good
  standing on an account.
* An 'ignore' command used to ignore a player -- no prays, tells or
  communication heard..
* mpoload <vnum> in self - for progs on containers. No way for a container
  to be assured of referencing itself as is.
* A fast_crumble pc flag we can slap on players we suspect of hoarding eq.
* Allow Rangers to sell their tans. It really makes sense.
* An Escape Artist skill for Watchers. See Ramc.
* A "nofly" flag that imms can slap on people to punish them. "The Gods
  have hobbled your wings!"
* Waylay should have a drastically reduced chance if target can see you.
* Be able to pick your characters birthday at some amount of account points.
* [Dov] command to toggle faction change reports (can be spammy).
* [Dov] an ifcheck for memory values on a different mob  *slobber*
* [Dov] ability to name toggleoffaff just as one does with the generic aff.
* [Dov] customize trophy part names so that they can be used with give_progs.

fades into blackness, until all you see is the understanding of their being.

#NAME Suggestion Box
#DESCRIPTION * Progs for Earth/Water Elementals.
* A Summon: Phandaal spell
* Escape (Raider skill) is almost exactly like dive, minus the damage.
* An enamour song for bards.  Aeolis knows details.
* Drawbacks for thieves/assassins wearing heavy armors, relative to strength
  and dexterity. Less attacks, less dodging.
* Make it so imms can see the vnum of the room that people write notes from,
  and edit the help files
* Fix if isweather
* A nodisarm flag for mobs. So they can't be disarmed or have winter wind,
  ect, drop their weapons.
* Extra novelty slots: earrings, eyes (for spectacles and monocles), tattoes
* The ability to have a wizi slot on players in which we can append progs.
* Psionicists - Increase chances of Read Thoughts a bit so it's more reliable?
* The ability to use 'enhance reflexes' on other PC's. As of now, Psionicist's
  aren't very viable in ranking (they're pretty PK-oriented), and this would
  provide a well-needed boost. If you want, increase the mana-cost per tick,
  but it would be a heck of a lot more useful.
* Add more animals able to be called by Rangers (snow wolves? panthers?
  mountain lions? wolverines?) relative to territory. Maybe even add it as an
  area flag, so we can choose what animals are able to be called in our area.
* Progs for called animals.
* Make it so trying to disarm a nodisarm weapon lags the wielder of
  the nodisarm weapon, so that nodisarm is not unconditionally good.
* Two mob flags. Track_open and Track_ram. The mob will openram doors to get to it's quarry.
* Tweak findherb so it's not impossible to find anything but 3-4 herbs in
  your entire liftime. Make it easier to get useful herbs.
* Cast_prog and all_cast_prog: trigger when spell is cast on target, or cast
  in room. (Argument would be spell vnum and %)
* An *exit* flag that requires water breathing.
* Light sleep lessennegate damage modifiers for sleeping.
* Have stabilize go away in air.
* Have hide/sneak/slice/etc be affected by encumbrance, a la casting
* The ability to set damtype and damverb in mobobj progs (Add me to the feature room!)
* A 'clearbuffer' command for everyone, that lets them cancel all incoming (spammed, etc) commands. Works despite fight-lag, so you can decide *NOT* to bash if you're getting spam-bashed and your command still hasn't gotten through.
* An echo when someone tries to hand you something, but you're too weighed down.
* A no-dirt flag for rooms. If there isn't enough dirt to kick.
* Replace Sanctuary/Heal/Cure Critical/etc with water-themed spells. Sanctuary == Ward of the Seas?
* Ramc: Ghost should be mute, imho. 
* Change Shroud of Nyogthua to be a radius of effect, rather than area-based.
  note + (See Jolinn for more details.)

#NAME That Weird Room of Yendri's Wishlist
#DESCRIPTION You look upon a well builded reptilian creature.
He is compleatly covered in dark green scales.
Broad shoulders and muscular body tells you that Shazzar is in the top form.
You can also notice a lot of scars all around his body.
His dragon liked head, looking almost pretty for the one of his race.
Light blue, snake eyes are fixing one spot, blinking slowly.
You can see red forked tongue that flicks in moments.  
Shazzar is in excellent condition.

================

Here is a list of things Yendri wants:
* Sac progs for all gods. They were outlined on the Wiki, I don't know if they're still there.
* Make the lesser gods (Alajial, Sythrak) saccable-to.
* Dual-sphere spells!
* Monks! I'll even build the Remoter Monastery, if necessary.
* Redoing titles for female gladiators to read "gladiatrix"

#DESCRIPTION This pit is dug out of the surrounding earth, and of comparatively recent
construction.  Mounds of earth surround the bottom of the chamber, and an
array of wickedly spiked stakes are planted upright in the ground.  The dirt
seems piled enough to allow exit upwards, but no other egress is visible.
