#DESCRIPTION What stands here appears to have once been a deer, the general shape of
the body and its relatively untouched legs attesting to this.  Much of the
flesh of the thing is gone now, however, replaced by thin, ropy tentacles. 
Some of the whiplike tendrils, their color a sickly purplish-grey, bind
tight about the stricken creature, while others flail mindlessly.  While the
majority of the members end in nothing or are hidden altogether in the
tangle of flesh, odd tentacles are tipped with snapping jaws or yellow,
alien eyes.

#DESCRIPTION A massive, ancient specimen of the srorsian race, this brown scaled
lizard rests in its cave.  Four massive, stumpy legs support a bulky body,
its back arching into the air.  In comparison to the rest of its body, its
head is relatively small.  A pair of dull, black eyes gaze from sockets,
betraying nothing beyond an animal intelligence.  Razor teeth fill its small
mouth, more for the catching of small animals and the eating of grass than
anything else.  A thick tail tapers from its body, nearly ten feet in
length.  The docile beast looks unalertly about its cavern, blinking its
black eyes on occasion.

of reeking filth, the odor foul, almost overpowering at times.  

The beast sloshes about wildly in the pool, its chittering rising in

a small gully.  Solid granite composes the path for the most part, but
jagged rocks are strewn about the trail, making travel on foot treacherous
at best.  The trail rises to the west, leading deeper into the Mlejian
mountains.

harsh, blasphemous runes surrounding it.  The walls of the chamber are
undecorated and unmarked, a wide hall, leading west, provides an exit.  
The air here seems still and cold.
