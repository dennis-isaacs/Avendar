#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Excerpt from "The History of the Mind", by Kisjam the Elder
 
**
Historically, the powers of the mind have been as rare as they are 
far reaching. No systematic study of such powers even existed before
the writings of a caladaran known as Andrajisk. 
Andrajisk was a monk of an obscure caladaran order, who became 
interested in the meditative fighting style of the swordmasters.
At the same time, he was deeply influenced by the philosophy of
his monastic order, which held that the world was illusion, and
the only primary reality was the mind. Forced to recognize the 
philosophical implications of the discipline of akan'ginta, he
formulated a synthesis of the two viewpoints, founding the 
discipline of ginta'cham'akan -- "Thought creating form", or
rendered into the common speech, psionics. 
Andrajisk began an exhaustive study of techniques of mental
disciplines all over Avendar -- learning from swordmasters 
their mastery of pattern, and adding to it his own innate 
insight into focusing his own thought to a keen perfection.
After years of exhaustive study, he was able to demonstrate
the arts he had mastered.
Andrajisk could peer into the minds of others, reading the
thoughts that skittered across the surface of the minds. He could
manipulate his own metabolism through altering his own mental
state, rendering himself immune to pain, or capable of standing
toe to toe with normal warriors. He could suggest commands to
the weak-minded, protect his own mind from mental attacks, or
even expose others to their own worse fears. He could look dimly
into the far future, or plainly into the immediate future, allowing
him a foresight that rivaled the ancient prophets. And, with great
effort, he found he could telekinetically manipulate the physical
world, dramatically confirming his own philosophy of the primacy
of mind. 
He began to teach his discipline in his own monastery, and word
of it began to spread, until it came to the attention of the scholar's
conclaves of Earendam, and the other great cities. At first his 
abilities were denounced as a fraud, and later, he was dismissed
as a scholar. With time, though, his teachings proliferated, and
the verdict of time has revealed that Andrajisk has not discovered
a new form of magic at all -- instead, a naturalistic phenomena,
emanating from the powers of the mind.
