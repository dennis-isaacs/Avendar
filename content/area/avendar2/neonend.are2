A long black cloak flows down her back, its surfaces stitched with the
Vhenerin Web of the Ashta Harrud Guild of the Void.  Over her silken
clothes, plates of black steel protect her body, the metal dull and
unreflective.  Upon her hands she wears a pair of delicate midnight gloves
trimmed in white fur.  Her clothing seems unnaturally clean, not a speck of
dust or hair mars them.

From between the ornate crossguards, a length of dull black energy springs. 
The inky, lightless length formed from the very stuff of the void itself. 
An unnatural chill emanates from the blade, as it sucks the very life from
the air around it, satiating it's dark hunger.

#DESCRIPTION Chapter One: The Dark Pond- The Void Ripple Theory.  

It has been surmised that the channeling of the void for the purpose of
casting creates ripples within the space of the void.  While many of the
lesser castings, simple maledictions and calls for knowledge, cause
insignificant disturbances, other more powerful incantations create
noticable ripples.  

For the most part, these ripples have little effect upon our craft.  It
raises interesting possibilities, however.  If this proves true, it may
allow for the detection of other spells cast by fellow void scholars.  Some
have said that the true reason for the harmful effects of the spells of
'gate', 'nexus' and 'phase door' are due to the disturbance caused by the
ripples of the casting.  I suspect this to be untrue, however.  The effects
of remaining within the void upon living matter would most likely be
detrimental.  There have been reports of people cast into the void while
under magical observation.  The subjects were reported to suffer no ill
physical results, but began to gibber madly.  They soon began to repeat some
incomprehensible phrase in desperation before they were apparently unmade. 
The claim that no physical harm was incurred is interesting.  Perhaps
survival within the Void would be possible, if the mental degeneration could
be avoided.  

The chapter continues, putting forth ideas on survival within the void.

#KEYWORDS  2
#DESCRIPTION Chapter Two: Demonic Resonance- Could Demonic Summoning be Refined?  

It is theorized that certain ripples resonate with the inhabitants of the
void.  The incantation sends out a ripple that beckons demons to enter this
realm.  The apparent randomness of demonic summoning suggests that these
demons are all clustered approximately the same distance away from the viel.
One wonders what may lie beyond the simple demons we now call.  Perhaps if
were able to somehow delay the effects of the ripples, or make them
undetectable to certain beings within the Void, we could find greater powers
to bind and call forces with more accuracy 

The summoning of Greater Demons is perhaps an example of this.  Have we
incidentally hit upon a way to slip the resonating ripples past the weaker
powers of the void?  If we have, how deep do we penetrate?  Are we ignoring
other demons between the lesser and the greater?  Many questions are raised.
With the refining of the summoning process, answers might be found.  

The chapter continues, giving forth proposals to streamline the summoning
process.

#DESCRIPTION Chapter Three: Black Swells- The Result of Ripple Interference.  

There have occasionally been reports of abberent results to rituals and
spells involving the void.  While many are the results of inept handling of
compenents or mispronounciation of an incantation, several incidents can not
be so simply explained away.  It is believed that when several powerful
ripples meet, it can cause a turbulance of sorts within the void, to
oft-unpleasant results.  Many cases of mispossesion and missummonings have
been credited to such.  Incidents of void scholars being stuck within the
other body and negation of personality are discussed in length in a treatsie
by one of my contemperaries, Rzkakiz.  

Missummonings are noteably less common, but usually more dramatic.  Jyraka,
a high wizard of the Yithoul tribe, reportedly attempted to summon a runaway
slave back to the temple.  Despite a reportedly flawless circle, the spell
went awry.  The result was the chaja being summoned into her body, the two
merging into a formless mass.  The resulting dissection showed the bodies
had indeed fused.  At the time, no less than 3 nexuses had been opened
around the cavern.  

The chapter continues, giving many more gruesome examples of failed
summonings.

#DESCRIPTION You are in a musty storeroom.  A fine layer of dust is settled upon the
wooden floor and the many barrels about the room.  Chiseled stone walls rise
about you, with no apparent way out.  A single flickering lightbulb
illuminates the labels upon the barrels.  You are able to make out 'Druids',
'Deer', 'Wolves' and 'Dragons' painted in black over the tops of the wooden
kegs.  Quiet scratching seems to come from within the barrels as if
something shifts inside them.

rope for making snares.  Tents and lean-tos dot the clearing, occupied by
wearied hunters.  A game trail is visible through the southern underbrush
and a shed stands to the north.  A blazing fire is visible in the center of

you.  The forest is dark now.  Very little light penetrates through the
canopy of leaves.  The branches about you seem to reach out for something,
their forms twisted as if in agony.  The ground beneath you looks damp and
mossy, becoming moreso to the south.  The stench of decay is heavy in the
air, the smell almost overpowering.

#NAME An Earthen Pit
#DESCRIPTION Walls of soil rise around you, the roots of trees poking through them.  A
faint glimmer of light comes from the hole above you, providing dim
illumination of the pit.  The walls are covered in claw marks, suggesting
that this place was burrowed rather than formed by nature.  Skeletons line
the floor, their bones smashed and scattered.  Despite the poor condition of
them, you can identify many of the corpses' owners.  The remains of deer,
bear and even humans are strewn about.  An animal stench lies heavy in the
stale air and a tunnel leads southward.

the soft rustle of the leaves in the breeze.  From your perch you can see
the walls of Var Bandor to the north.  To the southeast, Mount Enrien

#NAME A Dark Forest
#DESCRIPTION The forest continues all about, almost seeming to entwine itself behind
you.  The forest is dark now.  Very little light penetrates through the
canopy of leaves.  The branches about you seem to reach out for something,
their forms twisted as if in agony.  The ground beneath you looks damp and
mossy.  The stench of decay is heavy in the air, the smell almost
overpowering.  A high cliff rises up to the south, a narrow crevice
providing passage through it.

#NAME Rveyelhi Helpfile Room
#DESCRIPTION Rveyelhi, a once-mortal shuddeni Guardian, is a servitor diety of Iandir.
He currently oversees the house of Guardian in Iandir's stead while the
greater diety tends to other planes and worlds.  

A brutally efficient guardsman in mortality, Rveyelhi endorses a similarly
strict manner of dealing with criminals.  Followers of Rveyelhi believe that
those who would break the law are little more than rabid animals clawing at
the tapestry of civilization.  These beasts are to be put down, lest their
scratching unweave it.  Law breakers, as well as anyone else who would bring
chaos to the world, are to be dealt with by any means within the bounds of
law and with no mercy.  

Followers of Rveyelhi found worthy are branded with the Sigil of the Black
Staff.
