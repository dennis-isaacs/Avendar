#ALIGN 0 0
#DESCRIPTION The shade of Tessolos floats listlessly, his pale form a mere inches
above the ground.  Despite the absolute absence of color, an intricate
pattern of pale lights and darks trace out his features.  

A mane of wild ghostly hair frames his sepulchral features, wildly askew
like the mane of a lion or a poet's.  His large, blunt nose is framed above
by thick, long eyebrows, and below with a drooping moustache.  

Most striking, though, is his gaze.  Still gripped by the passions of his
life, his eyes are easily the most solid part of this shade, smoky black
orbs which stare relentlessly out at his surroundings.  

Breaking the intensity of his stare are long lines which crisscross his
face, marking his stern demeanor with visible marks of agony and sorrow.  

The shade wears a set of battle armor, over which is draped a garment closer
to a shroud than a tunic.  Inscribed in its tunic is a black triangle, with
an open eye squarely in its center.

clothing appears quite expensive, and the rich fabrics adorning his body are
spotless.  Strangely, however, continued examination seems to reveal the
fading remnants of two large bruises.

stone bricks.  The air is somewhat stale, and thick, supporting pillars
suggest that this place is far underground.  In the center of the room, a
tall block of dark stone stands freely.  Carved into the stone are deep, red
lines, which trace out a mystical hieroglyph.  The room lacks any other
furnishing or exit, leaving the dark stone as the room's only noteworthy
contents.

slightly at the temples and is shot through with streaks of silver.  Not a
comely woman, Eninia has often been criticized for her devious machinations
among the complex Earendam political scene, applying her racial wisdom in a
most un-caladaran-like manner with ruthless efficiency.  A persona of
formidable capabilities, she has risen to the position of Master Alchemist
through both her abilties and her connections.

#DESCRIPTION On the Character of the Planar Beings of Earth:
 
As is well known, the scholars of earth have used
servants from that elemental plane since the 
dawning of their art. According to myth, elementals
were even used in the construction of parts of the old 
city, helping to build the city's walls when labor grew
scarce.
 
Little has been written about the nature of the common
elemental, however, and I have written this text to 
make a general study of the subject. 
 
Now, unlike those who dabble in the void, we do not 
call our elemental servants unwillingly into the 
prime material, nor do we threaten or bribe them. 
Rather, most elementals of earth actually crave the 
unfamiliar taste of matter in the prime material, and 
enjoy helping scholars create new structures of
matter, or rearrange existing structures.
 
This taste for exotic matter is possible because 
elementals as such do not transfer their physical 
matter from the plane of earth -- to do so would require
opening a stable gateway to that plane, which would 
require far more concentration and mana expenditure.
 
Rather, when an elemental is summoned, the animus, 
or animating spirit of an elemental is conjured, and 
they inhabit a shell of matter in the prime material. Of
course, the power and versatility of the spirit called 
will depend on the proximity of the caster to the plane
of earth. It is well known that elementals conjured in
caves or fissures have greater strength, resulting in 
this property.
 
 

The rest of the text concerns technical matters, 
including various tests of hardness and magical 
strength.

#DESCRIPTION An excerpt from "A History of Earendam the Grand: Portrait of a City and
its Times.."  

By Jofis Tabr, historian and scholar

The fortunes of Earendam in the centuries following the War of Night would
bring it from Republic to city-state, from feared to contented, and from
mythic to legendary.  And yet, despite its decline in fortunes, this city
was and continues to remain the heart of human culture in Avendar.  

Purported to have been founded after the War of Fire, it is certainly the
oldest known city founded by humans.  Beginning as a fishing village built
on the banks of the Dantaron, and near the shores of the Uthlin, Earendam
had long been a center for trade and council among primitive men, even
before the War of Fire.  

After the war, the human templars and sorcerers who had lead their people
against the aelin met with death and exiles.  The vast majority of humanity,
tired of war and conflict, settled with relative ease under the leadership
of the likes of Aramril and Salyra.  

Earendam's rise to power is not the subject of this treatise, but it is
sufficient to know that those who associated with the ancient banner of the
blue and white rose brought with them more than force of arms, or powerful
magic.  With them rode the tide of culture, and the force of its coming
changed the face of Avendar.  

By the time of the War of Night, the Republic embraced most of the main
continent of Avendar, with ties to the mountain strongholds of the aelin,
and the more primitive ethron.  Moralists among the priests of Jolinn and
Iandir decried the onset of decadence in the people and the government of
Earendam.  With most frontiers closed, the eyes of Earendam turned inward,
desperately seeking some novelty, some new thing, to come from within.  

At the war's end, some predicted a new golden age for the Republic,
supported by the new magics of spirits and united by the threat of the
shuddeni.  Few counted on these very factors forming the foundation for the
fall of the Republic.  

The new magics used in the War of Night had a deeper influence on the
culture of the Republic than might have been expected.  It was not a matter
of citizens summoning demons or speaking to dead relatives, but rather the
more subtle powers of the magic that began the process.  The simpler magics
of void allowed for easy travel across vast distances, as well as the
similar powers of the scholars of spirit.  Knowledge traveled quickly and
easily between cities, and fractious and dissident thought proliferated. 
When the magics of air came into the second century, traditional trading
practices also were turned on their head, with a proliferation of free-lance
traders and handler of goods.  

At the same time, the threat of the shuddeni actually served to increase
factionalism in the Republic.  Different city-states offered varying
proposals for dealing with their defeated enemies.  Most supported some
variety of a containment policy, but more radical opinions ranged from
conciliation (often heard from those cities occupied by the shuddeni) to a
campaign of extermination (as advocated by extreme elements in the clergy of
Jolinn).  The political divisions over the "shuddeni" problem lead to
Earendam being forced to garrison fortresses such as Kor Thrandir with their
own troops and supplies, greatly weakening an already diminished military. 


This period of decline continued until circa three centuries ago, when a ten
year period of long winters and poor harvests intensified political unrest
in the Republic to the breaking point.  Provinces in the south began to
revolt, refusing to supply the already overpopulated Earendam with the
tribute and food it desperately needed.  In the north, a new breed of
kankorans had migrated from across the Uthlin, lead by fierce far leaders
and fighting with a fanatical desperation.  Trade disputes with Var Bandor
further alienated Earendam from the western provinces, and turmoil over the
open worship of the dark gods caused a furor in Earendam itself.  

When the kankorans began a long and bloody series of campaigns in the
northlands, Earendam's military proved unable to satisfactorily deal with
the menace.  Caught unprepared, and lead by generals who had never had
actual experience in battle.  Caught in the itinerant raids lead by
barbarian warlords, Earendam's army was defeated in a long series of bloody
battles, and driven back to the walls of the city itself.  

In what is most likely the low point of Earendam's history, most of the
ruling Senate fled the city, fearing for their own lives.  The citizens
rallied under the leadership of a man named Corvandil Novis, head of one of
the city's oldest noble houses.  While the ensuing battle ravaged the
northern half of Earendam, the battle put an end to the kankoran presence in
the area for the next two hundred years.  

In the aftermath of what became known as the First Kankoran War, Earendam
was forced out of political necessity to cede its claim to the far reaching
provinces of the Republic, and the leadership of the city passed from the
Senate (now in disgrace) to a ruling Patrician, which became a lifetime
leader selected from among the city's nobility.  

For those that balk at the thought of the social institutions of a Republic
changing so thoroughly, let us not forget the stresses Earendam faced, and
the fact that the institution of the Patrician mimicked the long- standing
familial order of the city-dwellers, where a single rich noblemen would
support many by his largesse.  For these reasons, some have gone beyond the
claim that the office was born of necessity, but rather, the role of the
Patrician was a cultural inevitability.  

Despite these changes, the unified voice that the Patrician brought to
Earendam's politics lead to an unprecedented growth.  The north side of the
city was rebuilt, in part using the magics of earth, and changes in the laws
regarded trade resulting in a small merchant class flourishing.  Artisans
and scholars once more came to Earendam, viewing it once more as a bastion
of culture.  [In this humble author's opinion, Var Bandorian scholars choose
to live in a cesspool].

#DESCRIPTION This bracelet is named after its central feature, three stones imbedded
in its gold band.  In the center, there is a large sapphire.  To the left of
the sapphire is a rectangular aquamarine, and to the right of it a rounded
blue opal.  

The tristone bracelet is a healing artifact, constructed using the magics of
water and the natural affinities of the three gemstones used in its
costruction.  

Legend has it that this pattern of three in one can be traced to the ancient
alatharya's pattern of magic, but no such evidence exists.  

To unlock its magic, simply 'invoke' the type of gem you wish to draw on, or
'invoke tristone' to tap its full power.  Be warned, for its use is limited,
its power having faded over time.

used are not known, being among the countless treasures of lore lost in the
sundering.  Nonetheless, archmages post-sundering have discovered one manner
of ingress into the border regions of the plane of air.  
  
The method of entering these regions was found quite by accident.  Two air
archmages, Crouble and Gralci, were testing the effects of bringing various
substances of air and earth into conflict.  On a whim, Gralci used an
enchanted dagger of electrum upon a djinni.  When the djinni's death-blow
was dealt, a highly unusual funnel was formed.  As the funnel lasts only the
briefest of moments, it took another several years of reproducing and
studying the phenomenon to discover that it may serve (should one be quick
enough to enter) as a portal.  
  
The regions into which the funnel leads are the near-intersections of the
plane of air and the prime material.  They are chaotic realms of air,
vapors, gases, and mists, lorded over by mighty djinn caliphs.  Mortals will
find their senses at a loss, as without physical landmarks, compass
directions in the chaotic expanse are all but meaningless.  Denizens of the
plane fly about, and are, with a few exceptions, quite hostile to mortal
visitors.  Vortexes of poisonous gas and noxious vapors are also extremely
dangerous, if not immediately fatal.  Meandering currents snake throughout
the region, perhaps serving as roads of sorts to the dwellers of the plane. 
Of the three principle currents, the fierce, the unsteady, and the turbulent,
it is said that only those following the turbulent current have returned 
alive to the prime material.

#DESCRIPTION On the Base Material Essence

One of the first lessons for an apprentice on the path
is that of material, for this is the basic foundation
of essence.  Each material has its own property in the
inner circle and without. They who have walked the path
of mastery will know.

Rarity is not power, but rather substance is virtue.
Each material must be considered in its own right, for
while assumptions can be made, exceptions will rule.
The seeing eye will soon find where the materials lie
on the circles.

Of animal there is flesh, blood, bone, fur, chitin,
feather, carrion, dragonbone, dragonhide, dragonscale,
hide, ivory, leather, and scale.

Of plant there is plant, herb, ebony, ironwood, oak, 
maple, tobacco, and wood.

Of mineral there is amber, amethyst, aquamarine, bloodstone,
crystal, diamond, dirt, earth, emerald, jade, obsidian,
onyx, opal, pearl, ruby, sapphire, stone, and topaz. 

Of metal there is brass, bronze, copper, electrum, gold, 
iron, metal, lead, mei'tzec, mercury, platinum, silver, 
steel, and tin.

Of product, cloth, lace, silk, ribbon, velvet, parchment,
wax, food, alcohol, spice, medicine, poison, powder, 
glass, gem, and extract.

Of elemental substance, there is water, ice, fire, smoke,
air, acid, ch'lonin, shadow, and energy.

#DESCRIPTION Aquisitions of Alchemical Power
by Parcaldia
  
You who are skilled in alchemy, and as many others as promise
yourselves great riches or chiefly desire to make gold and 
silver through your efforts, which Alchemy in different ways
promises and teaches, and equally, too, you who willingly 
undergo toil and vexations, and wish not to be freed from them,
until  you have attained your rewards, and the fulfilment of
the  promises made to you; experience teaches this every day,
that out of thousands of you not even one accomplishes his
desire. Is this a failure of nature or of the art? I say, no--
but it is  rather the fault of fate, or of the unskilfulness
of the student.
   
Since, therefore, the characters of the sign of element and
power, together with the essence, recipes, materials, and
form are thoroughly well known to such as are acquainted with
this art, it would be altogether superfluous to recur to these
same subjects in the present text, although the use of such at
the proper time is by no means without advantage.
   
This, indeed, will not give scope for a pompous parade of words,
but, nevertheless, in the consideration of those immutable laws
everything which should be separated from Alchemy will be 
kept at sufficient length, and, moreover, many secrets of other 
things will be obtained. Hence, too, result certain marvellous
speculations and new operations which frequently differ from
the writings and opinions of ancient scholars and sages, but have
been discovered and confirmed by full proof and experimentation.
   
Moreover, in this art nothing is more true than this, though it 
be little known and gains small confidence. All the fault and cause
of difficulty in alchemy, whereby very many persons are reduced to
poverty, and others labour in vain, is wholly and solely lack of
skill in the student, and the defect or excess of materials, 
whether in quantity or quality, form or type, whence it ensues that,
in the course of operation, things are wasted or reduced to nothing.
   
If the true process shall have been found, the substance itself 
while transmuting approaches daily more and more towards perfection.
The straight road is easy, but it is found by very few.

#DESCRIPTION The Advisings of Elchin
 He Being of the First of the Disciples of Urbergeron,
 and One Who Has Walked Fully down the Path of Mastery
   
Now I do not wonder, as I did before, why philosophers of the art,
having attained knowledge by experience in full, have not cared to
have their days shortened (although by the virtue of their work they
could have prolonged them) for every true philosopher has all so
clearly set before his eyes, as your face is seen in a glass. Thus
much by way of reply to the frivolous objections of those that
believe not the verity of this art, who hold arcane word and gesture
to be superior to true substance. If you should discover to them the 
process of the common alchemic stone, let alone that great prize
long sought by many, they would laugh at your simplicity, and I
will warrant you never make use of it. Nay, if you should animate
the substance before them, they would think that even in that there
was a fallacy, so wedded to their scholarship of unbelief they are.
So I find them, and so I leave them, and shall forever find them
the same. And although some students of the art, possessed with 
foolish notions, dream that the true matter is to be found only in
some  particular places, at such and such times of the year; yet we
are most certain (according to our master Urbergeron) that, all these
suppositions being false, it is to be found everywhere, at all
times, according to our lore and for our application. For in the
vision of Urbergeron, he saw an empty void of shadow, seperated from
the not-void only by a halo of spirit. Then came powers, of the
Ancient to Transmogrify, and so was wrought according to the will,
between shadow and light, the fundamental matters and energies of
Earth, Fire, Water, and Air (which, with life begun in Spirit and 
gnawed to consumption by Void, are Nature). And the powers utilized
and wrought are essence first, essence of element, essence of truest
being, with which all things resonate in degree according to their
very material stuff and according to the shaping of type. And so
there are nine of fundamental element, and nine is the chief and most
foremost number in the lore of he who would know. He who sees, of the
study and teaching of Urbergeron, can sense their influence in all.
Yet whosoever shall presume to obtain the height of this art, 
according to our most secret ways without the observing and 
understanding of Urbergeron, will certainly find himself mightily 
mistaken at last, having after a great deal of troubles, charges, 
and pains, reaped nothing but discontent; and on the contrary they,
that shall walk in our true and infallible lore, shall with very little
trouble and expenses attain their desired end, which we cordially
wish to all those who are sincere well-wishers to the alchemic 
philosophy. But the true student looks beyond the first essence of 
element to see all other aspects and virtue, vice and design which touch
the foundation of property. These number many and are known to none but 
the minds of those who command the ancient by will, and of their 
influence, are as lasting as the nine. And there is Alteration for 
Enhancement. And there is Detection from Beguilement. And there is 
Travel in the bounds of the Planar. And there is Healing of Damage. And
there is Benediction against Malediction. And there is Revelation from 
Obscurement. And there is Chaos against Order. And there is Protection
from Weather. And there is Knowledge from Mental. And there is Summoning
for Conjuration. And there is Breath of Time. And these in aspect shape
the making even as the element stands at the crux of essence to bring
about what the hands of the philosopher shall fashion. And this work of
the essence from its very beginning to its perfect end may, on our 
certain knowledge, be so perfected by any skillful and careful artist,
that knows the lore of Urbergeron, unless some accident should happen
in the preparation of our great works: which to prevent, we wrought 
them with care, and for better effect in a place of sufficient design
and material which is most agreeable to the practice of the wisest of
philosophers.

#DESCRIPTION THE CODE OF THE KNIGHTS OF ENAERAI

The Knights of Enaerai seek to uphold the balance in Avendar.  By persuasion
or by force, and acting as a unified military body, the Knights are ever
vigilant that no extreme influence disrupts the equilibrium and natural
balance as created when the three great powers first brought Avendar into
being.  

The Knights revere Enaerai, who is held as their guiding deity of balance,
though no active worship is required throughout the Order.  They also
observe Mettenday, the first calendar day of every month on the standard
Avendarian calendar, as a day of rest, recuperation, and assembly.  No
efforts to actively enforce balance are made by the Knights on Mettenday. 
The Knights are based in the city of Earendam, in a compound adjunct to the
Temple of Enaerai.  

REQUIREMENTS OF KNIGHTHOOD

Adventurers who are neutral in both alignment and ethos may become Knights
of Enaerai.  However, scholars who practice the greater spells of spirit or
void, and templars of those spheres, may not seek entrance to the
Knighthood.  To join the Knights of Enaerai, seek out members of the order
and petition them for entrance.  Knights may be recognized by the symbol of
Enaerai--the eye within a triangle.  

THE OFFICES OF KNIGHTHOOD

The organization of the Knighthood is straightforward, run with the
efficiency and manner one would expect of a military order.  Knights heed
the directions of their superiors without question, sacrificing life and
even soul to the cause.  

The Knight Lord leads the Knights.  He or she is the highest officer and
supreme commander of the Knights, maintaining the order of the knighthood
and directing them in actions to right the balance.  

There are up to three captains of the Knights, who vote for the new Lord
should the office be absent.  Each is also given the leadership of the Mett,
Idris, or Ilthar divisions of the Knights.  

The Captain of Mett is charged with subterfuge, spying, scouting, and
providing necessary reconnaissance, as well as leading the rogue component
and other miscellaneous forces of the Knight body.  

The Captain of Idris pools and compiles knowledge regarding adventurers in
the land and their effects on the balance, and the balance between houses,
as well as leading the magical or scholarly forces of the Knight body.  

The Captain of Ilthar is charged with being the second, under the Knight
Lord, to direct in battle, to administer punishment of final death to
renegade Knights who have broaken their oaths of Knighthood, and to lead the
warrior forces of the Knight body.

#DESCRIPTION THE PRIEST OF ENAERAI

In the temple of Enaerai in Earendam, a priest tends the altar.  He will
also occasionally grant his blessings and spells upon Knights who are in the
temple.  

Like most temple priests, he can heal for a price, but he'll also grant
benedictions and heal wounds for Knights, of his own accord, and when his
duties permit.  

The priest will also hold items for the Knights, though he will drop
artifacts of great power (such as the Stones of Power) as such items have
the potential to influence the balance and should not be in the temple.  

If a Knight wishes to request the last item given to the priest, the Knight
may do the following: 

request

Finally, when a Knight prays in the presence of the priest in the temple,
the Knight will be able to discern whether Enaerai is near to the realm of
mortals and the prayer is heard, or whether she is distant.  If she is
distant, the priest will take note of the prayer, and Enaerai will receive
the prayer at a later time, when she once more draws near to the mortal
realm.

#DESCRIPTION THE KNIGHT GUARD

In the temple of Enaerai, a Knight stands guard at the doors of the
compound.  He will permit only Knights to pass the doors, and those the
Knights wish to invite within the compound.  If Knights wish to invite
someone into the compound, they may say the following: 

escort <name>

The guard will alert all Knights when others attempt to force their way into
the compound, and will also attack renegades of the Knighthood on sight.

#DESCRIPTION ADMINISTERING THE KNIGHT OATH

The worthy applicant traditionally stands in the gold ring before the Knight
Lord (or Captain, in the Lord's absence).  The applicant is questioned
regarding their desire to take the oath, whether it is done of their own
volition, and whether they understand the consequenses of breaking the oath.


If the applicant gives satisfactory answers, the adminstrator of the oath
questions: "Will you take the oath upon yourself now?"  The applicant must
respond "I will" (and should be informed beforehand that those are the
proper ceremonial words, without which the oath stone will not bind the
oath).  

This done, the administrator of the oath uses the oath stone in the
following manner: 

oath knight <name>

#DESCRIPTION ADMINISTERING THE CAPTAIN OATH

Traditionally, the candidate for the captaincy stands in the gold ring
before the Knight Lord (or another Captain, in the Lord's absence).  The
candidate is formally charged with directing and upholding the work of the
division they are to direct.  The administrator then questions: "Will you
pledge to faithfully serve Enaerai and the balance as Knight Captain?"  The
candidate must respond "I will" (and should be informed beforehand that
those are the requisite ceremonial words that must be uttered, for the oath
stone to bind the ceremony).  

This done, the administrator of the oath uses the oath stone in the

#DESCRIPTION ADMINISTERING THE LORD OATH

At least two Knight Captains must agree on the candidate for the Knight
Lord position, and the prospective Knight Lord given the oath by another
Captain, for the oath ceremony and granting of rank to be considered 
valid before Enaerai.

As with the other oath ceremonies, the candidate stands in the gold ring,
before a Knight Captain.  The candidate is formally charged with directing
the Knighthood and taking responsibility for the balance of Avendar before
Enaerai.  The Captain then questions: "Will you accept this charge?" 
The candidate must respond "I will" (and should be informed beforehand that
those are the necessary words to be uttered, for the oath stone to bind the
ceremony).

This done, the administrator of the oath uses the oath stone in the
following manner:

oath lord <name>

#DESCRIPTION DEMOTING AN OFFICER OF THE KNIGHTS

For whatever reason, if a leader among the Knights is to be demoted or
returned to standard Knight status, the administrator, before the oath
stone, asks the Knight whether they accept the removal of office.  The
Knight must respond "I accept" (and should be so informed), and then the
administrator binds the act through use of the oath stone, as follows:

oath knight <name>

#DESCRIPTION NAMING A RENEGADE KNIGHT

Only the Knight Lord may declare a Knight to be renegade and oathbreaker. 
Normally, Knights accused of oathbreaking are given warning and an
opportunity to defend themselves (in a simple court, as directed by the
Lord).  The naming of renegade is a last resort, to declare to the Knight
that their mortal life, which is sworn to Enaerai, is forfeit.  When a
Knight is judged to be renegade, and is present in the realm, the Knight
Lord uses the oathstone in the following manner: 

renegade <name>

#DESCRIPTION USE OF THE SCALE OF ORLIN

The Knight Lord is given charge to care for and instruct Knights in the use
of the Scale of Orlin.  The Scale of Orlin is a complex instrument, only
understood by those dedicated to Enaerai and in the knight order.  It
measures the balance between good and evil, between law and chaos, and
between the strength of the houses.  It gives priority to the measure in
that order, as should the Knights.  The scale is used in the following
manner:

#DESCRIPTION THE SIGIL OF ENAERAI


Knights receive the sigil of Enaerai, a mark depicting the Eye of
Enaerai symbol, when they first take the oath of Knighthood upon
themselves.  For some, particularly those Knights who would find
themselves within the division of the Mett, the sigil may not be
visible, but exists nonetheless.

The sigil grants Knights a small measure of protection from holy and
negative powers, as well as a slight increase of combat abilities.
It also assists in communications among the Knight Order.  Knights
may speak to each other in the following manner:

 knighttell <message>  or kt <message>

Those who wear the sigil can also address a note to all Knights by 
doing the follwing:

#DESCRIPTION On Restoring the Balance
by High Lord Tessolos

  "The Knights of Enaerai seek to uphold the balance in
   Avendar.  By persuasion or by force, and acting as a
   unified military body, the Knights are ever vigilant
   that no extreme influence disrupts the equilibrium
   and natural balance as created when the three great
   powers first brought Avendar into being."

When the balance is in jeopardy, what action must Knights take? The lines
above, penned into the Code by Orlin the Founder, serve as a guide.
Knights present in the realm, under the direction of any leaders also
present, together are sworn to act against the imbalance and set it aright.

It is known that the wandering guild adventurers offer the greatest
potential for destabilizing (and rectifying) the balance.  And so it is
primarily upon the adventurers of Avendar that the Knights must focus
their attention, doing all in their power to drive forth those who disrupt
balance, and to encourage and strengthen the lesser side of the scale.

In some cases, persuasion suffices--those who would remain friendly the
Knight Order may choose to depart rather than be driven by force.  Many
a time bloodshed may be avoided through discussion, or making other
sorts of arrangements or agreements (with those who would hold true to
such agreements) that also bring the scales back into proper harmony.

But more often, force is required, and thus we are organized into a
military body, to maximize effiency in that regard.  Those who resist
the efforts of Knights, to depart the land or face the blades and spells
of the Knight Order, choose for themselves.  It is known that the ghosts
of mortals weight but little, if at all, upon the scales, and so the 
duty of the  Knights is clear with regard to force.

That is not to say that a Knight is required to suicide against a
superior force, for that would not accomplish the goals of the order, 
and is foolishness.  But in such a situation, the Knight would of 
course be actively working, strategizing, and doing everything within
his or her power to strengthen the force or element opposing the imbalance,
and preparing himself or herself to be able meet the imbalance 
with sufficient force to drive it from the land.

Knights who see no easy way to rectify the balance, and then turn to
their own needs and desires--guild advancement, seeking honors, glory,
or gold and items of power--dishonor their vows, unless such actions
will clearly and directly aid them in preparing for and battling
the superior force.

I have known of Knights who have, with the balance in jeopardy, 
gone upon their way, working toward guild advancement and 
otherwise neglecting to give heed to the work of restoration.
Such faithless and callow fools all eventually wind up the same--as
oathbreakers, outcasts of the order, and hunted by the true
servants of balance.

Here is set forth, in concise format, the major influences of every formally 
recognised artistic period of Avendarian history. The reader will, I trust, 
forgive my somewhat dry and direct discourse in this presentation. My 
intention is to provide a work of reference, rather than a subjective 
commentary of the field - for such a treatise, the reader is encouraged to 
refer to the author's autobiography: 

     "A Stroke of Genius" - being an exposition of the life of renowned
      artist, critic and art historian, Engleham Wellingsley III

                 The Periods of Avendarian Art

The listed races for each art period are those who principally created and 
participated in that period, and is by no means exclusive. Artists of every 
race were to be found to participate in many styles, even if their final 
contributions to the developement of that period was limited. 

Little is known about the historical developement of shuddeni art, as it did 
not appear on the surface until just previous to and during the War of Night. 
The modern alatharya tend not to engage in artistic pursuits, beyond the 
crudest adaptions of primitive styles, so they are not listed beyond their 
first mention.

- Kankoran

NOTE: From the Kankoran phrase "Jaraan-Baarr", which means outside of ones 
self, indictating an awareness of the powers around one.

                 ----------------------------------

Pious
- Work on board, canvas, and relief
- Extremely detailed
- Still very posed and formal
- Developement of Aelin symbolism
- Aelin, Human

                 ----------------------------------

Ciandr (common - beautynature)
- Carvings out of wood, both relief and free-standing
- Shapes and patterns are worked into wood or carved from it
- The goal was to bring forth nature's beauty without making it unnatural
- Ethron, Caladaran

                 ----------------------------------

High Detamnat (common - superstitious; known as "Stilnil" to Caladarans)
- Developed ceramic art, largely based on historical stories and events
- Rich glazes developed
- Experimentations in shape
- Caladaran

NOTE: When the word "Detamnat" is spoken, most will think of the developed 
caladaran ceramic art, instead of its actual beginnings in superstition. It 
no longer has any purpose besides ornamental telling of history.

                 ----------------------------------

Slirucasro (aelin - quintessence)
- Worked mostly on canvas, some sculpture
- Began to stray from religious topics
- Skill of the artist become more important
- Studies of still life and form very common
- Buildings again become more ornate
- Aelin, Human

                 ----------------------------------

Aelin Hisilan (aelin - revelry)
- Worked mostly on canvas, some sculpture
- Art begins to become a bit frivolous in the attention given to detail
- Part of the worth of the piece is how clever it is, how many subtle stories 
  or messages lie within it
- Aelin

                 ----------------------------------

Ashi Uzitha (shuddeni - beautiful darkness)
- Work on canvas, cloth, and some sculpture
- Brought from the shuddeni caves
- Typically dark scenes of horror and torture, but where it melds into a 
  beautiful composition
- Proportion was often extended or changed, to fit the piece compositionally
- Human, Shuddeni (mostly sculpture)

Krag Uzitha (shuddeni - living darkness)
- Work on canvas, cloth, and sculpture
- During the war many artists were commisioned to do works for the newly 
  conquered cities
- As during the Ashi Uzitha period, the works were of torture and suffering
- Aelin, Human, Shuddeni (sculpture mostly)

NOTE: Some Nefortu created works of Krag Uzitha, but mostly in tapestry. 
Many scholars don't consider the Nefortu work truly Krag Uzitha, but their 
content and the time usually puts them in this period.

There are two main differences between the Ashi Uzitha and Krag Uzitha 
periods:
- Krag Uzitha pieces are sometimes set outside, often during the day
- Krag Uzitha proportion is more regulated and realistic looking, owing to 
  the influence of the Aelin Hisilan period.

                 ----------------------------------

Celestial (Same time as the Th'cirre Mel period)
- Work on a variety of mediums
- Not as strictly realistic as in the Aelin Hisilan and Slirucasro periods, 
  more sketchy and fast
- Lighter colours, little shadow or darkness
- Content was spiritual and fantasic in nature
- Scenes of wonder and magic, or the enlightenment of self
- Ch'taren sometimes set alongside beings of myth or the gods themselves 
  (although no ch'taren artist is recorded to have represented their race as 
  divine)
- Aelin, Human, Ch'taren

                 ----------------------------------

Th'cirre Mel (ch'taren - common man)
- Work done on board, canvas, and cloth
- Bright colours
- Loosely realistic as in the Celestial period
- Clear shapes, little shading
- Content tends to be the common man, happy scenes of everyday life
- Human, Ch'taren

                 ----------------------------------

Late Jaranber
- Paintings on animal skins, tents, clothing
- Bold shapes and colours, more abstract in style than earlier kankoran art
- Used as decoration, but not as formal "art"
- Last signifigant advancement in Kankoran art
- Kankoran

                 ----------------------------------

Pastoral
- Work done on canvas and board
- People began to focus more on the outside world
- Content usually a landscape, sometimes done of villages and small towns
- Human, Ch'taren, Caladaran

                 ----------------------------------

Ulidsa (aelin - linear)
- Work done on canvas and board
- Focus changes from nature to the cities
- Strict rules of perspective and detail, very linear
- Again becomes more precise, less hazy
- Aelin, Human

                 ----------------------------------

Ayajli (nefortu - infinite)
- Work done in tapestry, weaving
- Focused on intricate infinite patterns within the tapestry instead of the 
  pictures and scenes of the past
- Wide variety of colours, with hundreds and thousands of threads in shades 
  of every used colour.
- Nefortu

                 ----------------------------------

Aeh Pastoral (aelin - beyond)
- Work done on canvas and board
- Somewhat of a backlash against the confined style of Ulidsa
- Return to outside world, though on a more grand scale than in Pastoral
- Most works of this period focus on the sky
- Landscape becomes insignifigant, takes up only 10-20% of the painting
- Aelin, Human, Ch'taren

Neopious
- Work done on canvas, board, sculpture, and some relief
- Again the focus turns to the heavens, though the style is more relaxed than 
  in the earlier Pious periods
- Stories told of gods and men, and spiritual pieces
- Aelin, Human, Ch'taren

                 ----------------------------------

High Th'cirre Mel
- Work done on board, canvas, cloth, and some sculpture
- Demands that focus be put on man and his emotions instead of the world 
  around him
- Bright colours
- Somewhat flat shapes with little shading
- Common man going about a happy day
- Often depicts scenes of taverns, games, picnics, and other lighthearted 
  activities
- Human, Ch'taren, Ethron

                 ----------------------------------

Oreinn (common - passion) - Current
- Work done on board, canvas, cloth, and some sculpture
- The same lighthearted feel as High Tel'cirre, though with even more 
  frivolous and sensual overtones
- Somewhat detailed, though there is still the loose feeling to the work 
  stemming back to the Celestial period
- Human, Ch'taren, Ethron

                 ----------------------------------

Pones (common - heaven) - Current
- Work done on board, canvas, sculpture, and relief
- Developement of Neopious goals, turning back towards the Aelin Hisilan 
  attention to detail
- The gods are portrayed in their many faces and stages, always with 
  reverence
- Aelin, Human, Caladaran

NOTE: The two schools of art currently are very divided.  They are essentially 
teaching two different moral schools; Love life versus love those who gave you 
life, though really they are not so different in the end.

         A Guide to the Principal Contributions of the Races

Aelin - Responsible for many leaps ahead in the understanding of form, partly 
due to their preserved knowledge from the ancient alatharya.

Alatharya - There are few alatharya artists. The level of artistic
developement of the ancient alatharya is poorly known, although the
few pieces remain suggest it to be considerable

Caladaran - Famed for their ceramic pottery, especially that from the High 
Detamnat period.

Ch'taren - Inspired the Celestial period, and a looser style of drawing.

Ethron - Known for exceptional carving skills.

Kankorans - Dyed and painted leather and animal skins, only notable art 
developement was in the Jaranber period.

Human - Have contributed to the largest range of styles and periods, for the 
most part after the War of Fire.

Nefortu - Contributions limited, but are known for their intricate patterned 
tapestries.

Shuddeni - Mutated proportions to make beautiful compositions, sculptural 
pieces and reliefs, concentrating on themes of horror.

Srryn - Mostly decorative clothing with teeth, skin, and scales. Little in 
the way of formal art.

#NAME Frinian Way
#DESCRIPTION Frinian Way is a broad but winding street which heads generally east and
west through New Earendam.  Scholars, artisans, and other craftsmen use this
street, bringing their goods from the east to the Arien Plaza, where they
can be peddled to the merchants that gather there.  The buildings lining
this street appear of more recent construction than the cobblestones of
Frinian, which show the marks of what could only be nigh on hundreds of
years of wear.  In contrast, the surrounding buildings, while hewn from the
Brintors, show signs of the shapings of magic.  In particular, a small tower
and base lies to the north of here, seemingly formed from the melting of
some liquid black stone.  Home to the enigmatic Brotherhood of the Golden
Flame, the tower seems active, but no entrance is apparent from this side of
the street.

#NAME North of Tyril Square
#DESCRIPTION The north part of Tyril square lies very near the gates of Earendam,
which lie to the north.  Past the gates are grasslands, and eventually the
Brintor mountains, which provide most of the source of Earendam's mineral
wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir. 
East and west, the corners of the square end in arched buildings, while a
central fountain dominates the square to the south.

Covered with a cobblestone of glazed brown bricks, the square stretches off
south and east, heading toward the north gates of town to the east, and a
central fountain to the southeast.  The occasional armed patrol lingers
around an arched portcullis to the west, usually coming from or going to the
north gates of the town.  Further south the square opens to the west,

#NAME Center of Tyril Square
#DESCRIPTION The center of Tyril square is dominated by a marble statue, serving as
the centerpiece for a concentric series of fountains.  Serving as the
junction for travel between Earendam's north gate, the mercantile quarter,
the artisan's district, and the occasional nobleman from Old Earendam across
the Dantaron, the square is nevertheless well-maintained, and covered with a
glazed brown cobblestone of Brintorean stone.  The main throughfares of the

legends surround Tyril, portraying him as marrying the daughters of a
Senator, and laying claim to a Barony far in the east.

#NAME East Tyril Way
#DESCRIPTION A well-tended cobblestone street, East Tyril Way runs east and west
through the artisan's district of Earendam.  Running parallel to the banks
of the Dantaron River to the south, East Tyril's traffic is a mixture of
various scholars and artisans, along with the occasional patron from the
more aristocratic parts of the city.  Here, a small turn in the road heads
south, where a high-arched stone bridge crosses the Dantaron.  Towering over
the north of the street, though, is a building which dwarfs even the expanse
of the stone bridge.  A marvel of design, the Glallian School is virtually
the archetype of classic Earendam architecture, and is complete with the
traditional marble staircase leading up to an arched entrance to the school.
The school continues to the east, skirted by East Tyril.

#NAME East Tyril Way
#DESCRIPTION A well-tended cobblestone street, East Tyril Way runs east and west
through the artisan's district of Earendam.  Running parallel to the banks
of the Dantaron River to the south, East Tyril's traffic is a mixture of
various scholars and artisans, along with the occasional patron from the
more aristocratic parts of the city passing over a stone bridge to the
southwest.  Towering over the north of the street is a building which dwarfs
even the expanse of the stone bridge.  A marvel of design, the Glallian
School is virtually the archetype of classic Earendam architecture, and is
complete with the traditional marble staircase leading up to an arched
entrance to the school.  Known as a center for the magics of earth, the
Glallian School seems formed from a single piece of the Brintor
mountainside, seemingly lacking the cracks and seams of other such large
buildings.  The school continues to the east, skirted by East Tyril.

#NAME End of Tyril Way
#DESCRIPTION Tyril Way comes to an end here, meeting the east wall of the city as it
terminates.  Southward, the Dantaron also flows east and west, but rather
than coming to an end at the city walls, passes through the an iron sluice
gate as it heads toward the Uthlin.  Tyril continues further west, following
the walls of the enormous building which dominates the riverside.  Towering
over the north of the street, the building is the Glallian School, known as
a center for the magics of earth.  In keeping with its ancient tradition, it
is built in the classical republican style of Earendam, complete with the
required marble staircase leading up to its arched entrance.  Hewn from the
brown stones of the Brintors, the lack of seams and cracks in the building
almost suggest a building made of one contiguous piece of mountainside.

districts.  Home to many of the artisans and scholars for which the city is
reknowned, Crescent Way is lined on both sides by many beautiful houses, all
built with an eye towards the aesthetic.  Tall, high columns adorn the more
traditional houses, built in the classical Republican style, but the
majority of the houses show the more recent handiwork of the shapings of the
magics of earth.  These houses tend to be less gaudy than their classical
counterparts, subdued studies in simple geometric forms which manage to
blend in with their surroundings, while still maintaining their own
distinctive style.  Of particular note is a building to the south, which
borders on being a small tower all its own.  Showing no signs of traditional
construction, it appears to have been shaped from a single large stone.

utilitarian, but every now and then the occasional Brintor stone edifice
will sport a column or the steep stairs of the classical Republican style. 
One building which is untouched by these stylistic changes is an open air
butcher's shop, which proffers its wares to the south.

bring their goods along this street.  The buildings lining the way are an
odd combination of ramshackle both and the occasional marble walled edifice.
Most of these seem devoted to shipping and storing the goods that pass
through the city, judging from both the signs and merchants moving in and
out of the premises.  The street is paved with the vaguely purple stones of
the Brintors, most worn a dull black by the travel this street sees.

#DESCRIPTION Scero Way heads north and south here, meandering through the outskirts of
Earendam's mercantile quarter.  The wooden tenements of the north have
ceased here, leaving the street surrounding by stone edifices on either
side.  Westward, travel is blocked by the soot-stained wall of a long, low
building.  More dramatically, a tall building carved from obsidian blocks
rises to the east, lofty columns looming over every other surrounding
building.  The street continues northward into an area of tenements and flop
houses, but makes a turn to the south.

oculus that breaks the surface of the roof.  Light reflects on the carved
mosaic in the floor, which depicts the precepts of Jolinn in shades of
sapphire and inlaid mother-of-pearl.  A rival even to Iandir's prevalent
religion in this city, Jolinn's temple is tended by an ancient group of
clergymen, and maintained by the city's wealthier patrons.  To the west, an
altar is set upon an illuminated dais, while alcoves lead north and south

horizontally along the hand.  Her other hand grips a magnificent flaming
sword highlighted with gleaming peridot, tourmaline, jasper, and ruby.  A

#NAME Lord Aviactas' Chamber
#DESCRIPTION Lord Aviactas's chambers are sparsely furnished, with most of the
furniture made of cold, grey stone.  The room is dimly lit, with a small
hanging chandelier providing most of the illumination.  Used as the nerve
center for most of the company's military activities, various maps and
rosters are inked on parchments affixed to the walls.  Aviactas's ebony desk
sits against the west wall, on which are stacked various scrolls in neat
piles.  The only exit from the room lies through a wooden door to the east.

One prominent passage reads:
 
The Binding doth serve two purposes in the advancement of the Art:
Firstly, it brings power, and in large measure - certainly, it cometh with
the Price, but the Price is only paid foolish enough to let the target of
their magic dies, and thus satisfies the Rule of Iron: Each punished
according to his folly.
 
 
The second purpose is oft overlooked among the uninitiated though.
Not only does the Binding give one increased strength, it also sharpens
the Will, and gives the scholar a more general practice in the bending of
the hearts of the weak-minded. One is compelled to practice the rites
effectively and diligently. How else could we open the ilamorphs channel
to the Void without the invocation of "Orbulg", or use other such verbal
commands?

#DESCRIPTION The introduction reads:
 
A lesser demon within the planes of Void, the Gharku
is said to dwell primarily in the sulfur vallyes of Alguth,
often serving in the entourage of the Named demons who
pass through this region.
 
 
...
 
The female Gharkus are often quite rapacious, requiring gifts
of magically imbued items to satiate their fury. Male Gharkus,
noted for bouts of lust, resist as long as they can before
succumbing to their nature. The most successful paramours 
often hoard magical items, accepting them in payment for terms
of magical contract, and will often viciously attack any wizard on
sight in hopes of acquiring magical lucre."
 
 
The book goes on to describe the actual details of Gharku
intimacy in great detail, including a series of illustrations, 
which the book touts as having been drawn by the observations
of over one hundred seperate Gharku summonings.

properties of the void and its connection to the prime material plane.
 
The long and short of the book seems to be a theoretical prediction that 
the plains of Shargob are inacessible through the use of the gate spell,
and a conjecture that other such areas of high negative magical energy
might also be inaccessible via gate.

#DESCRIPTION Penned by the noted shuddeni scholar Jakhravil, the text 
concerns the problem of the ch'taren.
 
Since the setbacks at the end of the War our people 
brought to the surface world, shuddeni have long debated
the proper policy of dealing with the ch'taren.
 
Firstly, the two tenets seem to be at odds. For certainly, the
Principle of Hate assures us that the ch'taren are little more 
than a pox on the body of the shuddeni, and as such should
be burned away. Bringing their decadent spirit magics and
alien and corrupt moral codes to Avendar, they pose a  
continuing threat to our inevitable and predestined mastery
of the world. Seemingly, the principle of Greed would 
contradict this truth - after all, have not the ch'taren prisoners 
at work in our cities near the crystal sea shown they can be
used, and used admirably? Should we not use any of
the lesser races in such a fashion, most of all the ones 
which so often have stood against us?
 
As those conversant with logic are aware, there are no true
contradictions, only apparent ones. Both the Principles of 
Hatred and Greed may be satisfied. For, is it not possible
to work a ch'taren to death in a slave mine?  Can we not
impose more restrictions, and not less on them? May not
a promise of better conditions be employed, when as a
point of fact the translucent ones are worked to their deaths? 
And this says nothing of the possibilities of the intelligent
use of the ch'taren life force once the foul things perish!
 
Herein, I will present the detailed plans for a new policy
toward ch'taren that will maximize both our own 
opportunities for vengeance as well as their potential 
use as a slave race...."
 
The text goes on to outline a rather extensive series of plans
for dealing  with the ch'taren, including elaborate plans to
use the ch'taren to expand the east wall of Yithoul into a 
series of chaja breeding pits and a new series of arcane
schools.

the tavern appear to be made from a poor cut of pine here, and the liberal
sprinklings of sawdust only serve to cover the rather common smell of the
place.  The only break in the monotony of the simple furnishings is an oil

red beast, striking at the walls of Krilin.  More shocking is the figure
*under* the bull -- a rather voluptuous woman, who writhes in the throes of
pleasure and quite distinctly has the look of the Krilin nobility.

the carved golden door that leads westward.  Crossing between the two towers
is a bridge of colored lights, made of a swirling cloud of mist and vapor.

#NAME Zanala's Chamber
#DESCRIPTION Zanala's chamber serves as the audience room of the head of the school. 
The opulence of the furnishings is tempered only by the sheer exotic nature
of the room's contents.  A delicate chandelier dangles from the ceiling, and
is carved completely from quartz.  Various stuffed creatures float, rather
than hang from the wall.  Among the menagerie is both a stuffed srryn head
as well as a dessicated cave slug.  The north wall is all shelving, and is
filled with all manner of arcane and exotic paraphernalia of the magics of
air.  The shelves hold everything from misty-delicate illusions of the races
of Avendar to a small crystal, which shines with a soft blue glow.  The
seating in the room is haphazard at best -- a leather couch floats a few
inches off the ground, while a few chairs remain obstinately bolted to the
floor.  The only exit from the chamber lies through an archway to the east.

Earendam.  Passing between the walls of the fabulous School of the Silver
Griffin to the north, and the hedges of the Patrician's garden to the south,
the river is a major throughfare for travel in the city.  The waters of the
Dantaron are deep here, clouded by the dark mud of its bottom, and the
frequent river-traffic along its course.  The river continues to the west,
but takes a bend to the north further east.

march across plains, bearing weapons of pure light to strike at the remnants
of the srryn horde.  Victorious aelin and a small band of humans march with
them, healing dead and shattered lands in the wake of the long years of the
war.  Carrying the banner of the Sons and Daughters of Jolinn, those humans
sided with the aelin march to complete victory.  The scenes after the battle
are those of healing and reconstruction.  Featured prominently are the
humans under the banner of Jolinn, who build two mighty towers.  One,
located near the Brintors, is topped with a dome of gold, and is marked in
runes as "Aramril" on the mural.  The other tower is built on an isle in the
midst of the Dantaron, and is labelled "Salyra".  Ascending to reign over
Salyra is a strikingly beautiful woman, while two brothers come to reign at
Aramril.  The mural ends with the focus on the tower of Salyra, where the
god Jolinn rises from the river to extend his blessing.

#NAME Atop an Arched Wooden Bridge
#DESCRIPTION This massive wooden bridge is made of massive oak logs, hewn and
varnished to be smooth to the touch.  The railings of the bridge are
intricately carved, forming ornate patterns in the wood.  Below the high
arch of the bridge lies the Dantaron River, which divides the city of
Earendam.  Northward lies the new city, built in the past few centuries.  To
the south lies the old city, much older and serving as the city's political
and religious center.

#NAME Atop an Arched Stone Bridge
#DESCRIPTION This arched stone bridge overlooks the course of the Dantaron river. 
Passing far below, the river carries the trade to and from Var Bandor in the
west, and the sea trade from the Uthlin, which lies east of the city. 
Carved from blocks of polished marble, the bridge is worn from years of
countless travel.  North of the bridge is "New Earendam", the part of the
city rebuilt after the wars with kankoran barbarians in the past few
centuries.  Southward is the old city, covered in buildings built in the
style of the Republic.  Built wide enough to handle three carriages abreast,
the bridge is a major throughfare for traffic of all sorts between the two
halves of the city.

#NAME Master's Chamber
#DESCRIPTION A lofty, barrel-vaulted chamber, this place serves as the office and
receiving chambers of Galin Nuvas, master of the Earendam watcher's enclave.
The high ceiling gives the room a lofty feel, and the spartan furnishings
only serve to exacerbate this effect.  The only seating is an oak desk in
the southwestern corner of the room, and the only trapping for the walls is
a series of pidgeonholes to the west of the desk.  A round doorway leads
northward, exiting the room.

platinum, while the horn on the right is made of flawless white marble and
the horn on the left seems to draw light into its deep onyx form.  Wind
seems to dramatically whip at the smooth hematite curves of her skirt,

decorated with extensive moldings, is hung with six enormous iron

with warm, yellow light.  Adorning the high walls are many tapestries,
exotic animal skins and finely crafted weapons.  In one corner is a small
display stand.  

This westerly half of the hall is warmed by two great open hearths, set into
the north and south walls.  The floor here is clear of furniture, beside a
few leather divans to the sides of the fireplaces.  Upon a raised platform
in the southwestern corner a small group of musicians play fine, soft music.

mahogany double doors leads out.

#KEYWORDS  corner small display stand
#DESCRIPTION Standing in one corner of the great room, this elegant stand is formed of
a dark stone, marbled with streaks of white.  The stand itself is empty, but
a brass placard notes in a flowing script:

Here rests the remnants of legendary Blade of Iniun, broken in a
long-since-forgotten battle centuries ago.  The intricate detail of the
bladework suggests that this piece was crafted by the famed Ghertin of
Avirle himself, though there is no actual record of such.  The blade is
rumored to have emitted a faint hum when it was whole, but if so, no trace
of such a sound remains in the shards.

Beneath the placard has been written, somewhat less elegantly on folded
parchment: With the recent threat of the so-called Scourge, and at the Order
of the Patrician, the pieces of the Blade of Iniun have been relocated to
safer locales.  If you wish to view it, you will need to inquire with the
Patrician himself, for part has been moved to his vault, or with the Port
Town of Gaald, which considerately offered to protect one of the larger
shards, or with the Tower of Aramril, which now keeps charge of the
remainder.  We apologize for the inconvenience.

carved from green-veined marble, and marble also are the high walls into
which the pillars are set, and the mirror-like floor which forms a perfect
reflection of this magnificent hall.  The florid architraves and orniture
are carved in alabaster and jade, and seem to shine in transluscent
splendour.  Another archway exits the hallway to the east.

#DESCRIPTION This square chamber rises some forty feet to a high domed ceiling above. 
The dome is supported by wide arches, which in turn are supported by
unadorned pillars in each of the four corners.  The dome, arches and pillars
are of a dark, veined marble, but the walls themselves are of smooth, white
stone.  The chamber is bathed in a natural light, although its source seems
far from natural - a great chandelier high above flickers with magical
were-lights.  

The white walls of this gallery are lined with many works of art, done in a
wide variety of media.  A few armchairs, set near the center of the room,
allow for more comfortable viewing.  A tightly-wound spiral staircase of
wood and iron leads to a balcony some twenty feet overhead, where yet more
paintings are displayed.  Open archways lead through the east and west
walls, and a set of bronze-bound mahogany double doors stand closed to the
south.  Next to the doors stands a low, marble pedestal, atop which is a

             "The Dance of the Naiad", by Elfeal Qilheni
              - Oreinn period, water colour on canvas

One of the early works of renowned ethron artist Elfeal Qilheni, "The
Dance of the Naiad" is an excellent example of the Oreinn style of painting.
Here we see the well-known hallmarks of this style: strong sensual
overtones, and a freedom, even a frivolity of imagination in choice of
subject matter.  The freedom of the subject matter is paralleled by a
freedom of style.  None of the rigours of the earlier Hisilan or modern
Tierild appear here.  The artist uses her water colours to capture an
intuitive impression, rather than a precise, detailed representation. 
Perhaps the true mastery of this piece is in the motive exuberance with
which the element of water has been captured; both in the graceful, fluid
frolicking of the naiad, and the accompanying dance of the ripples and
reflected forest.

#DESCRIPTION A vibrant wash of vivid blues and greens, this painting immerses the 
viewer in a tranquil, watery world. Depicted is a young female figure, 
her bare skin in shimmering aquamarine hues, smiling coyly up from the
crystal-clear pond where she swims. Although motionless, the artist has 
managed to capture the illusion of movement. The naiad's lithe form is 
set in a dynamic pose; she seems almost to writhe through the water, 
her figure slicing the glassy surface into a complex pattern of ripples. 
Although the forest surrounding the pond is not expicitly depicted, its 
warped reflection frames the naiad's figure, and seems nearly as mobile 
as the water spirit herself. 


A wooden plaque hangs next to this painting.

              "Ysthael ceremonial robe", artist unknown
       - Srryn Suiah period, natural dyes on alligator hide

An exquisite example of the Srryn Suiah period, this ceremonial
alligator-hide robe was first worn by Vassethellin, founder of the Ysthael
Sept of fire templars.  It was used by successive leaders of that Sept
primarily during rituals of initiation.  The robe came into the hands of the
Gallery in Saithekan's time, during the upheaval surrounding his deposition.

It is an example of Suiah art at its prime, just preceding the War of Fire. 
The crudeness of this piece is belied by the startling composition, in which
the work viewed as a whole seems to hold more information than the sum of
its parts.  A few other Suiah pieces display similar quality of composition,
although such mastery is typically the exception, not the rule.

#DESCRIPTION A heavy robe of alligator skin hangs stretched across the wall here,
sturdy brass clips holding it unfurled. The hide is a landscape of 
scales of varying shapes and sizes; shifting from a jagged ridge 
of spiny scales running vertically down the center to broad plains 
of smooth, shimmering plates toward the edges. The original colour of 
the hide is unclear, as every scale has been brightly dyed to create 
a complex mosaic. 

The mosaic speaks of violence and battle, with two sides - one srryn, 
one human - in pitched combat. The humans are portrayed as diminutive 
beings, armour-clad and wielding steel, yet clearly dominated by the 
dragon-like srryn. The scaled behemoths rend the humans with razor claws 
and engulf them in arcs of magical flame. The ridge of scales in the 
center of the piece has been dyed in violent reds and oranges to 
depict a spiraling inferno. The largest of the srryn figures seems to 
revel at the heart of this conflagration, sending cords of flame across 
the battlefield.

A surprising level of detail has been rendered in this crude format. 
Individual figures are difficult to resolve when studied separately; 
each being the composition of only a dozen or so dyed scales. However, 
viewed as a whole, the piece gains cohesion, and the role of each 
combatant in the vignette is made clear, be they a trampled human 
soldier or a triumphant srryn fire templar.

A plaque of ivory is inset into the wall beside the alligator skin.

wood, surrounded by two dozen high-backed chairs. A couple of smaller 
tables stand closer to the center of the room. Three open hearths are set 
in the north, south and east walls. A small archway in the northeast corner

#DESCRIPTION A portrait of an aelin lady hangs in this gilded frame, initially
unremarkable, save for its obvious technical mastery and its superb
composition of form.  The lady is beautiful, this much is also immediately
clear, and it is this beauty which holds your eye a moment longer; long
enough to be ensnared by the true genius of the piece.  

The woman's face seems to demand examination.  At first it appears young. 
Her features are pale and noble, framed by thick coils of raven-black hair. 
Upon inspection, however, lines of wisdom, grace and strength are revealed. 
She holds an expression of astute appraisal, and it is this expression which
draws your gaze toward her almond eyes.  An instant's hesitation allows you
to realise that you had avoided meeting those eyes until now.  However the
subtlety of the artist is great, and you find yourself immersed in their
emerald depths before prudence can dictate otherwise.  

Her eyes are like the sea.  Green and nurturing at first they seem, as the
ocean of the Sapphire Spear, yet the potential for tempestuous fury is also
there - a perilous glint which plays about the pupils.  An untameable
quality hides in their dark depths, which are cold and hidden, and somehow
otherworldly.  Vertigo seizes you as you gaze at them, and you feel as though
you hover above the ocean indeed.  As some stray gull on a wayward wind, or
as a dreamer lost in imagined flight you drift there, precarious, until with
a sudden rush and a heart-lurching plummet the real world swims back to meet
you.  You catch a last glimpse in your descent, a peripheral impression of
some trapped emotion -- that of fear -- the fear of someone imprisoned and
alone.  But the image fades, and you stare once more at an aelin lady,
framed in gold.

victim at various points around the temple and about the back of the head.

                The Blessing of Light, artist unknown
                  - oil on canvas, Celestial period

This example of the Celestial period of painting shows the typical
impressionist qualities of that style.  The boy's face is defined not by
strict, precise lines as in the Hisilan or Slirucasro periods, but rather by
arrangements of hazy light and shadow.  Vibrant colors and ample use of
texture bring the figures and setting to life, and seem almost as much a
celebration of the medium (here oil on canvas) as of the scene itself.  The
presence of a Ch'taren as a divine figure in this work marks the artist as
human. Following the War of Night, many humans saw the new-come Ch'taren as
godly saviours, and depicted them as such in paintings influences by the
Ch'tarens' own style.  Ch'taren artists of this period tended to restrict
their divine works to depictions of Rystaia, often presiding over groups of
ch'taren.

            "The Solution", by Yyakhuthos of Yithoul
      - Ashi Uzitha period, alchemically-induced pigment on onyx

An unusual piece, this work is one of the last known examples of the Ashi
Uzitha period.  Its abstraction is typical of shuddeni art from before the
War of Night, in which the true imagery of the piece was often only apparent
to the peculiar vision of shuddeni.  This particular work was painted after
the War, as is apparent from the ch'taren victim.  By this stage most
shuddeni works were of the Krag Uzitha school, and influenced by the realism
of the aelin Hisilan style.  

This work was painted in Earendam by artist and priest Yyakhuthos of
Yithoul, shortly before his death.  The Champions of Avendar had held the
piece for centuries after artist's death, naturally unaware of its nature or
worth. The Gallery thanks the Tower of Aramril for access to its archive,
and its subsequent donation of the masterpiece.

                 - Oil on board, Pious period

Eina Daidil, or 'Ascendant Journey' was painted by Aerelin Madrisu 
at the peak of his popularity, and has been hailed by many scholars 
as the pinnacle of this master's developement of symbolism. Madrisu 
is held as one of the leaders in the Aelin Pious movement. Distinct 
from Early Pious works, the Pious period saw a dramatic increase in 
detail as well as the introduction of abstract symbolism. In the case 
of "Eina Daidil", we see two godlike aelin figures. The male figure is 
thought to represent the god Serachel, and the female  to represent 
the aelin people in general. The female is enraptured with the male, 
and seems willing to follow him anywhere. The male has his eyes set on 
the far distance. The common interpretation is that Madrisu sought to 
represent Serachel as "looking beyond" the current state of the aelin 
people, to a more glorious future. This was, afterall, the popular 
attitude toward the god at this time. Some scholars contend that 
Madrisu, instead of echoing the sentiment of his people at the time, 
was more of a visionary, and suggested in his work that the aelins' 
patron looked beyond the aelin to his own selfish ends.

#DESCRIPTION The statue before you is a richly sculpted full body portrait of a
caladaran woman.  The sculpture itself is created of a myriad of colours of
stones, rocks, and shimmering gems.  On her thin frame is fitted a stylish
black dress, crafted of the finest, most polished ebony.  It flows about her
form, lapping backward at her feet as some invisible wind appears to hold it
in place.  In her hands, she thrusts a staff forth commandingly, its ends
tipped with quartz crystals that shine like jagged flecks of ice.  Upon her
right shoulder is branded a shimmering golden mark of the Eye of Enaerai. 
Her generally attractive face is set in an expression of determination.  Two
eyes made of shining copper peer out beneath a strong brow, and her thin yet
rouged lips are pursed into a line.  On her head, she wears a marble
approximation of the Dragon Crown, formed with utmost care to become a
nearly exact likeness of the item.  

Standing protectively behind the woman is a great elemental of stone.  It
appears identical to any earth elemental seen with a scholar as it stands,
frozen in time, with its arms extended in a half-circle around her torso. 
Hovering exactly three feet above her extended staff is a pair of rocks
which appear to be small meteors.  Wisps of binding magic occaisionally
flash between the two meteors and the edge of the sculpture's staff, yet
otherwise the pair float seamlessly, spinning in the air to give the
illusion of forward motion.

    "Eolaapese Rurlil"  ("The Dream of Reality"), by Phusreu Dvilliyo
               - Aelin Ir period, azure marble and iron

Aptly named "Eolaapese Rurlil", or the Dream of Reality, this sculpture is
the work Phusreu Dvilliyo.  Dvilliyo was perhaps the most famous of the
aelin Ir sculptors, and much is still known about his life and works, with
extensive writings surviving the thousands of years since his demise.  This
statue is the prize of the Earendam collection, donated by Ilodaiya as a
sign of goodwill and shared culture.  

This piece is particularly extravagant, even for the Ir period.  The fact
that the figure in the piece is a woman instead of a man, as was
traditional, is a symbol of the dreamlike message.  The aelin seems ready to
take to the sky, both in body and in spirit, on the verge of attaining an
ultimate freedom.  Her robes, touching the ground, are symbols of the
material world, which binds the aelin with its physical needs and social
responsibilities.  The anklet, however, suggests that this binding is
voluntary.  The anklet is fashioned out of a runil, a tool of office of the
judges in Aelin society, a symbol of the rules of the aelin life.  The
suggestion is that the aelin could remove her binding if she so chose, but
does not.  Eolaapese Rurlil is truly a symbol of the Aelin condition, with
the possiblities of freedom, but the acknowledgement of reponsibility and
the love of order, though it constrains them at times.

#DESCRIPTION The marble statue before you seems to almost move, such is the profusion
of windblown drapery covering the central figure.  An aelin woman stretches
for the sky, cloaked in billowing robes.  The woman's body itself is not
touching the base of the piece, except for a light brush with her left foot,
which appears to be about to lift from the base altogether.  Instead the
carved woman is held up by the folds and billows of her robe, as they trail
behind her, more earthbound than her figure itself.  Her left ankle is
encircled by what appears to be an anklet fashioned out of a runil.  The
entire statue has the faint bluish hue of the marble the aelin's tend to use
in sculpting, and is exquistitely carved, with the edges sharp enough to
show that the statue has been preserved through time by magic.  

A brass plaque is set into the pedestal beneath the sculpture.

         "Aelin Enpu" ("The Order of Aelin"), by Dostyn Aellivin
                   - Aelin As period, azure marble

This statue, titled The Order of Aelin, or "Aelin Enpu", used to stand in
the summer home of an extremely wealthy Aelin noble, but that house was
taken during the War of Fire.  After the srryn conquered the small village
where the house stood, they pried the gems out of the eyes of the Rilos
Enpu, but considered the statue itself worthless.  After the War of Fire,
the statue was recovered by the surviving family members, and later donated
to this gallery, where it was restored as best it could be.  

The perfect symmetrical design of the statue is in character with the
Aelin As period, carved in the slightly blue-tinted marble that was often
used by aelin sculptors.  The arm reaching forward is a bit of an
advancement for that time.  The small leaf and crown on his hand signify the
order that the aelin are bringing to the world around them.  The world is
the leaf, and the crown represents order, a symbol of course, for Lord
Iandir.  At the time the statue was carved, the world was still recovering
from the Sundering, so the order brought to the surrounding environment was
an important theme to the Aelin.

#DESCRIPTION The statue standing before you is tall, slightly larger than lifesize. 
Carved entirely from marble, the figure of an Aelin stands perfectly
straight, his wide empty eyes, which were once set with gems of some colour,
gaze forward without expression.  His wings arch perfectly symmetrical
behind his back, though time has claimed the upper tip of the left wing,
leaving a smooth worn edge in its absence.  One hand extends forward, and
resting on it is a delicate metal leaf, encircled by a small marble crown. 
His feet are set together, and his other arm lies straight against his side.

A bronze plaque is set into the statue's pedestal.

#DESCRIPTION Jofis Tabr's study has the look of a place well on its way to a state of
terminal disorder.  Stacks of parchment and vellum fill his desk, which is a
battered ironwood affair, marked deeply with ink stains and the ground-in
marks of continued writing.  The south wall of the room is completely taken
up by a tall bookshelf, which contains a wide assortment of historical
tomes.  High windows on the west wall provide illumination during the day,
while lamps set in the east wall light the room at night.  The only exit

#NAME Beneath the High Dome
#DESCRIPTION A circular platform of white marble is suspended high up in the middle of
this chamber, surrounded on all sides by an airy drop, some sixty feet to
the floor below.  The precarious nature of this perch is enhanced by the
absence of any railing.  Instead, a ring of lush, potted plants stand on its
edge, their sprawling growth creeping across the marble and hanging freely
over the sides.  The plants are studded with beautifully exotic flowers of
many different colours.

Level with the platform, in the walls of the chamber, are a ring of high,
narrow arched windows.  These are interspersed with huge pillars of fluted
marble, which rise to support the great vault of the ceiling.  The arches of
the vault rise to an apex, from which hangs a highly abstract mobile.  Long
arcs carved from bone - perhaps the tusks or ribs of some enormous beast -
form a many-layered sphere, with each arc hanging at a different angle to
the next.  Immediately beneath the mobile, in the center of the platform,
are spread several large cushions.

The whole platform has the impression of floating in mid-air, apparently
supported only by the narrow bridge which leads the outer wall of the
chamber, and so to the stairway down.

#KEYWORDS  symbolvision
#DESCRIPTION The sensuous arcs of the Tear of Pricina quickly enrapture the eye as you
stare up at it, your eye hungrily tracing each lithesome, evocative curve. 
It seems now that these forms move toward you, or perhaps it is that your
perception moves upward, drawn to the exquisitely petalled nexus at the
heart of the symbol.  

The slender curves of the Tear now surround you, and it becomes clear that
each is merely an outline, a silhouette of some fuller shape.  Before long
these shapes resolve themselves into female forms of shivering beauty.  They
shift and tense their supine figures, as though wracked with some anxious
passion.  And step-by-tentative step they move towards you.  Slender hands,
with skin as pure as porcelain, reach out to you.  In you imagination they
slowly, delicately, remove pieces of your clothing, until their hands brush,
almost nervously, against your skin.  

The heart of the symbol now hangs above you, having resolved into an exotic
orchid, or a complex, many-petalled lotus, beautiful beyond imagining.  You
reach forward to pluck it, eager to make it your own, and the hands of the
surrounding succubi guide your own hands encouragingly.  

But Suddenly you realise that the lotus is no small, delicate flower at all.
It dwarfs you, each of its complex petals larger than your entire body, and
each covered with many rows of inward-pointing spines.  The petals begin to
separate, stretching towards you as they move, revealing a ruddy, gaping maw
in their midst.  The succubi press you from all sides, gripping you with
dozens of hands, each now black as pitch and cruelly clawed, and bite with
full-lipped mouths, each filled with razor teeth.  You are shoved toward the
hungry opening with irresistable force, and the petals grasp at your flesh,
drawing you inwards.  Yet despite your great horror, and the knowledge of
the oblivion which awaits you within that maw, you do not for a moment
consider resisting.  

In an instant the vision passes, and you find yourself lying in Pricina's
shrine once more.  Your body quakes slightly, and you realise that you are
unclad.  The Tear of Pricina, however, is forever burned into both your mind
and your soul.

north, west, and south walls, with similar tables and chairs for reading
neatly arranged throughout the room.  The room is illuminated by small
crystal hemispheres, affixed by an archway to the west, which also provides
the only exit from the library.

#NAME Mistress Eninia's Chamber
#DESCRIPTION These are the personal chambers of Mistress Eninia, head of the Circle of
the Erudite Eye.  Without a doubt, this room shows the trappings of
considerable wealth, but never in a way that fails to be subtle.  The center
of attention for the room is a writing desk, on which sits an alchemical
ornament and a small scrollcase.  The walls of the room are light mahogany,
carved near the floor and ceiling with a frieze of mystic symbols.  The only
would-be sign of ostentatiousness here lies to the north, where a golden
door leads out of the chamber.  

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  frieze mystic symbol symbols
#DESCRIPTION This bleached mahogany frieze is a band of lighter wood roughly a foot
wide at the foot and top of the wall.  Carved with a decorative mishmash of
spreading, curling symbols, the mystical pattern is designed to soothe and
focus the mind, rather than bind or serve any other specific purpose.  

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  alchemical ornament
#DESCRIPTION This simple ornament serves no utilitarian purpose, seeming to be an
award from several years ago.  A stylized eye surrounded by nine simple
runes, each representing an alchemical bias, this disk of silver-plated
steel now serves as a paperweight.

#NAME A Pleasantly Decorated Home
#DESCRIPTION An atmosphere of comfort surrounds this spacious room.  Spanning part of
the hardwood floor is a large pale rug, tastefully interwoven with threads
of blue and green about the edges.  In one corner stands a double sleigh bed
carved from a rich, dark oak and overlaid with a thick mattress.  Near the
bed, a small nightstand rests just below a blue-tinted window.  During the
day, sunlight seems to veritably pour through the glass, richly illuminating
most of the room.  One corner seems perpetually dim, however, lit only by
the dancing flames of the homey basalt fireplace.  The emblem of a regal
crown is inlaid over the mantle, its bright lines providing a appealing
contrast to the greenish-black gloss of the stone.  Two chairs and a small
table fill the corner just left of the door.  Across from these simple
furnishings a small spring bubbles, the miniature geyser of pure water
falling into a circular moat carved in the floor for that purpose.  

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  pale rug edges
#DESCRIPTION This elliptical rug carpets the corner of the room near the fireplace,
enhancing the mein of comfort.  Its simple pale color is offset neatly with
a patterned weaving of blue and green about its perimeter.  The floor
beneath seems to be sturdily crafted from a dark hardwood.  

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  fireplace homey flames basalt dancing
#DESCRIPTION Crackling softly with its own warmth, a small fire takes up its lodging
within this fireplace.  A wooden mantle seems to spring up of its own accord
from either side of basalt hearth, forming into a shelf just above the
gentle blaze.  

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  mantle
#DESCRIPTION Crafted from wood of the same dark color that pervades much of the room's
furnishings, this mantle forms into a shelf over the fireplace.  Set
slightly above it is the insignia of a crown.  

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  regal crown emblem inlaid bright
#DESCRIPTION Care was clearly taken to form this symbol, which is more than merely
reminescent of the emblem of the Crown of Law.  In its making, the hard
basalt of the fireplace seems to have been cut away and filled with lines of
some bright metal.  At times, the insignia glints with the light of the fire
below, momentarily enhancing its already apparent contrast with the dark
stone about it.  

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  nightstand small
#DESCRIPTION Set alongside the large bed, this small nightstand contains three
drawers.  Perched upon it is a small painting of a petite human female in
close proximity to an unusually massive aelin male.  

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#KEYWORDS  window blue blue-tinted tinted
#DESCRIPTION Rounded at the top, this expansive window is otherwise rectangular. 
Despite its blue tint, sunlight seems to stream uninhibited into the room
during the day.  As a result, most of the room is rather well-lit in
daylight hours.  A small iron-framed lantern rests on the windowsill for use
during the night.
