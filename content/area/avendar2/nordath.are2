#DESCRIPTION A knobbly, thick young tree thrusts from the ground here, bent and
twisted.  Its skin is smooth and flaky like birchbark, but black as
midnight.  A faint sheen coats the bark, as though it were greasy or
otherwise damp.  The ground about the tree's base is decidedly darker than
the soil nearby, and is torn up and disturbed.  The sapling's whippish
branches seem to tremble, straining and twisting away in all directions
crazily.  Leaves the shape and color of parchment ashes grow thickly along
the branches, rustling loudly at every movement.  Large, tangled roots
thrust their way from the ground like knuckles.  A distinct smell of carrion
lingers unpleasantly around the sapling.

homely in her youth as well, her missing teeth and the splotches of red on
her face do nothing to enhance her appearance.  Her eyes dart around in an
unusual way, and her whole appearance is one that suggests she may be
somewhat unstable.

#DESCRIPTION This lone page, seemingly torn from a standard scholar's journal, bears
the following text in graceful handwriting:

Evenday, 17th day of Converumir

Today I set out from Earendam with our company.  In total, we are five
scholars and ten warriors.  Two of the scholars are my fellow Salyrans, we
being the tower's most skilled adepts in the spells of curse removal.  The
other two scholars, of the Order of the Silver Light, travel with us as well,
likewise skilled in the countering of curses.  The complementary escort
of guards, we have rather resented--as if this band has need of the patrician's
protection! We appreciated the irony of the situation though--one of the
spirit scholars, a human named Tov, noted rightly how it is the patrician
who always seems to be in need of protection.

The patrician, I understand, has contacts with Chevellen, a nobly-born
Salyran adept, and asked him to organize a party of cursebreakers.  Why he
chose not to approach the guildmasters, and rely on (highly capable) adepts,
I can't say--I've no head for political manuevering.  But we, of course, jumped
at the chance to challenge this curse, even if the circumstances of our
departure are less forthright than we would chose.  Defeating such a curse
would make a case for guildrank advancement, for certain!  

We only know rumors of Nordath--that it lies in a deep forested valley with
a single pass entrance, and that the valley is located in the North Forest,
near its southern end,  almost bordering the grasslands.  Nordath  was, 
as the history texts describe it, once the seat of an important Barony
of the old Earendam republic.  The curse supposedly involves
old spirits and undead, and even demons.

We've heard that the curse has drawn mortals who enter the valley
under its power, and that the bones of those who die rise again, joining the
undead. I, of course, have been taking the standard measures of precaution-
one can never be too careful when dealing with curses.  And my dear Ladiira
was so worried when she heard of the journey. But there has never been
such a company as this, I told her, for challenging ill hexes--we could even lift
the blight off of the Shargob, no doubt.  In fact, I'd even suggest such a trip to 
Shargob to my companions, once we finish our work here, if it wouldn't keep me 
long from my Ladiira's side.
-Awsar

#DESCRIPTION An odd flail, looking as if it were made of shadows, is here.
#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  flail
#DESCRIPTION The flail is of large size, with a handle length that would allow for
two-handed use.  But it is extremely light--unnaturally so.  The material
seems to be of iron when seen from a certain angle, but most clearly appears
to be a dark, semi-opaque, shadowy substance.

(Chorus) 
We'll dance the night in the twin moonlight 
And strum on the lute till mornin'. 
We'll stamp our feet to the wild-wood beat 
And dance with the bears of Goran. 
(v1) 
Young Elberdine loves Eril wine 
And fancies he's a drinker, 
But keep him away from firespray 
Or he'll wind up in the clinker. 
(follow with chorus) 
(v2) 
A srryn and his shuddeni friend 
Were boozing over dice. 
They had to sneer at the poisoned beer, 
The srryn said, "That tastes nice!" 
(chorus) 
(v3) 
Old man Nit found a maglat pit 
And poked his head down in, 
The maglat ate the duffer's pate, 
But left the double chin. 
(chorus)
(v5) 
You may suppose a titan's nose 
Is shorter than a dragon's, 
I've seen them both and by my oath 
They'd both look fine on wagons. 
(chorus)
(v6) 
Now don't you say the song we play 
Is frivolous and folly, 
You'll soon be humming with the tune, 
And sing it in the holly. 
(chorus)

#DESCRIPTION This large room has been carved into the stone of the cliff face. 
Burbling and hissing with controlled action, it has been converted into a
rather impressive laboratory.  A massive stone counter squats in the center
of the room, covered with glass and metal instruments in a bewildering
profusion of tubes, burners, and flasks.  Parchment note-pads are laid out
at regular intervals.  Counters along the walls are also lined with shelves
and drawers, many covered with neat labels printed out in a precise
shorthand.  An odd set of shelves stands freely in one rounded corner of the
room.  A large, organic, chimney-like vent curves its way out of the
ceiling, opening over the island.  Shallow stone shelves carved into the
wall near the ceiling are planted with large, wide mushrooms which glow with
unnaturally bright light, illuminating the room.  Stone doorways lead east
and west.

notebooks, all inundated with indecipherable scribbles.  Laid out in precise
ranks and files across the rest of the workbench are countless alchemical
paraphenalia - burners, boilers, beakers, flasks, stills, retorts, and many

#NAME The Entrance to Nordath Valley
#DESCRIPTION You are at the entrance to a small, secluded valley which stretches out
towards the east.  The valley would seem picaresque to most, with green
conifers and various broad-leafed trees forming a patched canopy above the
younger trees, thick bushes, and the grassy floor.  The sloped hills that
form the valley are so steeply inclined that climbing them would be nigh
impossible, yet they do descend lower at this point than elsewhere, and a
broad ravine splits the slope in two to the west.  The intermittent rustling
of leaves is the only sound in this place, which should normally be full of
the typical sounds of the wildwoods.

of a maze to navigate.  The silent sylvan forest would seem peaceful and
serene to most, if it were not for the very noticeable, unnatural quiet that
hangs in the air.  It is as if the animals that would normally dwell in such
a place have all fled or been spirited away.  Directly to the west and

in the southeast, looming over the treetops, stand the ruins of a large

#NAME A Dark Dell
#DESCRIPTION The grass turf on this side of the dell is wet and spongy, as if a small
spring wells up under the green lattice at some point, or as if a streamlet
has left its course to spread its water evenly throughout the grass.  The
trees are thinner here than elsewhere in the dell, but the ground is thick
with large, bushy shrubs and small flowering plants.  Willows in small
stands are intermixed with spiked cattails, and the few trees there are have
large deposits of moss and lichen.  A single wild rosebush adds a splash of
vibrant red to the forest greens and muted browns of the other foliage. 
Framing this side of the dell, steep rock slopes rise at a near-vertical
angle, blocking passage to the north and west.

#DESCRIPTION This forested niche in Nordath valley is quiet and dark.  The trees grow
slightly thinner to the north, but at this point and to the east are
clustered tightly together.  Lines of tall, thin poplars are bunched
together in rows, looking like thin ribs thrusting up from the pale green of
the grass.  There is a muffling, claustrophobic feel to the area, which is

leaves.  Because the visibility is so limited, and the trees so dense, you

valley.  A profusion of briars to the east prevent passage in that
direction.

disrepair, but still stand despite time and wear, ringing the long-abandoned
inner court and keep.  The thick walls are formed of large grey and brown
stone blocks in various stages of erosion and breakage.  From the
battlements, the deep dry moat and lush forest beyond is visible, as are the
distant green slopes that form Nordath valley.  The battlements here run
along the fore-wall, stretching north and south.

courtyard and the keep.  At your feet, the years of debris and weeds are
unable to hide completely the rusting remains of a massive steel barbican,
half-buried in the soil.  The twisted and punctured metal of the barbican is
a silent testament to Nordath's fall.

#NAME Nordath's Crumbling Battlements
#DESCRIPTION This stretch of battlement is one of the few places where jagged
defensive crenelations still stand.  Centuries of weathering haven't
completely worn away the simple stylistic stonework from some of the
crenelation stones.  Elsewhere along the wall-top, the outer portion of the
wall has crumbled to such a degree that the defensive stonework and much of
the bulk of the wall have disappeared.  This is the likely source of much of
the rubble in the dry moat that encircles the ruined fortress.

#NAME Nordath's Crumbling Battlements
#DESCRIPTION The 30-foot-thick battlements are worn with age but still secure enough
to walk upon.  In some areas pits and cracks make walking the battlements no
easy effort.  The battlements afford an excellent view of the valley of
Nordath.  The lush verdant canopy of forest extends all the way to the steep
valley walls, and from this vantage point it seems as if you are afloat in a
sea of green.  Beyond the battlement, a deep moat marks the dividing line of
forest and stronghold ruins, even though grass, bushes, and slender trees
have begun to invade the courtyard within the walls.

now lean against the battlement wall, and the stalls now hold only chunks of
grey and brown stone, fallen from the battlement wall, and the plants that
have crept up among them.  The moss on the old timbers and on the stone
walls and debris suggest that this corner of the fortress receives little

iron candle-ring lays half-buried in the dirt and broken floorstones, a
rusted relic of Nordath's better days.  The walls are rough, pocked from the
many places where stone blocks have crumbled away or fallen out of the
crumbling, chalk-white mortar.  A small doorway opens up into a passageway
in the western wall, and the room continues on to the north.

#DESCRIPTION You stand in what would have once been the spacious main hall of Nordath
keep.  The hall is now under the open sky--only a few broken supporting
timbers jutting from the walls mar the view above.  The collapse of a second
floor of the keep would give reason for the large amount of stone debris
here.  Marble columns set in the eastern wall--the only wall not split with
cracks--bear weathered carvings.  The ancient symbol of Nordath, the
blue-winged hawk clutching crossed spears, is prominent on many of them.  In
one corner of the room, a large mound raises higher than the other wreckage
and debris in the hall.  Human bones are visible among the dirt and weeds
that partially cover the pile.  To the west stands the wide entrance to the
hall.  Covered passageways which have remained relatively intact open up in
the northern and southern walls, and a staircase set among the carved
columns in the eastern wall leads upward.

wall is slowly crumbling away, but remains mostly solid due its unusual
thickness and solid construction.  The brown and grey boulders that have
formed the outer face of the wall have in many places fallen out, and are
strewn about the dried moat below.  It is a dangerous drop down to the
bottom of the moat.

to walk upon.  In some areas pits and cracks make walking the battlements no
easy effort.  They afford, though, an excellent view of the valley of
Nordath.  The lush verdant canopy of forest extends all the way to the steep
valley walls, and from this vantage point it seems as if you are afloat in a
sea of green.  Beyond the battlement, a deep moat marks the dividing line of
forest and stronghold ruins, even though grass, bushes, and slender trees
have begun to invade the courtyard within the walls.  Far to the west, a
fissure in the valley wall marks the ravine which provides the primary
access to the valley.

#NAME The Valley of Nordath
#DESCRIPTION You stand in a forested valley.  Through the trees, you see the steep
valley walls, their slopes covered in green foliage.  To the south a large
dilapidated structure, once a castle or fortress, is visible.  The
surrounding forest seems unusually quiet, lacking the animal and insect
sounds that are found in other wooded areas.  The ground inclines steeply to
the north, until it forms a vertical cliff.

#NAME The Valley of Nordath
#DESCRIPTION You stand in the northeastern end of Nordath valley, surrounded by the
thick hardwoods and tall, bushy pines that form the valley forest.  To the
north and east, the vertical faces of steep brown cliffs rise hundreds of
feet up to the forest above.  However, at the base of the cliff eastward, a
jutting outcrop of stone creates a sheltered ledge below.  Visible through
the trees to the southwest is the outer walls of the ruined fortress,
standing relatively intact.

the cursed valley.  To the west, the thick forest of Nordath valley
stretches into the distance.

#NAME A Dark, Orderly Garden
#DESCRIPTION This clearing in the dense woods is surrounded by a high wall of
featureless dark stone.  Roughly square, it seems to center on the large
cage which stands in the center.  A small path of black gravel encircles it,
which is in turn bordered by a ring of large, thorny shrubs.  The garden is
wild and the plants closest the cage seem almost to shudder from time to
time.  Many more different types of plants forming snarled, vague shapes
among the paths.  A hanging carpet of thick, heavy creeper vines climb the
wall and twist their way into the surrounding trees.  A small block of onyx
sits against the southeastern wall.  The entire clearing is subsumed with an
oppressive gloom - the garden seems filled with deep shadows, and the air
within seems almost hazy.  The trees around the outside lean inwards
somewhat, enclosing the garden in even further.  To the east, the wall stops
at a steep stone cliff-face, where a large, rectangular doorway has been
carved.  To the west, a gap in the wall leads out through a briar hedge.

#KEYWORDS  hanging carpet creeper vine vines
#DESCRIPTION This thick mass of creeper vines borders the garden on the northern and
southern walls.  Heavy and choking, the vines writhe and tangle amongst
themselves, stifling out any competing vegetation.  They surge over the tops
of the wall and climb into the trees.  Small, hard fruits of a smooth brown
can be seen growing at some of the joints and forks in the mass, the little
nodes seemingly protected by the growth of the plant.

#KEYWORDS  garden plant shrub shrubs plants
#DESCRIPTION The garden is filled with a great many plants laid out in a geometric
pattern interspersed with patches of thick moss and paths of dark gravel. 
All specimens in the garden seem to be selected from species which are
particularly hardy, poisonous, or prolific.  Many types of thorned, choking,
or woody vegetation can be seen.

#KEYWORDS  high wall
#DESCRIPTION This stone wall is built from unshaped blocks of stone, well-fitted
together with a master mason's eye.  Very little mortar is required to hold
the stones together, and the wall seems quite sturdy and thick.  Roughly ten
feet in height, the wall executes a square with corners at each of the
cardinal compass points.  Openings in the eastern and western points lead
out of the garden, the wall actually built into the cliff face to the east.
