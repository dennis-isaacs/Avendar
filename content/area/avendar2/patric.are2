the rise of Earendam's power, the Order is made up mostly of young templars,
untested in war.  Popular practice among nobles in the Patrician's favor is
to send their youngest children to join the Order, where they receive

Once a great battle leader of Earendam's armies, his career was cut short
when he lost his arm in a battle to the death with a powerful srryn fire
templar who was plotting to lead his people to war.  Now retired, he trains
the young templars of the Order, and stands watch over the maze.  He is
well-known among the Patrician's political circles, and often acts as
advisor in military matters.  

Neither retirement nor dismemberment has softened Rugater, whose field armor
is polished and ready for battle.  The man himself is tall and lean, with a
whip-like quality to his movement.  His face is craggy with age, and
features several prominent scars acquired in battle.  Steely gray eyes peer
out from under his helmet, evaluating the world in terms of the battlefield.

The last hierophant of the Sakmi Sjijia, Rimiasti tends the 'Sha Ec Shanc',
or 'The Gift of Firiel', the scion of the Great Tree which grows here in the

not through a noble inheritance.  

Bitna is one of Earendam's wealthiest merchants, having made his fortune in
river trade with Var Bandor, and moving furs and gems across the Uthlin. 
Wealthy enough to not be ignored even by the nobility, he is a frequent

blue velvet, with a ruffle of white lace on his chest and at his wrists.  

Savalan sits on the Patrician's Council, the most powerful ruling body in
Earendam outside of the Patrician himself.  Prodigious analytical abilities,
and a savant-like skill at tallying sums lead to a career in Earendam's
great banks.  After making several fortunes for his noble, but poor family,
he was eventually appointed to the position of treasurer on the Council. 
Now, he is never far from the Patrician's side, and consistently a frugal
master of the exchequer.

and his nose sharp and prominent, but most of the rest of his features are
obscured by a thick silver beard.  He wears brown robes, embroidered with
faintly glowing arcane symbols, and numerous mystical accoutrements dangle
from his waist.  

Kanlarus sits on the Patrician's Council, the most powerful body in Earendam
outside of the Patrician himself.  Long known for his abilities in using the
magics of earth in architecture, he also has studied at the Tower of Salyra,
focusing on the more divinatory aspects of the magics of water.  His
combination of experience and breadth of knowledge, as well as a lack of any
major political enemies were instrumental in securing his position on the
Council.

#NAME Aranil Enreo swordmaster man tall general councilmember council member pcouncil
#ALIGN 500 0
#DESCRIPTION Aranil Enreo is, like most of the nobility in Earendam, a tall man, with
sharply chiseled features.  Unlike most of those who grow soft from the ease
of city life, however, Aranil is quite fit, particularly for a man nearing
his middle years.  Aranil's face is free from wrinkle or line, but his hair,
which he keeps bound behind his head, is a deep gray.  

Aranil sits on the Patrician's Council, the most powerful body in Earendam
outside of the Patrician himself.  The youngest scion of the Enreo house,
Aranril traveled to Ilodaiya to train as a swordmaster in his formative
years, honing his already substantial natural abilities to become a master
of his art.  Upon he returned to Earendam, he became an officer in the
armies of the city, winning a decisive series of victories in a series of
battles marking the end of the Third Kankoran War.  Prompted to the rank of
general, he rapidly rose in the ranks of Earendam's forces, until he was
eventually chosen by Danrasad to sit on the Council.

#ALIGN 0 0
#DESCRIPTION Curil Nasen is a short, rotund fellow, of middling height.  Well into
middle age, he is completely bald, and wears a velvet hat to cover his pate.
A bit of a dandy, his clothes are a picture of red velvet and violet silk,
finely tailored to hide his bulk.  He wears a sizable amount of jewelry as
well, most of it quite gaudy, despite being made from precious stones.  

Curil sits on the Patrician's Council, the most powerful body in Earendam
outside of the Patrician himself.  Rumored to be a bastard son of the Nasen
house, he nevertheless was named heir to his families fortunes, which he
plied into attaining a position at court.  He has something of a reputation
of a reveler and a dilettante, but is also known for his golden tongue. 
Amusing his betters, and surprising his peers with his gifts, he has risen
to become the diplomatic advisor to the Patrician.

#NAME Qenlea Ryeleandra ethron woman willow pstrumpet willowy green hottie lady
#ALIGN 0 0
#DESCRIPTION Qenlea Ryeleandra is an ethron woman, quite obviously in the prime of her
youth.  Slightly tall for an ethron, she is just over five feet in height. 
She is clad in a skirt of metallic bronze, slit up the side to expose her
long, graceful legs.  She wears a top of similar material, which follows the
lines of her body up to her bodice, where it accentuates her ample bosom. 
She drapes a shawl of white silk around her shoulders, letting the ends
dangle to the edge of her willowy hips.  Her deep green skin highlights the
colors she has chosen, and her features are refined, rather than the rugged
look one sees of most ethron.  She smiles mischievously, and her soulful
brown eyes are alight with what merriment she finds in the moment.  

Qenlea is quite popular at the Patrician's Court, having a somewhat storied
history.  Orphaned as a small child, she was adopted by one of Earendam's
noble families, who found her on the edge of their estate.  Raised at court,
she married a wealthy and noble suitor at a young age, only to suffer
tragedy when he died of illness.  Despite these adversities, she has assumed
the role as head of her husband's house, and is once again popular at the
court, due to both her political connections and cheerfulness in the face of
tragedy.

scabbards, neither of which ever seem to leave his sight.  

A member of one of Ilodaiya's noble houses, Jaril is currently the city's
diplomatic representative here in Earendam.  Unlike the majority of aelin,
Jaril is one of the few who has foresworn the insular life of most of his
people, choosing instead to dabble in the politics of the Dantaron river

imposing man, with sharp, hawk-like features and steely grey eyes, unclouded
by age.  His hair is a fine white, though his face is lined without seeming

years, presiding over a return to prosperity and expansion in Earendam.  

A scion of the ancient house of Elinstad, he was named Patrician after a
number of short-lived politically weak leaders had come into the position. 
A scholar and an artist, he surprised the city by proving his decisive
leadership and his prompt military action and victory in the Third Kankoran
War.  Following this, he acted to reestablish some of Earendam's ancient
trade routes, leading to a gradual expansion in trade and the current period
of prosperity.

#DESCRIPTION As the second to rule the Port Town of Gaald, Tanar has expanded the
town's influence as a port greatly from the times of his father, Hadrar
Gaald.  His solidly built frame was honed handling cargo on the docks he so
skillfully commands, learning, in his youth, all the intricacies of sea
trade and sailing.  He was also trained by the great warrior Firalmol in his
youth, thus he is masterful with weaponry as well.  In the years since, he
has led the defense of the Gaald region against the undead blight on the
southern borders, and has become an able and experienced military commander.

#DESCRIPTION Relandas Indatand is a tall elderly man, with sharp, hawk-like features
and steely grey eyes, unclouded by age.  His hair is a fine white, though
his face is lined without seeming ancient.  His armor and weapons are plain
and unadorned, but of the sort that is very serviceable in capable hands. 
While dressed like a common soldier, his imposing bearing is unmistakably
that of one accustomed to command.  

He appears to be recuperating from serious injuries.  Several vivid red
scars mar his cheek, and he favors one leg as he stands or walks.

curved form of a scimitar.  Instead, each blade has a number of shorter
spurs jutting out from it, making it appear more metal tree than individual
blade.  Popular in Ashta Harrud, the blade is preferred by gladiators, but
also sees use in the personal guards of various merchant houses.

#LORE The Rod of Dimarro has been the symbol of Earendam's power and authority
for almost its entire history.  Widely known as a symbol of harmony and
order, the Rod is said to bear little love for those who would unmake what
its power represent.  

Dimarro is quite potent as a magical artifact in its own right, but those
who would dare to wield this symbol of Earendam without the permission of
its liege might do well to tread warily.

half long and about an inch in diameter.  Perfectly smooth and free of any
marking, it nevertheless fits easily in the hand.  The material appears to
be marble, but the rod, rather than changing with the nearby temperature,
seems to maintain a steady warmth.  

A legendary artifact of Earendam, the Rod is considered the symbol of the
Patrician's leadership.  In legend, the Rod was a gift from the caladarans
to the Republic upon its inception.  A sage of that period prophesied that
the Republic would not fall until wielded by the hand of man.  The first
Patrician, Corvandil, wielded the Rod of Dimarro as a symbol of this new
order, bringing an end to much of the old system of government in Earendam,
if not its traditions.  Rumored to have eerie powers relating to maintaining
peace and harmony in its presence, the Rod remains the most well-known of
the trappings of the Patrician.

to great effect in battle.  The ring stayed with Sydonus until he met his

After that, the ring's history is somewhat murky, but is believe to have
been worn by a kankoran berserker.  The berserker and his tribe encroached

Sydonus, the archmage Phandaal, and the Guardian Skrinlare.  

What little is known about the sword's history before the Sundering points
to it as a warrior's weapon, born by ancient alatharya swordmasters.  The
sword's powers seem to reflect a warrior's needs -- while bearing it, one
can travel in most any environment, at any time, and anywhere.  

After it was returned to mortal eyes, the sword was born by the Guardian
Skrinlare, who wielded it to great effect against his enemies.  As one of
the relatively few shuddeni among the Guardians, he was already widely
feared, but was doubly so when wielding this sword.  

It is known that Skrinlare lost the blade to the Raiders of Twilight,
whereupon it was born by the swordmaster Rascyc, lieutenant of the feared
highlord Shiyul.  

Rascyc bore the sword until his death, but records of its presence vanish
after that.  It is suspected that it was taken by thieves, who later fell to
the Earendam guard, and hence delivered to the palace.

After finding the crown, Phandaal was often seen wrapped in the white light
of sanctuary, despite being a practitioner of the void, so that it least is
one facet of this artifact's power.  Phandaal bore the crown until his
ascendancy under the aegis of the gods of knowledge (some accounts have him
building some sort of machine that granted immortality, others have him
being taken up from his wizard's tower by the hand of the gods), and willed

Scorned for his eccentric habits (Sligura often used the sewers of Earendam
as a hiding spot, resulting in his title, 'The Lord of Rats'), Sligura
nevertheless became an extremely powerful archmage, able to stand toe to toe

rodents and other vermin in the course of magical experiments, gradually
gathering their vital energy to be bound into a focus for mystical energy. 


The garish ring which bears Sligura's name is almost as hideous as the
habits of its master, but it is almost certain that it is the fruits of his
unwholesome experiments with rodentkind.

#LORE The archmage Belerin is widely regarded as one of the most powerful
archmages of water to live in recent memory.  Widely respected as a healer,
he was also a formidable adventurer.  

Drawn by the lure of new knowledge in the wilds, Belerin plied his craft in
the area surrounding the Dantaron River valley, winning aclaim for doing
everything from stopping a prince of the elemental plane of air to facing
off against the mighty Sothmogga in his astral prison.  

As powerful as Belerin was, his ways and his magic were extremely subtle,
and all of his creations were made with an eye to this philosophy.  

As wise as he was talented, Belerin was also a powerful force for balance,
and was unwilling to reap the rewards of his adventure if it meant
endangering the world at large.  Rumors are rife that he once held the heart
of Sothmogga in his hands, but chose to destroy it rather than allow its
power to be unleashed on the world.  

Belerin's final fate is not recorded -- some say he was taken into the
heavens to serve as a servant of the gods of knowledge and wisdom.  Others
say that he left the material plane in search of knowledge elsewhere, while
more mundane accounts have him establishing a conclave of healers and
scholars far in the south of Avendar.  

This staff is most likely Belerin's greatest lasting achievement (his
spellbooks being lost to the ages).  After his disappearance, the staff was
found floating along the Dantaron, where it was found by a small village
boy.  Rumor, magic, and stories followed the staff, but it is clear that not
many have truly understood its power.  

Fragmentary reports indicate that the staff requires time to bond itself to
its wearer, but then achieves greater potency.  One story tells of the
archmage Sagenar, who despite his mastery of the black arts of the void,
could only cause the staff to produce a spring, by chanting the words
'Tadelb No Azrad'.

world, reverted to their natures, and by and large scattered to the four
winds.  

The shining example of cooperation between the powers, Kor Thrandir, was
left as the only visible sign that they had once all been allies.  The
senate of Earendam, seeing that they were increasingly unable to maintain
direct control of holdings in the Brintors, decided to take action.  They
divided up the Brintors into several region, giving direct control to
nobility who would pay tribute and remain nominal vassals of Earendam. 
Along with these agreements, the nobility ceded the Brintors would maintain
the roads through the mountains, as well as acting to settle them whenever
possible, to act as a bulwark against any potential future shuddeni
incursions.  

One well known such territory is the barony of Krilin, which persists to
this day in the form of the city which bears the same name.  Another
territory lay on a mountainous spur of the Brintors, which jutted down along
the edge of the Uthlin.  Located near an old shuddeni outpost, it was
considered a perfect location for new fortifications.  And so it was that
the Duchy of Paelaran came into existence.  At first, the duchy flourished,
and its people lived in a tower on the coast of the Uthlin, trading and
fishing along the eastern part of the sea.  

The fortunes of the age were not with the people of Paelaran, though, and
their numbers dwindled.  A plague ravaged their tower city in the second
century after its founding, and a chilling of the climate in the region
ravaged their economy in the fourth.  During the first kankoran war,
Paelaran was captured and sacked by the main body of the kankoran horde, and
most of its people fled to Earendam.  In the chaos following the fall of the
Republic, Paelaran was abandoned for some time, but eventually resettled. 
It retained only a fraction of its former glory, and its halls lay empty. 
Lacking the population to support a standing army, the tower's remaining
nobility took up the very dangerous task of training the griffins who
roosted in the aeries near the city.  Little is known of the actual taming
of the beasts (as griffinriders even in the early days guarded their secrets
from outsiders), but it is suspected some power of air or spirit is
involved.  The griffinriders enjoyed a period of fame where they were the
stuff of legend, but Paelaran still lacked the citizenry to regain its
former glory.  

By the time of the third kankoran war, Earendam called upon the
griffinriders to help them in battle against a group of marauding human and
kankoran mercenaries in the hill country of the Rirro Jagka, further east of
the Uthlin and Earendam.  Discharging their ancient debt, the griffinriders
helped turn an even battle into a rout of the opposing forces.  

Unfortunately for the griffinriders, the other arm of the mercenary army
took the opportunity to attack the undefended Paelaran.  The tower was
sacked, burned, and razed, as the mercenaries prepared for the next battle. 
Returning to the city, the riders came upon the recently unprepared
mercenaries, and drove them into the Uthlin.  

Grief-stricken at the fate of their people, the griffinriders swore to
protect that region of the Uthlin for all time.  Unwilling to live in a
centralized location again, they took to living with the griffins that they
had trained, becoming a part of the ecosystem of the mountains.  

Today, the griffinriders mainly keep to themselves, but actively police the
area near the Uthlin and their section of the mountains, hunting wild game
to feed both themselves and the griffins they tend.  In most cases,
griffinriders are descendants of the nobility of Paelaran, although some
adventurers join their ranks after deeds of exceptional nobility and daring,
and after they have proven they can bond with the great griffins.

with the building.  Northward, the lawn continues in a similar fashion until
it meets a barrier made from interlocking hedges.  To the east, a high

of the palace.  This particular locale provides an exceptional view of the
palace, whose gold dome rises above its marble colonnade.  From here, the
palace seems perfectly symmetrical, its golden hemisphere and diamond-shaped
base perfectly centered around an imaginary azimuth from north to south. 
While the patio opening rises to the south, there is a gap in the hedges to
the north, clearly marking the beginning of the maze.

#DESCRIPTION The Day of Two Dawns came at the darkest time in the War of Night, after
the city had nearly been taken, and the army routed in the Trap of Valandas.
A battle was fought at dawn on the southern shores of the Uthlin, and
Earendam's army was forced to withdraw to the walls of the city, with the
shuddeni in hot pursuit.  

As night fell and the shuddeni prepared for an assault of the city, the
ch'taren vanguard appeared, blasting forth with their magics of light and
spirit, sailing across the Uthlin on a fleet of scavenged sailing ships.  

Expecting an easy victory at night, when their powers were greatest, the
shuddeni were instead decimated by the ch'taren, who brought a second dawn
as they drew upon the powers of spirit to defeat the shuddeni.  

Here in this mural, the ch'tarens are painted as beautiful and angelic, with
bolts of light striking down the shuddeni before them.  At their head is
Curalin Tyra, the leader of his people during the war.

#KEYWORDS  third
#DESCRIPTION The most effort has been expended on this third scene, which is a
rendition of the so-called 'Trap of Valandas', perhaps one of the most
famous battles of the War of Night.  Near the midpoint of the war, following
the fall of Var Bandor, human forces led a daring offensive against the
shuddeni, attempting to drive them back beneath the surface of Avendar.  

The dance card of heroes at the Trap was prodigious.  From their storied
general, Vysara, Envarinon the Blade Master, the healer Iliraya, to the
famous Lystaran, Earendam fronted what is quite possibly the largest human
army in recorded history.  

Unfortunately for the forces of Earendam and the Army of the Golden Hand,
this offensive was doomed from the beginning.  Betrayed by the archmage
Kaagn, the shuddeni were prepared for the massive human onslaught, and
prepared their own army of demons and chaja for a carefully laid trap.  

In the mural, the human army is portrayed in all its glory and strength, led
by knights in gold armor, backed by the army of Earendam, marching defiantly
into the darkness of the shuddeni juggernaut.

#DESCRIPTION The second scene in the mural is of the Battle of Aramril, a victory in
the War of Night.  Vast ranks of shuddeni swell in the hills of the
Brintors, their black banners darkening the ground, and the blades of their
chaja slaves glistening with wet blood.  In the middle of the scene is the
tower of Aramril, which is guarded by a legion of Champions, all clad in
white.  

Overhead, an immense black dragon is ridden by an aelin woman, and is flies
among a contigent of black-robed aelin, their hands and eyes crackling with
dark magic.  The dragon's darkness is countered by a woman on the top of the
tower, who is no doubt the legendary Amiraiya, female templar and leader of
the Champions.  A white bolt from the heavens surrounds her, enveloping her
in a protective halo.  

The faces of the Champions are resolute, each engraved with the look of men
and women whose time to die has come, and who have made their peace with
death.  Beyond the hills of the Brintors marches a force from Earendam,
lightening the otherwise dark mood of the scene.

The armies of Earendam are seen as too late to save Var Bandor, but still

Lithling Valley and gain easy access to their own city.

#KEYWORDS  mural
#DESCRIPTION The murals in this area have one primary theme -- the fall of the old
Republic, and the rise of the reign of the patricians in Earendam.  

Dark, accusing colors paint the scene of the infamous 'Last Senate', who
fled the city upon news of an advancing kankoran horde near the end of the
first Kankoran War.  Each of the Senators is a craven, cowering figure, and
they are seen departing Earendam with the treasures of the city carried in
tow.  

Outside the city wall, an angry bedlam of snarling, red-furred kankoran
warriors approaches.  The people of Earendam gather on the walls, fearful,
until a noble figure appears.  Corvandil, the first Patrician, leads the
people in defense of their city, bravely standing at the forefront of
battle.  

The kankorans are driven back, despite great expense to the city's northern
expanse.  After the battle scenes, the city is slowly rebuilt, set amidst a
series of grim depictions of the fates of the Last Senate.  To a man, each
senator meets with a gruesome end.  One is hung by his own golden belt,
another stabbed in the back by his own servant, yet another devoured by a
package of savage kankorans, and most brought to trial in the court of the
Patrician.  The last of their deaths occurs near the end of the mural, which
terminates in a gold sun setting over a rebuilt and revitalized Earendam.

#NAME In the Patrician's Court
#DESCRIPTION The Patrician's Court is the center of legal and political activity
within Earendam.  The court is designed around a high, golden chair, seated
in the epicenter of a vast circular chamber.  To either side of the chair
are seats for the various members of Earendam's council, all of which are on
the same raised dais as the Patrician's seat, if at a somewhat reduced
height.  High overhead, a golden dome arches upwards, terminating in an
oculus designed to illuminate the chair at midday.  

In front of the dais is a red rug, made from a thin, elegantly woven silk. 
Radiating out from the center are carved stone benches, which follow
diagonal lines to the southeast and southwest.  Before the chair is a block
of obsidian, which is tall enough to act as a stand for those who come to
the court.  Standing behind the dais, in the northeast and west corners of
the chamber, are two tall statues, which are positioned to look down
directly onto the court.  An aisle leads out through the stone benches to
the east, west, and south.

#DESCRIPTION The oculus is located high above the court, at the exact geometric center

when addressing the assembly.

#DESCRIPTION This obsidian block, known as the Stone of Phailipea, is a recreation of
one of humanity's oldest artifacts.  The original stone was unearthed on the
banks of the Dantaron, where it was used in the judgement rites of ancient
human tribes.  It survived the War of Fire, and was later used in the
Republic, where those who addressed the Senate stood before the stone.  

Unfortunately, the original stone was lost or destroyed in the First
Kankoran War, and it was not until the reign of the Patrician Danrasad that
this replica was constructed.  Now, all those who come to petition the
Patrician stand before the stone, as they are under the symbolic and often
literal judgement of his law.

its spherical course beginning near the wall to the northwest and arching
upwards to the southeast.  The walls of the chamber are carved from solid
marble, divided into sections by pillars made from the same stone. 
Underfoot, a mosaic made up of precious and semiprecious stones makes up the
magically smoothed floor.  

This part of the chamber is located to the northwest of the Patrician's
Chair, and most of the area is taken up with decorative plants and a large
statue.  Roughly twice the height of a normal human, the statue is of the
god Iandir, who stands overlooking the center of the court to the southeast.
The chamber continues to the south and east, where exits are visible in the
chamber walls.

#KEYWORDS  iandir statue
#DESCRIPTION This statue is shaped from a single block of light brown marble, hewn
magically from the Brintors.  The subject of the statue is Iandir, portrayed
in his guise as lawgiver.  A tall, stern figure, Iandir carries a tablet in
the crook of his arms, and a scale in the other.  While not formally a
patron deity of Earendam, his long worship by the humans and caladarans in
the Dantaron and Aragol river valley have ensured that he is highly revered.
Having risen further in promise under the reign of the Patricians, Iandir's
statue is a gift from the Glallian School, perfectly shaped by artists who
are also scholars of earth.

#DESCRIPTION The Patrician's Court is a vast, circular chamber, built over what was
once the chambers of the senate.  Overhead is the golden dome of the palace,
its spherical course beginning near the wall to the south and arching
upwards to the north.  The walls of the chamber are carved from solid
marble, divided into sections by pillars made from the same stone. 
Underfoot, a mosaic made up of precious and semiprecious stones makes up the
magically smoothed floor.  

Visible in the center of the room is the Patrician's Chair, from which he
presides over the legal and diplomatic business of Earendam.  The chair
stands on a raised podium, and has seats to either side for various members
of the council to sit in attendance.  This area is somewhat further north of
the court, however, and located behind the court.  Located between two large
statues in the east and west, it mainly serves an entry to the Patrician's
quarters to the north.

#NAME Northeast Corner of the Patrician's Court
#DESCRIPTION The Patrician's Court is a vast, circular chamber, built over what was
once the chambers of the senate.  Overhead is the golden dome of the palace,
its spherical course beginning near the wall to the northeast and arching
upwards to the southwest.  The walls of the chamber are carved from solid
marble, divided into sections by pillars made from the same stone. 
Underfoot, a mosaic made up of precious and semiprecious stones makes up the
magically smoothed floor.  

This part of the chamber is located to the northwest of the Patrician's
Chair, and most of the area is taken up with decorative plants and a large
statue.  About twice the height of a human, the statue is of the god Jolinn,
and carved out of the grey marble of the Brintors.  The statue faces
southwest, overlooking the court in the southwest.  The chamber continues to
the west and south, where exits are visible in the wall.  

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  statue
#DESCRIPTION Jolinn's statue is carved by hand from grey marble, drawn from the
Brintors.  The statue was originally carved by chisel, and now these mark
the passage of time on the piece.  Worn smooth in other places and slightly
chipped in others, the statue is easily centuries old, and perhaps even
millennia old.  

The statue bears its age with dignity, though, and portrays Jolinn in his
aspect as a stately general.  His ageless features are set in resolution
determination, and to his side he carries the legendary Sapphire Spear. 
Great attention has been paid to the cast of Jolinn's eyes and the set of
his face, which seems somehow gentle, despite the martial tone of the piece.

The room's bed is carved from solid oak, but is inset with quartz, zircon,
and the bedposts are tipped with diamond.  Underfoot, the floor is tiled
with squares of glass, magically enchanted to be unbreakable.  A similar
glass cover provides surface for a pine desk, that has knobs made from
coin-sized diamonds.  A slight breeze blows through the room, producing
soft, melodic tones from the chandelier.  The only exit from the room lies

soft browns, and the decorations are in the room are all statuettes and
pillars.  The bed is covered in soft cushions, but its frame and posts are
all smooth, magically-shaped white marble.  Light in the chamber comes from
ornate candelabras, which are affixed to stands beside the room's desk.  The
only exit from the chamber lies through an ironwood door, which opens to the

#KEYWORDS  statuette
#DESCRIPTION The form of these statuettes is quite unusual.  Rather than being the
strictly realistic artworks which are so common among Earendam's historical
artistic traditions, they are instead the result of experiments with magic
and the creation of art, such as that often seen produced by the Glallian
school.  

These statues are studies in form, rather than content, and shape marble in
exotic, almost alien ways.  One statuette in particular is quite singular,
portraying a roughly tree-like shape, whose branches fork into smaller and
smaller structures, growing too small to see near the tips.  The bifurcating
branches are nevertheless quite dense, and twist and wind to almost
completely fill the space of the statue.

is the most grand, generally being sets of full plate, generally some
precious metal magically enchanted to be stronger than the finest iron. 
Armor from nearer the present period tends to be a bit more loose less
bulky, with magical enchantments allowing them to provide just as much
defense as their precursors.

#NAME The Patrician's Studio
#DESCRIPTION This large, rectangular room serves as the Patrician's private studio. 
Trained in the Glallian School, the studio bears silent witness to an
individual quite dedicated to their art.  Several large works in marble are
on stands around the chamber, most of them in varying stages of completion. 
Beside most of them are clay models, built as visual aids for carving and
shaping the larger stone pieces.  Other than a wooden stool or two, the
chamber is surprisingly unfurnished.  The only exit from the chamber is
through a stone door to the east.

#NAME Patio Overlooking the North Lawn
#DESCRIPTION This raised patio is just outside the Patrician's palace, north of the
portcullis that leads to its interior.  From the patio, most of the north
lawn is visible, as well as the famous hedge maze known as the 'Sakmi
Sjijia'.  Various comfortable cushioned chairs sit on the patio, along with
tables for light snacks and wine.  The edge of the patio is surrounded by a
low marble wall, but there are breaks in the wall in all directions, which
turn into stairs leading down to the lawn.  Behind the patio is the bulk of
the palace, columns and marble siding supporting its gold dome, whose full
extent is not visible this close to it.

#NAME Entrance to the Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia
#DESCRIPTION This is a roughly square region lies near the southern entrance to the
Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia.  The maze is made primarily from great hedges,
warded to prevent travel through their boundary.  Smaller shrubs and plants
also dot the landscape of the maze, interwoven in a fine net of greenery
with the hedges.  On the whole, this makes the area of the maze outside of
the entrance a confused tangle, with the way into the depths of the maze not
readily apparent.  There is a break in the plants to the south, allowing
exit towards the palace and its grounds.

#NAME In the Sakmi Sjijia
#DESCRIPTION The Sakmi Sjijia, the 'Secret Heart', lies in the middle of the maze that
bears its name.  A tall, magnificent tree grows in the center of the
clearing.  Its leaves are of many colors, and a wide variety of fruits and
flowers grow on its limbs.  Two tall, marble obelisks stand near the base of
the tree, sheltered by the bolls and roots.  

Rough, unpolished rocks trace geometric patterns on the ground, radiating
out from the tree, and partitioning the Sakmi Sjijia into several grassy
regions.  In one of these regions is a sundial; in another, a quiet pool
supported in a cairn.  All around this place are the hedges of the maze,
which are a confusing melange of green, leafy plants and the taller hedges.

#KEYWORDS  sundial
#DESCRIPTION Along with being one of the oldest timekeeping devices, the sundial is
also a symbol of druidical nature-worship.

#KEYWORDS  tree gift firiel
#DESCRIPTION The tree is truly magnificent, and is known as the 'Sa Ec Shanc', the
'Gift of Firiel' brought to Earendam by the first caladarans.  Alleged to be
a scion of the mother tree Firiel, the tree bears all manner of fruits and
flowers, its base sheltering two large marble obelisks.  

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  obelisk obelisks
#DESCRIPTION These two obelisks are worn and weathered, having stood the test of time
here in the Sakmi Sjijia.  Both are carved from marble, and topped with
tetrahedrons, once sharp, but now worn dull with long exposure to the
elements.  

Carved faintly into the left obelisk is the word 'Aramril', and carved into
the right is the word 'Salyra'.  Both are decorated with the runes of
ancient human death rites, so old as to make it almost believable that these
obelisks truly mark the final resting place of the fabled templar and
scholar.  

There is a small etching on the back of the right obelisk.

#DESCRIPTION This topiary is located at one end of the Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia. 
Hedges walls hide the rest of the maze, interspersed with a thick web of
greenery which obscures the true exit from the area.  Growing in this
circular sward of grass is a topiary, composed of fantastically shaped
hedges and bushes arrayed with geometric precision.  They have recently been
trimmed, and creatures can be discerned in the shapes of the bushes: There
is a dragon, a griffin, a great titan, a huge misshapen chaja, and several
human figures.

Certainly, powerful magic is present here -- inscribed on the floor is an
enormous magical seal, which traces an intricate pattern about most of the
room.  Sealed coffers are affixed in niches around various parts of the
room, magically holding their contents secure.  

One of the coffers here is open, not yet full and magically sealed.
