most of its kind, but a number of things seem askew about the demon.  Most
noticeably, it wears a pair of miniature wire-rimmed spectacles, and rather
than being supported by the action of its wings, it floats due to the
influence of some magical spell.

from its fleshy cage.  Extending forward from the demon's face is a gaping,
canine jaw, lined with a double-layer of smashed, jagged incisors.  Bounding
forward with each step, the Orzub's claws seem to whistle through the air
with ominous speed.

capable of snapping a man in half.  The gharku's hulking weight rests upon
short, squat legs, each one bent ever so slightly at the joint.  The legs
extend onward into bony, clawed feet.  

A seemingly human skull, wrapped tightly in grey, decaying skin, rests atop
a stick of a neck, protruding only slightly forward from its hulking torso. 
Its jaw is set into a permanent grin, jagged and broken teeth, thrusting
forth from shriveled lips.  Bloodshot eyestalks erupt from the gharku's
empty sockets, endlessly swinging about in search of prey.

paleness implaceably unwholesome.  The limbs of the beast end in sets of
piercing and rending claws while its pinched, impish face sports a grinning
mouth of jagged bone spurs.  A pair of rapidly flapping wings support the
creature, the membranes of its bat-like members a strikingly unreflective
black.  Discerning these features is made all the more difficult by the
j'nakra's only semi-visible nature.  

The j'nakra never is fully visible, pieces of its body always seeming to
fade into the air.  Even as the limbs shimmer back into existance, others
fade creating an unsettling picture of semi-intagibility.  The beating of
its wings and the tittering of its deadly mouth suddenly cease on occasion
as the sources of the sound disappear, the ensuing quiet soon shattered as
its flesh continues its dance through the ether.

unsettling clatter as they swing dangerously about, running over and through
the Nvae'gra's flesh, and drag along the ground.  

Beneath the shroud of iron, twin points of glowing red smoulder in the

away from the face of this creature, clinging to the lower jaw tautly,
attempting to hold fast to its last, razor-toothed purchase.

note a curious lack of eyes.  What truly catches your eye, however, is the
tail.  

Atop a tail rising five feet, a wicked looking stinger is perched.  The
cruelly barbed point drips a vile crimson ichor as it twitches left and
right, seeking flesh.  The volume of the chittering seems to rise and fall
with the stingers movements.

prowls as he moves, and occasionally darts toward his destination with an

#DESCRIPTION The black and riven offshoot of some ghastly tree protrudes from the

into the air.  The bark of the malignant plant has both the color and
texture of charred flesh - a tortured network of ebon ridges which writhe
atop a tender, pink interior.  The gnarled skin is studded here and there
with ruddy, weeping ulcers, in each of which gathers a putrid-smelling,
crimson sediment.  Several large lumps can also be seen beneath this carnal
membrane, slowly inching their way upward.  Closer inspection reveals these
to be detritus from a variety of corpses - a skull here, a pelvic bone
there, and even an entire humanoid form enveloped in one gluttonous bulge,
part of its dead face leering blankly from a rent in bark.  

The tree itself bears several branches, which extend from the main bole at
irregular intervals.  These naked limbs, slender as willow-wands, rise from
the tree and then hang downwards at their tips, appearing for all the world
like the fleshy rods of some diabolic angler.  And the gruesome catch of
dead things, now shorn of skin and muscle, passes along these limbs to hang,
then drop, like ripe fruit, to the ground below, forming a wide annulus of
carrion about the tree's base.  

At the very apex of the demon tree hangs a bulbous nodule; a small, sickly
fruit, its translucent skin a deep, asphyxiated purple.

#DESCRIPTION A hideous being of twisted, veined muscle lurches here, radiating a sense
of power and authority.  Its skin is a sickly, glazed black, and dotted with
faint scarring remnants of sores.  Its entire front bulges outwards with
hairless muscle, scarred with scabbed-over wounds of various size and depth.
Its arms, thick and powerful, extend from his sides, each clutching a
several-headed whip of razor-sharp barbs and thin-wired tips.  Its lower
body descends into two potent-looking limbs of the same black flesh, which
hook backwards in a way similar to that of a goat.  

His head is a most horrific perversion of nature itself.  Thick and bulbous,
it embodies the characteristics of an assortment of animal-forms, and yet
never seems to decide on one for certain.  Instead, the form of the head
twists and writhes upon itself, removing eyes, replacing snouts, and closing
over gills continously as it glares about its surroundings.  Although never
settling upon a single form for more than an instant, one thing is constant;
the taskmaster's visage remains hideous in the extreme.

complete with four independent arms.  Covering its body is a hard green
exoskeleton, and prehensile pincer-like hands are located at the end of each
of its lanky arms.  

Along with its blood-red compound eyes, the syndic has an impressive bundle
of antennas sprouting from the two nodes on its head.  The creature is
largely free of superfluous motion, except the constant twitching of the
antennae in response to otherworldly stimuli.  It wears no formal armor, but
is draped in fine purple silks of its office.  Each of its arms bears either
a sword or a shield, which it holds at ready.

alien to this plane of existence.  Small worm-like tentacles dot his body,
grey worms covered with sucker-like protuberances.  Breaking the integrity
of his flesh, jaws both large and small clatter noisily as Isetaton floats
about the room.  Thin eyestalks which sprout from around his neck scan all
directions about the demon, while the eyes set in the center of his face are
little more than blackened orbs.

between belching forth curses and insults at nothing in particular.

#DESCRIPTION Rarer among imps are those of their number who have learned a smattering
of matters arcane.  They are typically more intelligent than their brother
imps, which either leads them to these additional powers, or have developed
wit as a result of this magic.  Because of both these traits, they are
almost always powerful within imp society, with many subservient imps
reporting to them.  

These imp sages also occur outside of Vakalis, and often in the service at
the courts of various demon lords.  We mortals can take advantage of these
imp sages when we summon them, often obtaining valuable information about
exotic items or personages.  

Unlike most of their brethren, imp sages are not bound by the Vakalic sign. 
Fancying themselves more intelligent and powerful than normal imps, they
have become ensnared by the powers of the Aklaju Hieroglyph, engraved with
lines of black charcoal.  Mercenary in nature, they will often demand a
price in gold coins.

#DESCRIPTION Another commonly occurring species of imp is the so-called filchling. 
Reviled even among imps, they often occupy the bottom of what passes for
social structure among the imps.  This is primarily a result of their
skulking, sneaking nature, and their absolutely obsession with hoarding any
valuables they can in their jealously guarded warrens.  

Their main function is as scouts of spies for competing for whichever other
imp or other powerful demon who can buy their favor.  We of mortal flesh can
bind the demons to do what is perhaps their true calling -- theft.  

Filchlings are summoned under the aegis of the Vakalic sign, and bound by
powdered silver.  True to their natures, they typically demand jewelry to
satisfy their never-ending lust for precious metals.

#DESCRIPTION The most basic, or common (the distinction seems superfluous) sort of imp

with small, functioning wings, and sharp claws.  

Often used as messengers by demonic overlords, the Vakalic imp can be
favorably employed by mortal scholars as well.  Due to their connection to
the void, such imps can travel great distances in a short span of time, and
can be cajoled into transporting items or messages by skilled mages.  

True to their names, the Vakalic imps are conjured through the use of the
Vakalic sign, inscribed in charcoal.  They are quite fond of mortal
clothing, and will often perform their task for a simple set of shoes. 
(There is no accounting for the vanities of imps!)

blasted ground, riddled with warrens and shallow tunnels.  The ruins of some
city, often called by the name of the place, squats in a central hollow.  

Almost exclusively, Vakalis is populated by imps.  Little enough is there to
draw larger classes of demons, so the imps, traditionally at the bottom of
the infernal pecking order, infested the place, and spend their time
bickering over obscure matters of hierarchy.  

The imps common in a diverse array of types, being specialized to various
functions.  They are most commonly in the service of greater demonic powers,
but, as we shall see, can be quite useful when conjured by mortal scholars,
typically called by lesser rituals of power.

move in pulsing and throbbing hordes through warrens which lead to a
decaying city on the surface.  

Of all shapes and sizes, the imps chatter at each other, the combination of
their voices combining in mad harmony.  Imps are called away by larger
demons to serve, and establish a rigid pecking order which is more than
apparent in their constant and often violent behavior towards each other.  

No exit seems to lead from Vakalis, but burned in the lifeless ground near
the place is a symbolic, which can only be the fabled Vakalic sign.  Imps
cluster about it, worshipping it.  

Inexorably, the view within the cube draws you to the Sign, and it expands
to fill the entire image.  Transfixed, you are unable to look away as it
burns itself into your mind, warping your very soul by its presence.  










And with that, the image ends just as quickly as it began.


The cube is now a discolored black, and offers nothing in the way of visions.

#DESCRIPTION This brings us to the final section, which concerns the control
of demons once they have been summoned and their price has been
paid. There are really two categories of demons -- those that perform
specific services, and then return to the void, and those that stay at the
scholars side, performing in response to his direct commands.

        Of the ones who remain at the side of the scholar, great care
must be taken. They are bound for various periods of time, which is
determined by the relative power of the demon. At the end of this
period, the scholar must infuse the demons binding with more
magical energy, in order to renew his control for an additional
time interval.

        Sadly, each subsequent infusing of energy into the bond
must be greater than the last. Eventually, the scholar will be unable
to pay the cost in magic to renew the bond, it will break, and there
will be dire results. Fortunately, just as there are summoning spells,
magical research has resulted in an equal and opposite spell to
banish demons back to whence they came. Be warned: Not all
demons are eager to return!

#DESCRIPTION When faced with a demon which is the result of a successful
conjuration, there then arises the matter of the Price. For reasons
which elude scholars, this price must be paid in order to bind the
demon to the scholars will. Failure to do so generally results
in unfortunate consequences. 

        The obvious question which arises, of course, is why such
obviously powerful beings would allow themselves to be bound by
we pitiful mortals. In part, we know that the symbols represent
a barrier, or even a trap to demonkind. Still, what compels the demon
to keep once the agreement has been reached?

        It is my belief that while we do have spells which control the
demon, in truth they are not powerful enough to compel their will. Rather,
they are like the token chains that bind a powerful animal. Long ago,
the chains truly bound the creature, but even though they are now more
powerful, they are still restrained by the memory of the chain. Of course,
I do not think this is literally the truth in the case of demonkind. Instead,
I conjecture that either the gods, the ancient alatharya, or some other
powerful entities, took advantage of the inherent rules of the void
to set in place a system of bargains, contracts, and prices that governed
the passage of demons to our world. Those bindings are still in place,
and we tap into them through the use of our elemental magic.

#DESCRIPTION Once a symbol has been inscribed in a particular material, the scholar
must then prepare the magical invocation which will call forth the demon.
In general, there are three tiers of demonic invocation, each more potent,
lengthy, and exhausting than the last.

        It should be clear that the more powerful the ritual, so is the more
potent the demon, but what is less obvious is that the same symbol, and the
same ritual can often be used with different rituals to produce differing
demons.

        Most importantly, though, is the knowledge that not every
combination of ritual, symbol, and ingredient will result in a viable
conjured being. Indeed, moreover, these "dissonant" combinations,
as they are known, tend to have dire effects on the caster. Sometimes,
exotic will be summoned which will turn on the caster [as the pattern
does not truly control them, being at odds with the laws of demonology].
Other casters have been known to simply vanish after such castings,
or leave behind a dessicated corpse, and so forth.

#DESCRIPTION Once the scholar has decided on the symbol he is to use, he then
decides on what material with which to inscribe it. The choice of material
tends toward alchemical in flavor, though typically our knowledge of the
proper ones is jealously guarded, being won through dark divination,
long study with infernal sages, or at last resort apprentices used in
carefully controlled experiments.

        Typical fluids or crushed powders, the materials also vary in
rarity and availability. Common materials, such as charcoal, silver
dust, or the simple powdered bone are often sold in guilds, schools,
or apothecaries. Rarer ingredients, such as the blood of celestial beings
or the ground bones of the undead may be much harder to come by.

        It is this very rarity that make scholars loathe to trivially conjure
demons to do their bidding. In times of crisis, lacking the proper supplies
can be painful, if not lethal, to the caster. This rarity also makes masters
of our craft ill-disposed to reveal ingredients which they might consider
valuable.

#DESCRIPTION The first requirement of any demonic conjuration is of primary
importance. The scholar must first determine the diabolical sign which
holds dominance over the demon that is to be summoned. 

        It is one of the great mysteries of our craft why certain demons
are attracted to, and inevitably, bound by, particular symbols. Certainly,
the symbols which bind a particular demon have some connection to both
the origins and the mystical allegiance of the demon. For instance, it will
often happen that a denizen of the demon city of Logor will be drawn by
sigils and runes native to that place. 

        The theory of this author is that the Symbols are abstract
representations of the true forms and names of demonic life and locales.
The principle of sympathy applies to these forms, and thusly, demonic
life is drawn to and contained by the symbols.

        Unfortunately, the ability to inscribe such symbols is not
a matter of simply memorizing the right angles, distances, curvatures,
and so forth. The scholar must be first find the "prime form" of the symbol,
and then through study and experience burn the memory of it into the very
fabric of its being. The "prime form" of a symbol is not simply a particular
instance -- rather, they are typically the result of unique mystical contact
between our world and the void. For instance, the death of a powerful
demon, or the completion of a truly terrible curse, might leave behind
such a symbol as a residue. That such pure, or prime forms must be
seen and experienced before the void scholar can faithfully replicate them
is only more evidence that they exist on a more abstract plane of
existence.

#DESCRIPTION The Theory and Practice of the Summoning and Binding of Demons

                       Ateghu, Dedicant of the Void


        As most learned are aware, void magic, unlike no other, commands
and draws its power from the sentient denizens of that plane. While the
individual scholar can accomplish impressive feats through the use of
channeling negative energy, the most potent of invocations require that
the scholar of void be capable of summoning and binding demons to his
will. 
        This fact, more than no other, has lead to the unfortunate bias the
practice of void magic has experienced in the past. Skilled practitioners
will realize that just because on has traffic with the denizens of the lower
regions does not imply that one necessarily will become their unwitting
pawn. Of course, this risk, along with the risk of death at the hands of
that which we summon is a real one, and it is the purpose of this work
to introduce journeyman in our craft into the safe and efficacious methods
of controlling such entities. 

        Before the formal training begins, let me give a Warning:
Demons, like all the denizens of the planes of Order, are creatures bound
by Laws. Our control of them is a direct reflection of our capability to
understand and implement our understanding, however imperfect,
of these Laws. Departing from the way of careful, disciplined studies
into the realm of chaotic, random experimentations is to be avoided
at all costs, for in that path lies the way to our own undoing.

hangings are seen admist the wreckage, their fragmented scenes showing
moments from brighter days in the history of the Champions.  The courtyard
of the tower opens to the north.  Bloodstains and powdery dustmarks smear
the walls, and a charred stink hangs in the heavy air.

courtyard.  Chinks in the arched ceiling overhead show spots of light
through the cracks and holes in the tower structure above.  A fountain,
partially hidden by fallen stone blocks and still showing black scorch marks
from the shuddeni attack, lies empty in the center of the courtyard.  A
skull has been smashed against the northeastern wall, dried gore spattered
outwards from the point of impact and fragments of bone lying in a pile on the
floor beneath.  Musty air smells of smoke and blood, the atmosphere tense
and uneasy.

south, and two smaller arches lead north and east.  The dome is, for the

a stone giant, or even a dragon.  Supported by enormous tons of stone, the
Vault appears designed to survive a very large amount of punishment.  The
once-pristine marble is scorched a pure ash-black, coated with a thick layer
of grimy cinders, and broad cracks lace the walls and ceiling.  An enormous
pentacle, bloodstained and spattered with gore, has been carved deeply into
the hard floor.  Runes all around the room lie dead and dark, foul symbols
and counter-runes obscuring each one.  To the north, a charred archway leads
out onto the open, ruined dome.

#DESCRIPTION Thin beams of light stream through the shutters of the windows looking

completely block the view however and to the north you can see the vast
realm of Avendar spread out like a beautiful carpet, from the green forests
of Nendor to the distant blue sparkle of the Uthlin Ocean.  West the shimmer
of a bridge of mist catches your eye, and east lies a view of the opposite
tower, glowing in the sunlight.  The shuddeni can overlook the cloudy
expanse to the south for signs of invaders.  The surface of the large desk
in the room is completely covered with battle plans and supply orders from
the front.  The furnishings of this room are imported from the undercities
of the Shuddeni, both plush and extravagant to serve the war-leaders of the
Scourge.  A twisting staircase leads back into the palace.

by a great fire.  The floor has been swept clean of the ashes, however, and
several manacles have been secured with metal bolts driven deep into the
rock.  A multifaceted crystal glows with dull red light, illuminating the
room.  A large iron-banded safe sits in one corner.  To the west, a
doorless arch opens out onto a ruined, blasted dome.

#KEYWORDS  portal
#DESCRIPTION A large chamber spreads before you.  Braziers have been lit in different
parts of the chamber, and dark smoke roils forth, filling the air with ashes
and stinging your eyes.  Stone pillars rise in the middle of the room,
carved with dark runes and horrific images.  Four passages spread from the
corners of this chamber, leading to the altars that pay tribute to the
principles the shuddeni worship.
  
[Exits: north east south west]
(Invis) (Translucent) The high priest of Yithoul stands directing the work of his underlings.
