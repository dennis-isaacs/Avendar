horrendous paunch is plainly visible.  The wrinkled flabs of gray skin droop
over the edge of his overly-tight belt, protected only by the filmy gauze of
his tunic.  His legs, in comparison, seem little more than twigs, barely
able to support his amorphous bulk.  His eyeless gaze seems perpetually
focused upon the pair of dice within his hands.

#ALIGN -500 0
#DESCRIPTION Malenrion Filarwen sits here in well-earned repose, a slight paunch
accentuated by his bent, aged shoulders, now slumped into a hunch from his
advanced years.  Pale green skin is cobwebbed with a fine network of lines,
and wisps of pale hair seem ghostly and insubstantial.  His eyes, however,
remain bright and sharp, their dark irises alert and perceptive.  

The ethron formerly held the position of Highlord for many decades, serving
with wile and tact over several generations of active Raiders.  His
political machinations and interpersonal maneuverings, both with mortal and
demon, served the interests of the Canyon and himself admirably for some
time.  Known and feared in his time as a dedicant of the greed-avatar
Khamurn, he still bears the sigil with an almost subdued pride.  

At the moment of his death, Khamurn visited him for a final time, offering
him immortality; for a price, as always.  What the price or barter between
the two was is not known, though widely rumored.  In the end, Malenrion
returned to the Canyon under the terms of a demonic pact, content to
continue handling and amassing wealth as chief merchant among the
Raiderkind.

#LORE This is the ring of the first Raider Lord, Aralor.  After systematically
eliminating the other contenders for his position amongst the original
Circle of Twelve, Aralor stood as the undisputed leader of the Canyon. 
Anticipating the onset of old age, Aralor knew that he could remain the
leader of the Canyon for as long as he could fend off the rising tide of
challengers.  

Unwilling to relinquish his hold on power, Aralor appealed to the dark gods
that had empowered the Raiders.  His prayers and sacrifices were soon
answered.  Not only was he granted the immortality he sought, but he was
further gifted with strength beyond that of mortal men, and a supernatural
relation with the shadows of the world.  Aralor rejoiced and marvelled at
his new powerse, believing that they ensured that he would never fade from
the face of Avendar.  

But power comes with a price.  For in attaining his powers, Aralor had
unwittingly ascended to the status of a demigod, and was now bound by the
divine law that binds all immortals.  No longer could he freely inflict
himself upon the world like a cancerous plague.  Instead, the sole object of
his desires now lay behind an invisible shield whose laws and workings lay
beyond his grasp.

pain mars the figure's features, eyes screwed up in agony and mouth twisted
in an obscene grimace.  

From the figure's hunched back three claws are sculpted in the act of
pushing their ways through the flesh and bone.  Curved and wickedly tipped,
they seem to possess some pent-up energy of their own, even though the
statue is cold and absolutely motionless.  

A definite sense of menace surrounds the statue, a nameless malice akin to a
caged, angry beast.

#NAME A Suspension Bridge
#DESCRIPTION Rays of light cut through the gaps between rocky archways up above and
the myriad of vines hanging from them, their harsh glare landing upon the
ever swaying body of the suspension bridge.  The base of the bridge is made
up rows of long wooden planks, unevenly slapped together, and suspended upon
a lightly woven frame of rope.  Roughly wide enough for two full-sized men
to cross side by side, the hastily slapped together bridge nevertheless
looks far from stable, and liable to break apart at any moment.  The
frazzled hemp hand-rails do little to help the illusion of the bridge's
stability.  A constant roar echoes from far below, coming from a rushing
stream flowing to the east, feeding into the fens and the Dantaron.

at the bonfire's base.  Racks of roasting meat turn by the edge of the

#NAME A Path Behind the Tents
#DESCRIPTION A thin path branches off from the main avenue of the canyon walk,
circling its way around the mass of tents.  Hemmed in by a sheer cliff wall
to the north and a flapping tent canvas to the south, the actual path is no
more than two spans wide.  Rivulets of water from the Dantaron trickle down
the walls, forming small puddles by the side of the trail.  Winding its way
against the sandstone cliffs, the path winds its way back westward.  To the
south, the trail descends into a steep incline, ending in a large, man-made
pit.

#NAME The Training Pen
#DESCRIPTION The incline to the north suddenly widens into a large earthen pit, ringed
with spiked body-shields.  Roughly ten spans deep, the training pen is a
circular arena, roughly dug from the earth.  A thick layer of dirt covers
the ground, sending up clouds of dust with each step.  High above, rocky
crags jut out from the cliff wall, casting a lengthening shadow across the
battle grounds.  The pen is suffused with the musky scent of blood and
sweat.

#KEYWORDS  shields
#DESCRIPTION About the edge of the pen, body-sized shields are placed end to end,
covering up the earthen walls.  Roughly five spans tall, each one bears a
single steel spike, jutting out of the center of the shield.

#NAME A Fortified Alcove
#DESCRIPTION This small alcove has been carved into the crumbly stone of the canyon
wall.  Vines grow lush and thick about the top of the entrance.  The floor
of packed dirt is strewn with gnawed bones and wood shavings, apparently the
site of many an idle hour.  A low, crude wall of stones has been stacked
partway through the alcove, hiding the back of the alcove from view to the
east.  The alcove narrows gradually towards the back, the stone showing the
many pickaxe scars.  To the east, you are provided with an excellent vantage
point overlooking the board-covered storage pit.

#NAME The Raiders' Dressing Room
#DESCRIPTION The rogue, known to many as 'hoody' or 'Feldyn', is in actuality, the first
Raider Lord, Aralor.  After systematically eliminating the other contenders
for his position amongst the original Circle of Twelve, Aralor stood as the
undisputed leader of the Canyon.  Anticipating the onset of old age, Aralor
knew that he could remain the leader of the Canyon for as long as he could
fend off the rising tide of challengers.  
  
Unwilling to relinquish his hold on power, Aralor appealed to the dark gods
that had empowered the Raiders.  His prayers and sacrifices were soon
answered.  Not only was he granted the immortality he sought, but he was
further gifted with strength beyond that of mortal men, and a supernatural
relation with the shadows of the world.  Aralor rejoiced and marvelled at
his new powerse, believing that they ensured that he would never fade from
the face of Avendar.  
  
But power comes with a price.  For in attaining his powers, Aralor had
unwittingly ascended to the status of a demigod, and was now bound by the
divine law that binds all immortals.  No longer could he freely inflict
himself upon the world like a cancerous plague.  Instead, the sole object of
his desires now lay behind an invisible shield whose laws and workings lay
beyond his grasp.  
  
Aralor pleaded with the dark gods for a renegotiation, but after the passing
of several years, he concluded that this was not to be.  Since then, Aralor
has bided his time, perfecting his skills, and scouring the land for ancient
lore regarding his divine bondage.  He maintains a passing interest in the
Raider Canyon, ensuring its permanence in the lands.  However, his long life
has given him perspective and understanding of the cyclical nature of the
balance between the Houses.  He hopes to gain an understanding of the laws
that bind him, and then, true to nature, subvert them, that he may once
again inflict himself upon the lands.
