#DESCRIPTION A tall nefortu stands before you, his brown leathery wings arcing upwards
toward the heavens.  His stance seems relaxed but prepared, ready to leap
into movement at any time.  His eyes, a ghoulish ebony color, blink rarely,
analyzing every movement that comes to pass before them.  His face exudes a
feeling of calmness, coupled harmoniously with a pair of eyes that bear the
sharp glint of stoic dedication.  Branded on his arm is the sigil of the
Black Staff, which pulses with pure darkness periodically.

#DESCRIPTION This large golem towers twelve feet into the air forming an imposing
humanoid figure.  It is constructed of gleaming steel, with thick plates
covering most of its body.  A chill black mist seeps from the joints where
the plates are not, settling in low, dark fog about the construct's feet.  A
mechanical clicking and whirring can be heard from within the golem and
grows louder when it moves.  The face of the golem is a featureless steel
mask save for a pair of dark pits where the eyes would be, sockets
reflecting nothing but absolute darkness.

#NAME The Entrance to the Shrine of Rveyelhi
#DESCRIPTION The entrance to the monolithic Shrine of Rveyelhi lies through an arch of
basalt stone to the north.  Breaking an otherwise blank outer curtain wall,
the arch allows access to a small courtyard.  Twin sculptures of a robed,
severe shuddeni, the god's avatar of choice, flank the smooth, undecorated
arch.  To the north, a black basalt stair climbs out of a tiny, open yard to
a forbidding edifice crafted from the same dark stone.  Imposing and
monolithic, the square building tapers slightly at the top, but is otherwise
unadorned.  To the south, a spur of Glallia Street wends its way back into
the city.

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  twin sculpture sculptures robed severe shuddeni statue statues
#DESCRIPTION These statues are carved from polished black marble, crafted with a
masterful hand.  Mostly unremarkable, each depiction of the ascetic shuddeni
holds a ceremonial staff in its left hand, the right clenched in a fist at
its side.  One feature is particularly salient on the statues, however: a
sardonic, bemused smirk, cruel in its very amusement, twists the thin stone
lips of the figures.

tall curtain wall of unpolished basalt.  On the fourth side, the monolithic
Shrine of Rveyelhi rises to the north.  An arch in the southern wall allows
access back to the city to the south.  A black basalt stair climbs out of
the small, open yard to the forbidding edifice which crouches above you. 
The square building tapers slightly at the top, but is otherwise unadorned. 
A small font of water surrounds the base of the plain stone obelisk which

#NAME The Hall of the Black Staff
#DESCRIPTION This open, square hall in the Shrine to Rveyelhi is easily fifteen feet
in height, made from smoothly-polished basalt.  Walls, floor, and ceiling
are all crafted from the same, seamlessly reflective stone, the overall
effect somewhat disorienting though pure and unbroken by anything which
might distract the gaze.  This intersection of halls is lined with
supporting columns, the ceiling ascending in an angular, stepped curve to a
central point high above the floor.  To the east and west the hall narrows
into smaller side rooms, and a hall leads south to the entrance. 
Northwards, a large chamber opens up to house the altar of Rveyelhi.  The
air is very chilly, laden with a thin, alchemical smell.  A definite tension
lingers in the air, a preternatural stillness more reminiscent of stone or
metal than of atmosphere.
