#NAME The Portal Chamber
#DESCRIPTION You are in a small chamber, surrounded by tall, intricately carved
pillars.  Set in the room are three glowing portals, each shimmering with
light as faint images pass behind them.  The first portal glows a soft gold,
and the pictures that shimmer past it seem fast and frequent.  The second
pulses with a dark blue aura, and seems to almost flicker from view.  The
third is a warm green, a blurred tree coming into view as the portal shifts
and changes.  A small tablet is carved into the smooth marble of the floor,
explaining where each portal travels to.  Aside from the portals, the only
exit from the room is east to the main part of the temple.
