that is constantly burning and to the west a small tent opens.  Off to the

tent, filling almost a third of the room inside.  Near the opening at the
eastern end of the tent, a haphazard collection of horns, bones, and teeth
has been assembled, lying in disorganized clumps on the hard-packed dirt
floor.  Several open crates lie on the other end of the opening, waiting to
be filled.

of the savannah is thick and lush, but remains passable.  Down below the

#NAME A Spacious Entrance Hall
#DESCRIPTION This tall, square room is built from square blocks of alternating light 
granite and a dark, banded gneiss, forming a checkered pattern.  Four 
ornamental pillars of striated grey marble stand in each of the corners, 
fitted with torch-bearing sconces.  A large set of sturdy wooden doors 
stands in the eastern wall, thick iron hinges and rows of studded 
florin-spikes making it quite formidable.  An open archway leads south to 
some type of hall, and small doors squat in the northern and 
western walls.  The ceiling above is a slightly vaulted continuation of the 
walls, the patterned blocks curving to a central point.  Directly 
below, a jet of water sprays into the air, falling back into a carved black 
marble basin.  A circular bench surrounds the fountain, made of the 
same polished marble.

Built from dark granite, the room's ceiling and walls are bare and 
unadorned but for two matching shelves, centered in the northern and southern 
walls.  These shelves, built beneath twin skylights, are lined with 
various exotic flowers in white pots.  A small door leads east into a tall 
room.  A plain desk of some light wood sits in the center of the room, 
a few small nibs and papers scattered across the surface.  A small 
stool sits behind the desk, and a single chair faces it, back to the door.  
A comfortable cot sits against the western wall, appearing to be seldom 
used.

#NAME A Meeting Hall
#DESCRIPTION This long meeting hall is dominated by an enormous wooden table crafted 
from a single, gigantic tree trunk.  Two disproportionately immense 
chairs stand at the head and foot of the table, the former lined with 
embroidered red satin, and the latter with a rich blue damask.  Several far 
smaller chairs, made of carved wood, line the sides.  The roof curves 
far above in a seamless, formed-stone dome.  Below the dome on the 
eastern wall a small stained-glass window depicts a white-draped woman, 
hands folded across her chest as if in prayer.  Torches are interspersed 
with small, bland paintings of scenery along the walls behind the chairs.  
An open archway leads north into a smaller room.

#NAME A Small Storeroom
#DESCRIPTION The walls of this tiny storeroom are made of polished, dark granite
slabs.  A small, heavy door to the south is fitted with a thick iron
deadbolt, a large keyhole noticeable within the metal.  A small picture
window sits in the northern wall, giving an expansive view to the savannah
outside.  A fairly large round wooden table sits in the center of the room,
the only piece of furniture.

#NAME Entrance to a Ruined Temple
#DESCRIPTION Once the entrance into a great stone temple, time has reduced this room
into a ruin.  Few of the large stone pillars which once held up the roof of
this enclosure remain standing, the rest toppled and crumbling through
neglect.  The roof is pitted with holes, and a large section has collapsed,
cutting off the entrance into the temple proper.  The savannah grasses,
whose thick growth around the temple prevents exit, have began to claim the
inside as well, filling the gaps between the cracked floorstones.  A rotting
pile of grass and fur lies in one corner of the room, and bones and
droppings litter the floor.
