the sacrifice of innocents in any way, shape, form, or fashion.  Those of
pure heart, free of hate, greed, lust, and the like, should and must be
protected from the night.  Nothing is more important to those of the light
than  their own soul.  At what price can we sell our own
innocence to the night?  Keep the faith, hold yourself at bay from evil, and
the light will call you home." 
  
 
 
Those who find integrity in the law will find their path south.
Those who would free light from all its shackles should head north.
For those who seek only the light, and nothing more, their egress lies east.

have realized that the in the eternal struggle between good and evil, there
is room for a path not taken by the zealots of either side.  Neutrality,
free from the war of good and evil, is free to be a many faceted beast. 
Some seek the grey path in nature, others in the sprawling cities, others
still find motivation for their quest in the soul of a single mortal. 
Always remember, though, that your path strives to keep good and evil in
equal measure, without letting either side prevail.  
 
Those who seek their path in the law should head east.
Those who find their way in the chaos of the maelstrom need go west,
While those who seek a path of pure balance will find their way north.

#DESCRIPTION Greetings, Seeker of Mysteries.  You alone have chosen the True Way, the
Way that the blind have chosen not to see.  Those who walk in darkness
realize that their own ends come before the petty needs of the whining
masses of humanity.  Realize your goals, and attain them.  No price is too
great for the satiation of your desires, and reachings the ends of your
will.  Those of pure heart will often try to stop you, and will number among
your foes.  Those who walk a grey path are easily twisted to your own ends -
promise them much, deliver what little is needed to win their trust, then
let their bodies and minds be your tool.  Your greatest threat, though, does
not lie among the fools who walk in the light, but rather, your fellow
darkfriends.  Trust them not, for they see Truth as you do, and will stop at
nothing to attain their own ends.  Be wary of the knife in the back, the
poisoned food, or the whispered spell of death.  Twist the weak among the
fellowship of the damned to serve you, and strive to master, rather than be
mastered.  Remember to trust no word higher than your own will, and spare no
sacrifice in the pursuit of what is yours.  
 
Seekers who have harnessed an ordered mind should head South.
Seekers who seek power from the fury of chaos need go North.
Those who find purity in evil alone depart west.

#DESCRIPTION The imp that frequents this room has the key you seek.
Before you fight him, though, you should "consider" him.
Try "consider imp". Consider gives you an idea of how tough
a creature is before you try your hand at slaying it.
So, as a general rule, consider first, and look before you leap.
To kill this imp, type "kill imp".
Don't worry, he's a softie as monster go, and you're more than his match.
Once you've killed him, you'll notice the following things:
 
-Another imp has taken his place - they seem to multiply quite fast!
-Unless you have some combination of "autoloot" and "autosac" on,
his corpse is still on the floor, and the key is inside it.
To get the key from his corpse, type "get key corpse".
 
The message is continued on the second plaque.

#DESCRIPTION In general, when a creature leaves behind a corpse, you can destroy it by
typing "destroy corpse".  If you want to do this automatically, and aren't
doing so already, type "autodestroy".  You can also sacrifice corpses to the
god of your choice.  Type "help sacrifice" for more details.

If you want to automatically get everything from a creature's corpse when
you kill it, use the "autoloot" command.  Be warned!  Some creatures carry
cursed items that you might find hard to get rid of, so it's a good idea to
not do this all the time unless you have a good reason.

You also probably want to loot all the gold from a creature's corpse
automatically. You can do this with the "autogold" command, and don't
worry -- there's no cursed gold.

If you want to manually take all of the loot and gold from a corpse, you can
use the "get all corpse" command.

Once you have the key, you can head back east to get out of this corridor.

be able to see anything at all.  So, make sure you're holding a light source
when you go in if you want to be able to see.  The torch you started with
works nicely, as does any glowing item.  If you did not get a torch when you
entered the school, go back south and get one.  Experiment with the dark
room a bit.  Remove the torch, look, then wear it again.  When it's dark,
you will only be able to see glowing things in your inventory.  So, it's a
good idea not to go exploring without a light source, as there are plenty of
places that are dark, and some places that turn dark at night.

Greetings, mortal. Your travels through the great beyond and the Siege 
Perilous have brought your spirit to the world of Avendar.  Who can know
what twist of fate has brought you here?  A forgotten spell, a wrinkle in 
space and time, the hand of a god -- regardless, your fate lies in the here
and now of this world.  When you leave this room, you will assume your
physical form.  Be wary, as for every great hero, the path is different, and
often rent with fire and blood.  Head through the portal to the north, and
you will find yourself at the entrance to the School of Heroes, where you
will take your first steps as a mortal.  Put aside all things of the world
from whence you came, and steel your heart for the journey into Avendar.
Look carefully, and learn much -- all you learn in the School will serve you
well. Depart now, and may the gods curse you with an interesting life.

depicting the history of Avendar.  On a backdrop of white marble, the murals
are divided into a series of panels which divide the history of the world
into various ages.  Bracketed torches are used to highlight key moments in
history, giving the whole wall an eerie pattern of lights and dark.  To the
north, the murals break off as the passage reaches a junction, while to the
south the hall is lined with a series of statues.

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#KEYWORDS  ninth
#DESCRIPTION The ninth panel depicts the time following the war with the shuddeni. 
Human cities are seen rebuilding, but new races spread and grow around and
in the midst of the humans.  Ethron villages spring up in forests, while
ch'taren wander the roads of Avendar.  Sly nefortu skulk in cities, emerging
from their own caves.  Human cities seem just as grand, but are portrayed as
fraying about the edges, with buildings gradually decaying here and there. 
Time progresses, until a new race appears, coming down out of the frozen
northlands.  Red-furred kankorans move as a horde, attacking the north wall
of a vast city.  The panel ends with the northern half of the city
devastated, but with the kankorans driven far away from its walls.  The
panels come to an end here, marking the beginning of recent history.

beings entirely unexpected by the shuddeni.  Golden skinned ch'tarens,
faintly translucent, rush through the portal, calling down light and bolts
of purity against the confused shuddeni.  Following this is a scene of above
ground, with a triumphant human and ch'taren army bringing the magics of
spirit against the shuddeni, driving them back underground.  The end of the
war is a period of healing, and new fortresses are shown in the mountains,
guarding the largest passages into the depths.

#KEYWORDS  seventh
#DESCRIPTION The seventh panel starts with a focus on a winter mountainscape.  Out of
a crevasse in a ground boil a mass of shuddeni and chaja, descending like
locusts onto the mountainside.  Leading an army of axe-wielding chaja,
shuddeni swordmasters, black-robed scholars and diabolical monstrosities,
dark shuddeni templars sweep down out of the highlands to bring battle to
human settlements.  Titanic battles fill the mural, showing the full scope
of the clash between the humans and the monstrous shuddeni war machine.  The
humans at first hold their own, but are gradually driven back, losing cities
to the might of the shuddeni.  The panel ends with a scene set far below
ground.  Shuddeni are in the midst of some dark ritual, and gathering in an
unholy configuration around a gigantic portal, of midnight black.

#DESCRIPTION The sixth panel picks up where the fifth left off, showing the aftermath
of the War of Flame.  Srryn are driven back into the swamps, and victorious
aelin and humans begin a period of dramatic reconstruction.  Human cities
spring up around a long river, one built around a prominent tower by an
ocean, another at a fork in the river.  Aelin cities seem to shrink into the
background, as the mural focuses on human growth and expansion.  Human farms
and culture spreads throughout the mainland of Avendar, from peak to vale. 
Scholars appear who create buildings out of the earth, calling into being
great towers and high walls.  Human armies march against various foes,
inevitably expanding their sphere of control.  The mural ends as human
explorers come upon a vast underground city -- filled with teeming masses of
shuddeni and chaja.

#DESCRIPTION The fifth panel begins with a portrait of the first meeting of 
the humans and srryn. Gathering in great armies, sparks of flame
dot their encampments, representing the spread of the magics of fire.
Advancing waves of human and srryn swarm into the mountains, doing
battle with elegant formations of aelin. Several such battle scenes
are depicted, with aelin gradually withdrawing to the walls of their
cities. The mural then changes its focus to a small group of humans,
who are seen battling groups of srryn, and traveling across vast
stretches of icy plains. After descending into the side of a mountain,
they emerge marked with sigils of sapphire spears. The next scene is
that of a great battle -- on one side, hordes of srryn and humans,
and on the other, aelin, human, and a group of gigantic beings,
calling down ice to quench the flames of the srryn.

#DESCRIPTION The fourth panel begins with a depiction of the desolation following the
Sundering and the fall of the alatharya.  Great forests spring up, and
overtake the ruins of the fallen giants.  And, gradually, life returns. 
Aelin appear in the mountains, hunting and building villages in the high
peaks.  Cities spring up, and parties of aelin are seen carrying ancient
artifacts into their mountain homes.  Eventually, a great floating city
peeks from behind a cloud, filled with aelin of every manner.  At the same
time, lizard-like srryn begin to emerge from the swamps far below, swelling
in numbers.  The panel ends with the appearance of a new race -- the humans,
who have simple settlements dotting an immense river.

#KEYWORDS  third
#DESCRIPTION The third panel begins with a scene which shows a catastrophe all over
Avendar's globe.  The great pyramids of the alatharya are shown in all
stages of destruction.  Some alatharya are set on fire by brimstone and
flame for the heavens, while others are devoured by unspeakable monsters
which slither out of crevices in the broken ground.  Overhead, three great
gods look over the destruction.  One is a dark and malevolent figure, clad
in black armor.  A stern-faced figure stares out over the destruction from
underneath an iron helm, while the third gazes sadly over the destruction,
clad in robes of deep blue.  The panel ends with a closeup of a single
alatharya, cradling a marble bust of one of his own kind in his arms. 
Staring at the stone visage, a look of profound loss is etched on his face,
as his blank eyes look for meaning in the last remnants of his people.

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#KEYWORDS  second
#DESCRIPTION The second panel picks up where the first left off, showing the alatharya
as they ascend to the acme of their power and influence in Avendar. 
Gargantuan pyramids dominate landscapes, and wonders abound.  Cities float
overhead, while sculptors craft marvelous statues, and scholars call forth
beings of pure magic to serve in the creation of cyclopean obelisks.  As the
alatharya grow more advanced, a gradual change descends over their demeanor.
At first noble and determined, a look of avarice steals across their
features as time progresses.  Alatharyan priests and scholars look to the
heavens with longing, and, in time, with greed.  This trend comes to a head
near the end of the panel, where an ominous scene shows circles of scholars
engaged in rituals at their great pyramids.  Silver light arcs from their
peak, descending from the heavens and bathing those involved in an eerie,
flickering glow.

Formless chaos is presided over by the greater powers, who shape and

giants -- the early alatharya.  They are shown building the first great
cities, and fighting a series of great battles against great dragons and
monstrous demons.  The last scene in the panel depicts the first alatharya
to use magic, shown as a lone giant raising his arms to the heavens, calling
down a shimmering energy against a large black dragon.

Every character has certain skills, spells, or songs. At any
time, if you want to see a list of all abilities in which you 
can potentially improve, use the PRACTICE command by
itself, with no arguments.
 
You begin your life with five practice sessions, and will gain
more sessions with each additional level. The number of 
sessions you gain is dependent upon your character's 
wisdom.
 
You can improve your abilities in one of two ways:
 
(1) Exchanging practice sessions for ability at a guildmaster.
(2) Using an ability on your own
 
It is very hard to use an ability in which you only have 1%, so
it is recommended you go to a guildmaster first.
 
At a guildmaster, use the PRACTICE command to learn the
skill. The syntax is:
 
PRACTICE <Skill>
 
The amount that you learn in a given practice session is 
dependent upon your intelligence. 
 
Be warned that not all guildmasters know all possible abilities,
nor will they all give their training freely.  So, sometimes you
will have to look far and wide for the more exotic skills or 
spells.

brute force.  Rather than being formally trained in combat they instead
acquire their lessons from the harsh realities of a life given over to rage
and war.  Understanding little of civilization, they eschew the path of
those who embrace the law and instead prefer to remain unbound by excessive
rules or protocol.  Allowing their rage to consume them, they become
formidable opponents.  
Barbarian skills include:

whatever tools he has at hand to acquire what he wishes.  Due to their

formal notion of law, and consequently often roam the roads of Avendar.

You begin your life with five practice sessions, and will gain

sessions you gain is dependent upon your character's 
wisdom.

You can improve your abilities in one of two ways:
 
(1) Exchanging practice sessions for ability at a guildmaster.
(2) Using an ability on your own

It is very hard to use an ability in which you only have 1%, so
it is recommended you go to a guildmaster first.

At a guildmaster, use the PRACTICE command to learn the
skill. The syntax is:

PRACTICE <Skill>

The amount that you learn in a given practice session is 
dependent upon your intelligence. 

Be warned that not all guildmasters know all possible abilities,
nor will they all give their training freely.  So, sometimes you
will have to look far and wide for the more exotic skills or 
spells.

At a guildmaster, use the PRACTICE command to learn the
skill. The syntax is:

PRACTICE <Skill>

The amount that you learn in a given practice session is 
dependent upon your intelligence. 

Be warned that not all guildmasters know all possible abilities,
nor will they all give their training freely.  So, sometimes you
will have to look far and wide for the more exotic skills or 
spells.

The aelin are a race of avian bipeds, gifted with the power of 
flight. One of Avendar's oldest sapient races, it is known the
aelin were the first race to come into its own following the
Sundering and the fall of the alatharya.
 
From the beginning, the aelin were a civilized people, seeking
order and creation to oppose the madness of the years
following the Sundering. Their civilization reflected both this
desire for order, along with the predilictions of their avian
nature. They built great cities, wrought out of the sides of the
great mountains they called home. Freed from thechaos of the
magical storms that marked the Sundering's aftermath, they 
were able to lead a propserous existence, finding pause for
contemplationand thought.
 
The aelin were also a rather insular people, shunning the
lowlands and vallies, whose primitive inhabitants they felt
would taint the purity of the aelin people. This policy would
prove in the end detrimental, however, when the aelin became
embroiled with what is now known as the War of Fire, the first
great conflict of Avendar following the Sundering.

The alatharya  are reputed to be the oldest of the sapient
races of Avendar, with a history stretching back to the
dawn of time. As legend has it, the alatharya were once 
the chosen people of the gods - gifted with both phenomenal
strength and formiddable intellects. Using these gifts, the 
alatharya spread across the surface of Avendar, creating a 
civilization of legendary proportions.
 
For how long the alatharya remained as the masters of
Avendar is unknown - but they remained long enough for
the ruins of their wondrous cities to still occasionally be 
found here and there - monuments easily thousands of years old.
 
Amidst this mythical setting, though, the alatharya were not 
destined to remain the lords of the earth. Using the magic that 
the gods had given them, the alatharya grew mighty in both 
knowledge of Avendar and their study of  the planes and 
structure of the universe. Unsatisfied, though, with the limits
the gods had placed on their power, the alatharya sought ...
more.

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  alathsec2
#DESCRIPTION -2-

Delving into the power that upheld the very firmament, the
alatharya began to tap the quintessence -- the source for both 
magic and the divine planes, on which the gods dwelled. But 
when the alatharya attempted to use their newfound powers 
against the gods, they discovered the depths of their folly.

Anticipating the hubris of their first creation, the gods turned the
schemes of the alatharya against themselves.  Great was the vengeance of the
gods the alatharya had scorned, and greater still was the punishment they
bore.  It is written that within the course of one year, not a single of the
their great cities or temples remained.  The great forces of magic were
split, in an event which historians now know as the Sundering.  No longer
bound as a single force, magic was free to run rampant across the surface of
Avendar in the form of torrential, earth-shattering storms.  Beings of
divine fury and unholy wrath were let slip from the heavens, ransacking and
destroying the creations of the alatharya.  

For the alatharya themselves, they bore the harshest punishment of all. 
Stripped of their intellect and wisdom, the alatharya found themselves
wandering the earth, no longer with the wit or ability to grasp the magic
which was the gift of the gods.

Virtually ignored by the aelin, other races had sprung up in 
Avendar's lowlands. Among them, the reptilian srryn and the
wingless humans allied together to take the riches of the aelin
culture. With these two opposed races, the aelin faced their
greatest threat - foes armed with the magics of fire. Easily
mastered and bringing instant returns, the humans rapidly
trained scholars and military leaders in the ways of the magic.
 
The aelin marshalled the resources of their people -- the
accumulated wisdom of their own civilization, coupled with
what artifacts and relics they had recovered from the ruins of
the ancient alatharya. The war that ensued was long and
devestating to the surface of Avendar, resulting in a conflict
second only to the Sundering in its catastrophic effects. 
 
It was not until a renegade group of humans, along with allies
among the aelin, brought about the return of the god Jolinn
and the magics of the seas, that the war turned in favor of the
aelin. With all these things, and the aid of the mighty Titans,
the aelin and what humans allied with them were able to drive
back the srryn to their swamps, ending the war in a series of
swift and final battles.

After the war, some predicted a period of aelin ascendancy. 
And, for a time it was so, as the aelin  cities were still the only
true centers for thought and civilization in Avendar. The
humans, though, with their prolific reproduction and more
open culture, began to dominate the political landscape of
Avendar.
 
The aelin were content to withdraw into their high cities, and
become a distant ally to the humans, shaping their ideas, but
seldom intervening in any large scale in human affairs. 
 
Exceptions exist, of course -- the chief one being the aelin's
interventionin driving back the shuddeni menace in the War of
Night. Today, while some aelin do consent to dwell away
from their homes in the mountains and the clouds, most live
far from the center of human civilization, across the Sea of
Lidraeu, content to dwell near their capitol, Ilodaiya.
 
Aelin are generally lean, with a height generally ranging
within the human norm. Their features and bodies  are both
delicate, and aelin will typically take great stock in what
bloodlines or houses they are affiliated with. Their most
striking feature, of course, are their wings, which are feathered
in the manner of avian kind. What aelins do dwell among
humans typically occupy positions of authority, or at least
influence and wealth.

The ethron are a people indigenous to the forests and the 
woodlands of  Avendar. First recorded by the historians of the
first century of the Republic, the ethron appeared as refugees,
whose forests and homelands in the south had been destroyed
in the War of Fire. 
 
The earliest contact between humans and ethron came when
the then king of Gogoth deeded the forest of Qilarn to a large
group of ethron, who in return cleared the place of srryn and
other undesirable forces. It is from this group that most of the
ethrons known to the histories descend. 
 
Living in the great forest, the ethron made their homes in and
above the trees, bringing life to the forests that surrounded and
protected them. The ethron also divided themself socially into
clans, with a chief (usually male) heading the people of a
given region.

The ethron also proved to be a gregarious and robust people,
friendly with those who were willing to trade or make peace
with them. Often allies of the humans of Earendam and the
surrounding regions, the ethron were often equally fierce
opponents of the srryn and shuddeni, opposing the latter in
the War of Night.
 
Physically, the ethron are short and stocky, averaging about
five feet in height. Most notable is their skin, which is a
striking shade of green, often matching the leaves and
undergrowth of the forests in which they make their homes. A
vital, strong people, the ethron are known for  their staunch

The nefortu make their homes in the caves and low places of 
Avendar, living away from the bright Avendarian days. The
first real contact  between nefortu and the surface began in the
War of Night, when they were employed by the shuddeni as
assassins and thieves.
 
With the victory of the light, the nefortu were quick to turn on
their shuddeni allies, gaining respectability in hunting and
driving the shuddeni out of the caverns nearest the surface.
Noting the opportunity for profit in dealing with the surface,
the nefortu established colonies and trade routes there, causing
their people to flourish.
 
The nefortu, already a fragmented people, often lack any
unified system of government or civilization. They are,
however, almost universally crafty, and skill in deception or
wit is often taken as a mark of respect among their people. 
Old religions, devoted to spirits of air and fire still persist among  their people, though most now ascribe to more
modern deity-worship.

The kankoran are a fierce and savage people, descended from 
the ancient wolves. Near the average human height, kankorans
appear as heavily furred wolf-men, complete with savage jaws
and lupine demeanor. Strong and  hearty, they are relentless
warriors, more skilled with the ways of weapons  than with
what dabbling they have in the magical arts.
 
Kankorans appeared in the annals of early aelin explorers, as
well as the records of the early Republic.  They do not figure
significantly, however - mainly as savages living in distant
and frozen lands in the far north.  It was not until the years
following the War of Night that the kankorans came with any
numbers into the lands of the south.
 
Driven by some unknown force, red-furred kankorans began a
long and  protracted' series of  raids along the borderlands of
the Republic. Gathering momentum along the way, the
kankorans formed into a rampaging horde, rapidly sweeping
through the already weakened provinces of Earendam, looting
and pillaging along the way.

This spree was not stopped until the kankorans reached the 
very gates of  Earendam itself. The Republic was victorious
over the kankorans, but the victory was a painful one -- with
no one to hold the reigns over surrounding  territory, the
political landscape of Avendar fractured, leaving power
vacuums here and there.
 
It was in the more northern reaches that a second wave of
migrant kankorans  arrived, brown, rather than red-furred.
Victims of the long winters which had driven the earlier
kankorans south, these wolf-men were more willing to share
hunting grounds with the war-ravaged humans. Trading the
fur and hides of their kills with hard-pressed human
settlements, they carved a niche for  themselves in the
mainstay of Avendarian life.
 
Kankoran society is chiefly structured around packs of
nomadic tribes, usually headed by the strongest and most
powerful male of the pack. Occasionally, in times of crisis, or
under the leadership of a truly powerful or charismatic male, 
one pack will rise to dominance over the surrounding packs,
forming them into a horde. A mainstay of kankoran life are
also their religion, which views their gods as manifestations of
ancient wolf spirits -- a practice bordering on ancestor
worship.

Kankorans are seldom bound by any sort of law or rule, save 
the very primitive behaviors that typify behavior in the pack.
In more recent times, the kankoran peoples have spread
through Avendar, and one may even find them occasionally
walking the streets of Earendam or Var Bandor, though those
who leave their pack are still the exception, and not the rule.

The srryn are a race of humanoid reptiles. Covered with a 
leathery skills and naturally gifted with whip-like tails, they
are cunning warriors and will  often use their natural abilities
to good advantage. 
 
Mainly dwelling in the swamps and lowlands of Avendar, the
srryn make their living by trading the rare roots that grow in
their homelands, along with itinerant raids on whatever
settlement lie close to their demesnes. The srryn have little of
the formal amenities of government or oganization, choosing
instead to live in smal villages in the swamps. Srryn
leadership is usually determined by age,  predicated on the
assumption that no incompetent lives long enough to come to
power.
 
Despite their primitive surroundings, the srryn are one of
Avendar's oldest races, with an origin shortly following the
Sundering. The earliest written record of the srryn concerns
itinerant raids by them on  various aelin settlements, and
measures taken to combat them.

For a long period of time, the aelin viewed the srryn as 
hopeless primitives, and viewed them more a nuisance than a
threat. Somewhere near the high  point of aelin dominance,
however, events began to unfold which would lead to the srryn
not only becoming a potential threat, but also potential 
rulers of all Avendar.
 
Matters are unclear on how or why the Srryn discovered the
magics of fire - perhaps the workings of a mad god, perhaps
the primitive rituals of the srryn shamans stumbled upon the
right mystical combination to unlock the power of
flame. However it came to be, this new magic turned the srryn
for a race of primitive and bickering warlords into a force to
be reckoned with.
Cowing the humans who lived around them with both force of
magic and the promise of more power  to come, the srryn
began a series of campaigns to unite their disparate forces. The
srryn and their human allies came against  the aelin with the
suddeness of an inferno. 

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

At first it seemed the aelin's might civilization would fall
quickly, as one  by one their cities were overrun and put to the
flame. Once the aelin  realized the nature of the threat,
however, they rallied their republic to face the srryn. Using the
relics and weapons recovered from the ruins of the ancient
alatharya, the aelin fought let loose with a swift series of 
counterstrikes, driving the srryn back to a stalemate.
 
The stalemate, though, was an untenable one. The srryn and
humans were both virile races, swelling in numbers to replace
those who fell in battle. Furthermore, their magic was strong
and new, and the aelin were slow to renew themselves, and
their success depend on the rapidly fading power of
ancient weapons and tools. 
 
In the end, the srryn lines did not break until entirely new
forces came into play. Humans not under the sway of the
srryn, with the aid of a daring  minority of the aelin, followed
the clues of an ancient prophecy, journeying to the
northlands to awaken the god Jolinn.

Bringing with them the aid of the magics of water, human, 
aelin, and the newly awakened Titans attacked the srryn 
warlords in the plains and  lowlands of Avendar. A series of
cataclysmic battles marked the end of the War of Fire, as the
desperate srryn and human forces tapped directly into the
elemental plane of fire, often drawing more power than they
were capable of safely channeling.
 
The srryn and their allies lost these great battles, decimating
their forces and laying barren many of their homelands.
Defeated and hunted, the srryn withdrew to the deepest
swamps, hiding themselves from the victorious forces
of aelin.
 
For most of the rise of the humans and during the period in
which the Republic of Earendam held sway over most of
Avendar, the srryn were a relatively isolated people. Content
with the occasional raid or to waylay what travellers who
came into their power. In the War of Night, the srryn allied
briefly with the shuddeni, but turned against them when they
realized the eyeless ones had no intenion of sharing power
with them.

small parcels of territory. No longer universally feared, the
srryn are still distrusted, and by no means ignored by the other

The caladaran are a peaceful people, given to contemplation of 
the ways and nature of Avendar.  Tall and thin, with a stoney,
bark-like skin, the bodies of caladarans resemble walking
sticks. Their faces are more humanoid,with most caladarans
showing little signs of age for most of their life.
 
Caladarans first appear in human records shortly before the
formal beginning of the Republic of  Earendam. First noted as
wanderers from the east, the caladarans brought with them
the magics of earth, though they rapidly took to the healing
arts which had so dominated following the War of Fire. The
caladarans also brought with them theworship of Iandir,
embodying the principles most of the caladarans  lived by.
Previously worshipped only as a disembodied force, the
worship of order and law became a religion among some
humans, giving rise to the first codified set of laws as well as
the written script used as the basis for the common tongue
today.
 
For as long as caladarans have been known, they have served
as teachers and healers, though seldom as warriors or men of
the sword. Preferring a solitary lifestyle, they will nevertheless
live in cities or towns if it suits their purposes (their healers in
particular).

The ch'taren are the most recent race to come to the attention 
of scholars, first appearing in the latter parts of the War of
Night. The original home of the ch'taren is unknown, and the
ch'taren themselves do not speak of it, other  than to describe
themselves as 'refugees'. What is known is that the ch'taren 
exploited what is perhaps the greatest Summoning in
Avendar's history in  order to enter this plane of existence. The
shuddeni, seeking to bring an end to the War of Night, had
attemped to create a long-term nexus to the Void.
Instead of an army of demons from the Void, however, the
shuddeni inadvertently conjured an army of the ch'taren, who
had adapted the  shuddeni's spell to bring them to the prime
material. The ch'taren brought with them the magics of spirit,
and the worship of the goddess Rystaia, and served as a
galvanizing force in the final defeat of the shuddeni.
 
The ch'taren appear as semi-translucent beings, roughly 
humanoid in form, with some combination of gold skin and
silver hair. Not quite of our plane, material objects will
sometimes pass through a ch'taren, making them difficult
to capture or slay with mundane weapons. Contrawise, some
tie to the ethereal plane makes them susceptible to magical
energies.

#DESCRIPTION The shuddeni are a subterranean race, living in underground 
cities far below the surface of Avendar. Shuddeni appear as
extremely thin humanoids with ashen gray skin, absolutely
lacking in all body hair. Most distinctive about  the shuddeni,
though, is the complete absence of eyes. In the place of the
orbs of the eye, shuddeni have nothing but a slight indentation
of smooth flesh. Rather than seeing in the conventional sense,
the shuddeni have some other way of detecting shape and
essences.
 
Most of shuddeni culture revolves around life in their cities,
which were originally formed by successful families, or Septs
as they are now known, of  shuddeni. In time, the holds of the
Septs acommodated allies of the family, until they eventually
became large enough to sustain themselves independent. 
 
Today, shuddeni cities are governed by a ruling caste of
priests, who maintain their power through the use of magic
and command of the lion's share of the city resources.
Shuddeni guard their cities with the aid of the chaja, a race of
massive slaves. Shuddeni cities will occassionally ally
themselves with one another, but bloody disputes have been
known to erupt over matters of territory or itinerant raiding.

#DESCRIPTION Human contact with the shuddeni occured in the years prior to
the War of  Night, when mining expeditions in the Brintors
revealed a passage to Yithoul, one of the largest of the
shuddeni cities. After several initial ventures there met
their end, the shuddeni established a gradual relationship with
the Republic.
 
What the senate did not know was that these initial peace
overtures were merely the first step in a massive shuddeni
campaign of conquest for the surface world. Extending their
power to certain groups not in favor under the policies of the
Republic (Srryn and humans willing to practice forbidden
magic among them),  the shuddeni began to ally themselves
with these factions. 
When the shuddeni burst to the surface, they brought with them their most potent weapon -- the magic which drew on the 
negative energies of the void, binding demons and horrific
plagues. The shuddeni had with them their savage chaja
slaves, who formed the bulk of their fighting forces, along
with their  trained swordmasters, all wielding the dark blades 
of their kind.

#DESCRIPTION On the surface, srryn turned against the Republic, along with
small pockets  of human rebellion, particularly among
scholars. The shuddeni boiled to the surface, rapidly
consolidating a foothold in the Brintors and the northlands
Once secure, the shuddeni conquest became a less rapid, if
seemingly just  as certain.
 
The humans and their allies began to fight in desperation,
attempting at least  a holding action against the shuddeni. The
Republic's fortunes seemed to be taking a turn for the worse,
with each step forward followed by two steps backward. The
shuddeni, though, were not content for a lengthy and
protracted war. They were eager to take possession of a land
not denuded by the consequences of war. They wanted a  swift
victory -- and took steps to ensure it.
Drawing together the greatest archmages of the void, the
shuddeni sought to create an immense nexus to the void. The
gateway was to open for three days, to bring through and bind
the largest and most powerful of demons, for use in one final
assault on Earendam. The result of their Summoning,
however, was not what they intended. Instead of an army of
demons, they brought through a great host of ch'taren,
refugees from an outer plane.

In time, some shuddeni came to find permanent homes on the
surface, still mistrusted but accepted as a necessary evil in
troubled times. Below the surface, some shuddeni still scheme,
plotting a return of conquest,  viewing themselves as
predestined rulers of Avendar.

The ch'taren, desperate to escape perceived threat, broke
through the lines of the shuddeni, and fought their way to the
surfaces with the aid of human slaves. Using the magics of
spirit and their numbers, the ch'taren brought the
War of Night to the swift end that the shuddeni had hoped for
-- with a victory for the Republic and the forces of the light. 
 
The shuddeni were defeated, but still a threat. Some shuddeni
remained in  strongholds in the Brintors, proving too
entrenched to easily removed without considerable loss of life.
The main shuddeni tunnels to the surface were  walled off,
preventing the easy passage of large bodies of shuddeni.
 
In the centuries following the War, the shuddeni took
advantages of the weakening of the human Republic to
cultivate a more favorable attitude toward them on the surface.
Still feared, some shuddeni became known for their scholarly
works, providing magical transportation across Avendar.
Others cultivatedtheir reputation as exotic bards, convincing
noblemen of the artistic merits of the bizarre shuddeni musical
scales.

Humans are one of Avendar's most adaptable races, with at
least some humans living in most all of  the land's various
locales. Humans trace their origin to a time following the fall
of the alatharya, with their first civilizations appearing near
the Dantaron river valley. 
 
The aelin provide the first written records of humanity, 
portraying them as savages  'on the border of beginning a
civilized existence'. The aelin generally left the humans to
themselves, though a few tribes seem to have traded with
smaller aelin cities. 
 
Humanity's progress towards a more settled mode of existence
was interrupted, however, by events in the lowlands of
Avendar. The srryn appeared with the magics of fire,
transforming them from a race of itinerant raiders to potential
warlords. The humans were faced with a choice that was
none too difficult to the primitive mind -- ally with the srryn
and their magics, or be driven into forced servitude.

The humans proved apt pupils for the magics of fire, and with
their aid, the srryn brought upon the aelin the conflict that was
known as the War of Fire. The war at first went extremely
well for the srryn and their human allies, with aelin cities
toppling before the new and destructive magic of fire. 
 
Given time, however, the aelin organized a staunch resisting,
rallying their collection of ancient artifacts to aid them in
battle. At the same time, the new human warlords gained a
keener insight into the motivations of the srryn, and 
were less eager to sacrifice their own people when they
became aware of the srryn's rapacity. So, while the war still
was in the favor of the humans and the srryn, the 
pace and manner of their victories had slowed, giving the aelin
more time.
 
It was this time which was the aelin's salvation. A rogue band
of the humans, dissatisfied with a life of bloody conquest,
departed from the main body of the human forces, daring to
seek protection from the aelin. For their part, the aelin
were willing to accept the rogue humans, who offered aid to
the aelin in defending their cities.

The humans were to prove more useful to the aelin that just
more defenders for their city walls, however. The scholars
among the aelin had access to the  prophecies given in the last
days of the alatharya, along with the most potent
of magical artifacts. Forseeing destruction if any other course
were followed,  the aelin sent the humans among them on a
journey to the frozen northlands.
This journey, now legendary, was made by the humans to find 
and awaken the ancient god Jolinn, Lord of the Seas. The
journey is recorded in detail in other texts [See Tyalin's work,
The Quest of Aramril, or the epic poem of the same
name by the poet Quarentis], but suffice it to say the humans
were successful in their task, and as a consequence brought the
magics of water to Avendar. Along with these new magics, the
humans also succeeding in enlisting the aid of the Titans, who
agreed to return with the humans to fight the srryn.
 
With their newfound allies, the aelin fought a series of
cataclysmic battles, driving the srryn back to their swamps.
The leaders of the humans who had allied with the srryn were
all slain in battle, or executed by the victorious forces.

The aelin cooperated with their human allies in creating a new
human government, with the heroes of the quest situated in
key positions of power. And, truth be told, most of the humans
who had fought with the srryn had  done so under duress, and
even those who had been eager for battle were now in a
position to appreciate the consequences of war. Avendar's
surface had been ravaged by the last battles of the war, laying
waste to fertile lands and inundanting barren deserts.
 
The period following the war, however, was one of sustained
prosperity. The humans established trade with the aelin, who
were eager to have access to the fertile natural resources of the
lowlands. In return, the humans had a fondness for the mineral
wealth of the mountains which were the home of the aelin.
 
Culturally, the humans were greatly influenced by the aelin's
unique style of government (the Republic), as well as the
development of the magics of earth, a gift of the caladarans, a
people who came to the Dantaron valley from the lands to the
east. These factors all lead to the development the first
of the great human cities,  Earendam.

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#DESCRIPTION -5-
 
From Earendam grew what today we now know as the
Republic of Earendam. The Republic became a mainstay of
Avendar's political landscape, offering  protection and peace
to numerous human kingdoms, which inevitably became 
incorporated as provinces. With the increasing human
expansion, the aelin seemed more inclined to isolate
themselves. To many, this marked the end of 
the golden age of aelin civilization and the beginning of
human dominance.
 
During the heyday of the Republic, the extent of territory was
vast, stretching from the icy wastes of the north to the
southern jungles, and from the X ocean  in the west to the
mountains of the Rim in the east. What the leaders of the
Republic had no way of realizing, however, was that policy of
unbridled expansion would emperil the very existence of their
way of life.
 
Mining ever more deeply into the Brintors, humans eventually
came upon  the subterranean world of the shuddeni. Eyeless
and unspeakably evil, the shuddeni at first sought to establish
diplomatic ties with the  Republic, attempting to insinuate
themselves into surface life.  The decadence of life in the
Republic proved easily susceptible to the temptations of the
shuddeni, who brought with them the magics of the void.

And, when the shuddeni felt they had sufficiently infiltrated 
human society, they brought their armies to the surface,
passing unseen to a hidden place in the Brintors, where they
began their conquest. Backed by legions of their brute chaja
slaves, the shuddeni also had the aid of various demon lords, 
summoned to wreak havoc among their foes.
 
The first winter of the War of Night marked the beginning of
the shuddeni offensive. Striking quickly, and under cover of
night, they struck at the human cities and settlements in the
Brintors. They brought with them the magics of void, striking
terror in the hearts of their opponents, who were often 
sacrificed to the shuddeni's gods. Taking advantage of the
closing of the passes into and out of the Brintors during winter, the shuddeni fortified their new holdings, taking
advantage of the delay afforded them by the weather to
move the bulk of their armies to the surface.
 
Elsewhere in Avendar, the Republic had to cope with internal
dissent from humans with a vested interest in its fall. The
srryn, eager to take advantage of the new threat, rallied for
battle, harrying human forces as they assembled to deal with the shuddeni menace.

With spring came an escalation of conflict, as the forces of
Earendam met the shuddeni army in a series of  bloody battles.
Unused to fighting the magics of the void and demonkind, the
humans lost the first battles of the war, often forced to flee far
behind their own lines. This continued for the first 
two years of the war, with humans making only marginal
gains against the invaders
 
Given time, though, the humans adapted to some of the
shuddeni's battle tactics. After the second year of war, the
humans began to hold their own in the battles, if gaining very
little net territory. With the coming of aelin warriors from
across the sea, the humans seemed prepared to hold their own
for some time to come.
 
Eager not to become in a protracted war, the shuddeni turned
once more to their dark magics. Calling together the
archmages, the shuddeni attempted a great Summoning.
Whether the result was a magical accident or predestined 
is a matter of debate, but what is known is that the human's
fortunes turned that day. The ch'taren came through the great
shuddeni nexus, bringing the magics of spirit, and doom to the
shuddeni forces.

Battles still remained to be fought, but with the aid of the
ch'taren and their magic, the humans were able to
systematically drive the shuddeni back beneath the surface of
Avendar.
 
After the war, however, the Republic did not possess the same
stength and unity it once had. Various provinces had been
forced to fend for themselves during the war, giving rise to a
patchwork of independent states, each with a charasmatic ruler
who had lead it through the war.Var Bandor, the city nearest
Earendam, severed its ties, recognizing Earendam as a trade
rival without the military forces to make firm its control. In
Gogoth, a king ruled, refusing to turn control of his country's 
rich farmlands over to the tax assessers of Earendam. And, in
the Brintors, the shuddeni still had footholds here in there in
the high places of the mountains.
 
Despite these problems, the Republic continued as the
reigning human institution for the next two and a half
centuries. It was the kankorans who rang the death knell for
the Republic, invading from the icy wastes in the north of
Avendar. Militarily and financially ill-equipped to defend
against what amounted to a full scale invasion, the senate was
forced to withdraw the armies of the Republic to the inlying
provinces. The kankoran horde fought its way to Earendam
itself until it met its final end.

#DESCRIPTION -9-
 
After this period of barbarian invasion, the Republic
underwent one final  collapse. Coming under the leadership of
a Patrician, Earendam became an independent city state,
finally severing its ties with eastern provinces it could
no longer protect and trade monopolies in the Crimson Sands
it could no  longer maintain. 
For a time, human society completely fragmented, with each
city jealously guarding its holdings against roving bandits. In
recent years, however, humanity, while politically divided, has
gained a certain strength in its ability to cope and deal with
Avendar's other races. Less isolated than the aelin, violent 
than the kankorans, or dangerous as the shuddeni, the humans
have succeeded both as diplomats and as rulers in many
portions of Avendar, leaving them still as the dominant race.

#DESCRIPTION The Guardians of Law are a noble House now under the protection and 
guidance of the god Iandir. The origin of the Guardians may be found 
many centuries ago, when the nobles of the Ipsoli line began offering 
monetary rewards for the apprehension of the land's most notorious 
bandits. This system evolved into a system of laws instituted by the 
Ipsoli, and a corresponding reward put on the head of any who dared to 
violate these laws. Eventually the heroes of Order were received by 
Iandir, who declared that their system was under his divine protection.
Today, the Guardians of Law are universally recognized by local 
governments as impeccable enforcers of peace and order, and welcomed in 
every city. Any who violate the laws set forth by the Guardians are 
marked for a reward, which is granted to any citizen apprehending the 
criminal. See help reward, help law, and help Iandir for more 
information.
All who wish to join the Guardians of Law should address a note to
Guardian explaining in detail their background, philosophies, and reasons
for desiring to serve. Applicants should then seek the current leaders and 
attempt to prove their worth.

#DESCRIPTION The Champions of Avendar are known throughout the realms as
defenders of the light and as evil's chief enemies. Reknowned
for their bravery and devotion to the protection of the innocent,
their order has stood as a bulwark against the forces of darkness
since the War of Fire.
 
The champions pay devotion to three principles:
 
JUSTICE:
 
The only proper punishment for evil is the destruction of their
plans and capacity to harm the innocent. Contrawise, those of
pure heart must be protected at all costs.
 
COURAGE:
 
Champions must show courage in facing evil. Whether facing the hordes
of evil as a lone hero, or as a general directing the armies of the
light, a Champion never allows his fear to overcome his devotion
to the salvation of all Avendar.
 
MERCY:
 
Champions must show mercy to those who truely repent of their deeds,
for it is better that one be lead from darkness by thought and deed
than to destroy the body without saving the innocent. Succor
should always be rendered to the innocent, for theirs is the essence
of why a champion fights.
 
Above all, a Champion should and must strive to become the embodiment
of the ideals he or she represents. The Champion strives to be
an example for all of Avendar, and an unstoppable force in the war
against evil.

#DESCRIPTION You are now near your guildmaster, who can help you
practice your abilities.
 
Every character has certain skills, spells, or songs. At any
time, if you want to see a list of all abilities in which you 
can potentially improve, use the PRACTICE command by
itself, with no arguments.
 
You begin your life with five practice sessions, and will gain
more sessions with each additional level. The number of 
sessions you gain is dependent upon your character's 
wisdom.
 
You can improve your abilities in one of two ways:
 
(1) Exchanging practice sessions for ability at a guildmaster.
(2) Using an ability on your own
 
It is very hard to use an ability in which you only have 1%, so
it is recommended you go to a guildmaster first.
 
At a guildmaster, use the PRACTICE command to learn the
skill. The syntax is:
 
PRACTICE <Skill>
 
The amount that you learn in a given practice session is 
dependent upon your intelligence. 
 
 
Be warned that not all guildmasters know all possible abilities,
nor will they all give their training freely.  So, sometimes you
will have to look far and wide for the more exotic skills or 
spells.
