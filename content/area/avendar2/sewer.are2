#DESCRIPTION "Snake Oil" Mofi, brother of Aribban the peddler, is short for a human at
about five feet two inches.  Well beyond his prime, he is as portly as he is
short, but has the appearance of one who hasn't lose strength despite
present conditioning and age.  A two-day stubble darkens his chin and
cheeks.  His curly black hair is streaked with grey and is slicked back in a
thick tangled mass which reeks of animal lard.

pointed look of a rat.  Overlarge ears sprout from his head on either side,
and his face is pockmarked from some earlier affliction.  Dressed in little
better than rags, the man seems hungry and underfed.  Thin cheeks and a
prominent chin complete this unattatractive face.

him.  His skin is encrusted with filth and dirt; clearly he has not washed

wild, darting eyes.  Shifting erratically from place to place, never

milky white eyes which strain to fulfil their function as sight organs, and
his wrinkled cheeks are free of facial hair.  A tall brow features two
astonishingly bushy eyebrows of a dusty green, and an unruly shock of hair
of the same color perches atop his head.  Strong hands are showing definite
signs of aging, the bones more prominent, and a few small freckle-like spots
speckled across the backs.  A vacant smile lurks about the frail caladaran's
lips.

as is her greasy pink lip color.  Her clothes are emphatically designed to
be as revealing as possible while still nominally serving their purpose,
dirty and spotted with beer and grease.  Her form, once curvaceous, now
seems dumpy, and her once-golden wings are bedraggled and unkempt.

ambitious researches, is notorious for his determined and brutal methods of
ascertaining facts about the arcane and mysterious.  Bitter and angered, he
has retired here, to brood on his situation and continue in the small ways
he can.

of white, curly hair which reaches nearly to his waist.  The crown of the
caladaran's head is shaved clean but for a small lock of hair, bound into a
topknot.  Long, wiry limbs and slender fingers add to the caladaran's
already decidedly scholary air.  A simple, faded robe of neutral grey-brown
adorns the priest's shoulders, and a glowing hourglass sigil marks him as a
devotee of the god Chadraln.

#LORE This heavy parchment is the type sold only in the cheaper stores,
well-laced with a cheaper filler material.  Clearly kept in and using
materials gathered from a sewer, the crown is spotted with bits of mold that
speak of constant humidity.  The greenish silt-rich mud, soaked into the
spongy paper, has been taken from the bottom of a submerged channel.  The
orangeish mud bears crumbs and tiny chips of old brick, of the type used in
Earendam's construction, and the yellowish clay comes from a vein of soil
rich with ochre.  The soot comes from pine torches, carefully daubed onto
the paper with a small finger.

#DESCRIPTION This low lump of stone seems natural, though it has been crudely shaped
into a block-like form to serve as an altar.  The highly porous pumice is
charred soot-black, and flames burn with no apparent fuel about its base. 
Though the flames radiate definite heat, they provide no illumination
whatsoever.  A black candle sits atop the altar, an inches-tall tongue of
hellish red flame providing the only ambient light in the room.

#DESCRIPTION This round tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, walled with crumbling,
dull-orange brick so eroded and crumbled with age that it seems a miracle
the tunnel is still clear.  Coated with a layer of transparent slime, the
tunnel descends into knee-deep water of a sickly greenish-grey color to the
south, and continues up a slight gradient to the west.  The air here is
humid, dank, and still, and seems quite flat and stale.  Thick with the reek
of sewage, the tunnel is dark and close.  One particularly intact brick in
the northern wall has been drawn upon with greasy charcoal.

the word "Vaialos" to the gem, though the lettering at the end becomes
almost too shaky to read, as if the author had been seized by a fit of

#DESCRIPTION This narrow, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage. 
Stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe humidity.  Dully-glazed brown
brick presses in on all sides, the sweating masonry sticky with the grime of
decade upon decade.  A rough floor of irregular stone makes footing
uncertain in the near-darkness.  Cobwebs dangle and float, ghostlike and
pale, moved by the barest hint of an undetectable draft.  A low wooden door
stands in the southern wall, swollen and slimy with damp.  The passage
terminates to the north, a rickety wooden ladder leading down into a square
of blackness.  The smell from the level below is colder and more earthy, an
older smell than the warm reek of rotting sewage from the south, though by
no means free of the distinctive source of excrement.

blocked by a pair of metal doors, painted a drab grey, which slide from the

#DESCRIPTION This large brass lever consists of an H-shaped shaft which protrudes the

the length of the piece.  Many small notches run along this slit at regular
intervals, apparently demarcations for the red enameled arrow which seems
designed to slide back and forth along the slot.  

The apparatus is apparently broken - the doors and wall have several
scrawled symbols marked on them in a faintly luminescent orange paint, and
the lever is loose and offers no resistance.

been converted into someone's home.  A small, rickety, wooden table stands
at the center of the room with a variety of items upon it.  All around the
rooms various niches have been carved from the stone walls and seemingly
useless junk are present within each niche.  A few strings of mushrooms are
strung around the room, drying and a pile of refuse lies in the corner.  A
small peat fire burns a distance away from the table, adding its stench and
smoke to the air.  Finally you also see a small pallet, constructed almost
entirely from what looks like discarded rags and mildewed clothing, tucked
into another corner.  To the west the sickly green wall still emits a
disturbing sound that fills the chamber.

miasma of the sewers still persists here, it is obvious that these tunnels
have not been used for many years.  A rusty steel ladder leads down into the
pit as the space opens up to the south into a cavelike pool of sludge and
body parts.  The smell is horrendous, rotting flesh and excrement reeking in
the humid, chill air.

by several large slabs of stone which seem to have wedged against one
another, blank and immobile.  Its walls are ragged, chalky limestone, with
sharp edges angling downward along each wall.  Below, a pool of cloudy,
foul-smelling covers the muddy floor.  Several scratch marks are evident in
the soft stone walls, each long set of gouges grouped in fours.  The air
here is uneasily still and stale, heavy with the reek of rot and damp. 
Below, a small gap in the southern wall leads from the chamber.

#DESCRIPTION This small nook is recessed into the wall of the pit.  The ceiling of the

adequate enough for several people to fit tightly in together.  The pungent
smell from the pit to the south still is present in the air here.  The floor
of the room here is rough dirt, as if there was no effort or time put into
completing this part.  The slimy mud walls of the nook bear the graffiti of
sprayed blood smears, as well as what appear to be some rough, scrawled
writing.  The low dirt ceiling opens up slightly to the south, where the
oddly-shadowed opening of the nook winds around an odd curve in the pit
wall.

configuration of the sprays are such that someone or something must have
been slashed to ribbons with unbelieveable force, or that rather heavy
arterial bleeding was left untended.

#NAME The Altar of the Aklaju
#DESCRIPTION A massive altar of black stone sits squarely in the center of this
chamber. Once a sewer chamber, this place has been converted into a place
of diabolic mystical focus.  The walls are clearly made from the bricks of
the old sewer, but they have been meticulously cleaned and inscribed with a
multitude of sinister runes.  Underfoot, solid blocks of granite have been
set over the muddy floor, then warded with some magic to repel water from
welling up.  Curiously, the all-pervasive strench of the sewers is very
faint here, replaced by an acrid, alchemical odor.  Illuminating the room
are braziers of smoldering coals, placed strategically to keep the altar
shadowed. There are exits in all four directions from this place, but of note
is the sturdy iron portcullis which blocks travel to the east.

#NAME A Charnal Room
#DESCRIPTION Judging from the ancient pipes and drains, this room was once a part of a
sewer.  This place's current function is not entirely dissimilar, as it is
devoted to the disposal of the dead.  Little care has been given to the
dignity of the dead, for numerous bodies have been mangled and strewn about
the room.  In the center of the chamber is a ring of black stones, each
inscribed with a rune.  Within the interior of the circle is a pool of pure
darkness, which crackles with some sinister mystical energy.  The room is
oddly free of the reek of both the sewer and the charnal house it has
become.  A likely explanation are two braziers, burning coals and some sort
of incense to produce both light and an acerbic, alchemical odor.  The only
exit is through an archway to the east.

by layer in some horrific mockery of a butterfly.  The eyes have been
removed, and the tongue hangs out of a slit in the bottom of the slack jaw
like an obscene trap door.  

The majority of the gore and blood in the room seems centered on the pool of
darkness, as though many leaking and bleeding pieces had been dragged or
carried to it.

wall, while a rack for holding wands and staves stands to the south.  A
sturdy metal trunk is bolted on the floor, sealed with a sturdy lock but

#DESCRIPTION Once a tunnel in the sewer, this place has been restored and converted
into a habitable chamber.  The walls are scrubbed clean, and any place where
water might drain here has been plugged or mortared over.  Covering the
muddy floor are ornate tiles, each carved with a different runic image. 
Dominating the room, though, is a square archway made of ornate black stone.
The archway is freestanding, and clearly designed for some arcane purpose,
for a flickering black portal shimmers within.  The only mundane exit from
the room lies to the north.

#NAME A Small, Ascending Pipe
#DESCRIPTION This medium-sized sewer pipe is roughly four and a half feet in diameter,
forcing even the smaller adventurers to stoop.  The metal of the conduit is
corroded and worn from untold decades of service, in places flaking off in
small, rusty chips.  Sounds of running fluids and the occasional distant
scurrying echo hollowly through the metal conduit, fading into the distance.
Many smaller pipes and channels feed into this one at regular intervals,
streaked stains of grime beneath the openings.  The humid air is cool,
though thick with the reek of raw sewage.  The pipe flows down a gradient
from north to south, and is intersected here by a larger conduit.  The
larger pipe terminates in a large, heavy grate to the east, and travels
westward through utter darkness.  A thin skim of slimy waste covers the
floor of the pipe, but any fresh filth flows quickly down the pipe to the
south.

city.  Ancient and flaking away in rusty shingles, the metal is almost
spongy in places.  Six feet in diameter, the conduit is coated in a layer of
mud and muck.  Thin trickles of putrid water issue from the smaller pipes
which empty into the tunnel, forming fetid pools amidst the waste.  The foul
stench of raw sewage and decay clogs the air, and the faint sounds of
dripping water echo against the tunnel walls.  The tunnel turns here,
continuing through the gloom to the east and south.  The air seems thinner
here, almost insubstantial.  A faint, sweet odor lingers, foreign and harsh
on the lungs.

the slowly-moving, glutinous scum which fills the runnel and pollutes the
humid air.  A round, brick-lined shaft leads upwards out of the passage here,
an iron ladder providing access to a blank metal grate.  The ladder, shiny

The filth is several feet deep here, a muddy, thick sludge of the waste of
hundreds of citizens mixed with old food, animal droppings, and other
unmentionables.  Whether this was a planned refuse pit or merely a severely
clogged access shaft is unclear; either way, the stench is incredible.  The

#NAME A Sewer Pipe
#DESCRIPTION This large sewer pipe is six feet in diameter, the metal corroded and
worn from untold years of service.  A disgusting slick of sludgy waste oozes
fitfully along the bottom, slimy and thick.  Sounds of dripping, running
fluids and the occasional distant clanging or scurrying echo hollowly
through the metal conduit, fading into the distance.  Many smaller pipes
feed into this one at regular intervals, streaked stains of grime beneath
the openings.  The humid air is cool, though thick with the reek of raw
sewage.  A long, narrow crack splits the roof of the pipe here, opening
barely an inch onto bare, blank rock.  The pipe curves to the south and west
here, ascending slightly to the south.

#DESCRIPTION The cold, wet sewer tunnel turns slightly upwards here, and dead-ends in
a small alcove.  The stone here is decidedly less filthy than other
sections, and the walls and floor show concerted efforts of some manner of
cleaning.  The ceiling above is formed to be of laid granite blocks - this
alcove seems to crouch directly under the foundation of one of the
buildings.  Old, torn blankets are gathered in lumpy piles on the floor,
each appearing to have been used recently as a bed.  A small set of shelves
lean drunkenly in one corner.  The air is somehow warmer here, perhaps due
to the gurgling pipe which snakes across the ceiling and disappears up into
the foundation.  The walls are kept almost entirely free of damp, care taken
to securely plug any chinks or holes in the stone.  A pair of smoking
torches have been affixed to the walls here, filling the area with
tempermental yellow light.

streets is quite narrow.  A thick layer of mud and muck covers the floor,
forming small pools before meandering through the accumulated waste towards
the circular chute which lies in the center of the room.  A rusty iron
ladder extends downward through the chute, leading down into the darkness
below.  Thin trickles of putrid water issue from the smaller pipes which
empty into the tunnel, forming fetid pools amidst the mud.  The foul stench
of raw sewage and decay clogs the air, and the faint sounds of dripping
water echo against the tunnel walls.  The tunnel comes to an end here,
though it continues to the east, from whence a steady stream of water seems
to flow.

lined with dirty straw lies against one wall, a man-shaped depression
nestled into the straw from long use.  A battered iron stove, cobbled
together with scraps of pipe and beaten tin, stands in a corner.  Unwashed
rags of clothing and other detritus of residence lies scattered about the
ground.  The scent of rot and raw sewage lingers heavily in the room, mixed
with the smell of wet animals and the subtle, coppery tang of blood.  A

thick, glutinous waste in the bottom of the channel emits a horrific stench,
moving slowly down the east-to-west gradient.  The massive pipe ends here,
opening into a small, cubical room to the east.  From this room flows the
slow current of sludge, added to by the many smaller pipes feeding into the
channel.

the tunnel is still clear.  Coated with a layer of transparent slime, the
tunnel climbs slightly to the west, where it narrows into an equally
corroded metal conduit.  The conduit curves sharply upwards, with several
inset handholds allowing passage up through the pipe.  Eastwards, it
descends down a gentle slope eastward before vanishing into blackness.  The
air here is humid, dank, and still, and seems to grow rather flat and stale
as the tunnel descends.  Thick with the reek of sewage, the tunnel is dark
and close.  Sounds of dripping water echo dully through the decrepit
tunnels, and the footing underneath seems shifty and uncertain in the thick
muck.

grime or filth.  Though the floor is covered with over a foot of glutinous,
slimy waste and the air reeks with the stagnating excrement, the rest of the
vaulted tunnel has somehow remained free of befoulment.  The wide tunnel
stretches away to the east, the walls conspicuously blank of any other pipes

small, corbelled ledge in the northern wall supports a crude earthenware
dish filled with liquid tallow, in which floats a twist of smokily-burning
cloth.  Westward, the passage fades in the half-light, but seems to come to
an end several paces down.  Southwards, the hall passes between a pair of
doors and continues on its way.  The air is dry and chill, smelling of dust
and cold earth.  The ceiling is a dirty, whitewashed mortar of some sort,
and the floor made from cheap, slightly uneven flagstones.

wool covers most of the floor here, looking forlorn and depressingly thin. 
Three small wooden chairs sit huddled around the brazier, and a long shelf
on southern wall holds a few cracked jars and limp flour sacks.  Crumbs
litter the floor, and several bits of old bones of various food animals lie
about, tossed carelessly away.  A small alcove to the west is curtained off.

a larger room filled with inconstant yellow light.

opening into a dim room.  The space below seems partially lit by a greasy
yellow, inconstant light.  The air seems to be layered here; the air from
above is wet and humid, laden with the reek of filth, whereas that from
below is much drier, smelling of cold earth.

of drain in the bottom of the wall.  A heavy iron hatch leads westward,
accessed by a short iron ladder.  The metal sides of this drain are coated
with a thick, gelatinous scum of an evil-looking green.  Tapering sharply
downwards to the east, the funnel ends at its eastern extremity in a hinged
grate which opens out into the roof of some large stone tunnel.  The sides
are utterly smooth and slick, and any earthbound being would be hard pressed
not to slide instantly down the slick tube.  A constant flow of thick,
gloppy sewage gurgles in from the west, skimming down into the stone tunnel
eastward.

lime and grit.  Round sections of the vaulted ceiling curve slightly upwards
periodically, the masonry slightly cracked with age.  Squat, square columns
lined along the northern and southern walls help support the older
architecture.  Small wooden tables are tucked off to the sides of the room,

drifting haze of tobacco and pine smoke.  Rough sconces in the wall hold
guttering, smoky torches which fill the air with a hazy, greasy yellow
light.  The floor is covered in a layer of slimy, slippery rushes, smelling
strongly of rot and urine.  The hall stretches away to the west and south. 
A heavy canvas curtain hangs across the opening of a small private alcove to
the north.

against the western wall.  Several squat lamps, hooded with pink, beaded
shades, illumine the room.  A hairy carpet of reddish wool, heavily stained
and besmirched, covers the floor.  The room stinks of body odor and perfume,
a small, smoking brazier adding the pungent reek of inexpensive incense to
the air.  A low, oval table of heavy maple sits in the center of the room,
the surface stained and scarred.  A heavy canvas curtain allows access

and wet earth, combined with the odor of unwashed bodies.  Long sheets of
pink cloth covering the entrance.  The low-grade chiffon is sheer enough to
allow the hallway's light to pass through, illuminating the niche dimly.  An
oaken chiffonier lined with bottles of oddly-colored liquids within hangs on
one wall.  A short-backed sofa rests in a corner of the alcove, sickeningly
gaudy cherry-hue fitting the over-all style of the chambers.  Wooden planks
line the ground, half-covered by rugs and assorted furs, seemingly an
attempt to conceal the over-all begrimed appearance of the room.  More
lengths of heavy red canvas line the walls, masking the raw stone and dirt
behind.  You may exit the alcove through the curtain to the west.

#DESCRIPTION This room is decorated with garish tastelessness, every hem in the room
drowning in frilly, foppish lace.  From the wall hangings to the cushions to
even the ragged, sad carpet, nothing has been spared.  A plain set of pine
shelves lean drunkenly against the back wall, bare and empty.  The air is
reeking with perfume and the smells of stale bodies.  A small lantern,
hooded and draped in pink lace, illumines the room with dim, flickering
light.  The ceiling is dirty plaster, cracked and stained with damp and age.
A filthy mattress lies in the center of the floor, covered in faded red
sheets.  A curtain of lace-trimmed canvas hangs in the opening to the south,
providing a modicum of privacy for this small alcove.

#NAME A Garish Alcove
#DESCRIPTION This small nook, dug into the raw earth off of the stone shaft to the
north, has been lined with warped planks and hung with large amounts of
cheaply-woven cloth.  Once dyed a vivid fuschia, water, damp, and time have
faded the cloth to a dilute, sickly pink.  A mound of lumpy cushions is
piled in one corner, a depression showing it to be regularly used.  A solid
wooden table sits to one side.  The air is filled with the reek of sweat and
perfume, and tinged with the hint of oily smoke and sewage.  A gauzy curtain
provides the barest amount of privacy between this alcove and the stairwell
to the north.

The creaky stairs spiral above and below you around the edges of the

completely covered with coarse flax hangings stained various shades of the
same rich pink.  A hairy pink carpet of dirty wool covers the floor, and

against the southern wall, the legs and base furred with mold.  Two
guttering candles light the room, floating in heart-shaped dishes filled
with greasy water.  The air is laden with cheap perfume, cloyingly strong.

#NAME Before a Small Altar
#DESCRIPTION This room is merely a tiny, curved alcove recessed into the side wall of
a long, low hall.  The air is thick with smoke, the smell of stale bodies,
and alcohol fumes.  Curved walls of cracked, aging mortar are stained and
streaked in places, and the floor is covered with a layer of slimy, slippery
rushes which smell of rot and urine.  A heavy canvas curtain, dyed a cheap
red, separates the alcove from the rest of the hall.  

The space is dominated by a heavy wooden altar, curved to match the sweep of
the wall.  The dense wood is stained a ruddy brown, and rough scenes of
battle, pursuit, and contest are carved into the sides.  A small dais before
the altar has been swept clean.  An emblem of a large, glowing wheel has
been carved and painted on the wood in gold.  A small, round hole in the
altar allows dedicants to make their donations.

#NAME A Crumbled Slope Under the Earth
#DESCRIPTION This tunnel bottoms out after a drop of slightly under twenty feet here,
running to the east.  The walls are predominantly muddy earth combined with
large rocks.  The tunnel grows more and more rocky as it runs into darkness
to the east.  The air is still and heavy, with the faintest hint of
brimstone lingering about.  A long ladder made from smooth, round poles is
bound together with lengths of decaying twine, allowing access up the steep
dirt slope to the west.

from rapidly-cooling lava.  The rippled stone is charred with a thick layer
of soot, dry and dusty.  Several small ledges of rougher rock protrude from
the cooled stone, seeming to have perservered when the flow covered the rest
of the wall.  The air is hot and dusty, laden with fine particles of soot.

faint crack at the base of the east wall emits a modicum of reddish light
and periodic blasts of parchingly hot gas.  The only other ambient light in
the room is provided by a black, waxen candle; a tongue of hellish red flame
burns, never wavering or flickering.  The candle sits on a lumpish black
altar of pumice which squats in the back of the crevice.  The fissure
continues to the north.

#NAME A Sharp Turn in Dark, Cold Stone Passage
#DESCRIPTION This narrow stone passage is chillingly cold and dark, the rough stone
walls coarse and unworn by the centuries.  The smell of dust is chokingly
heavy in the air, the air almost stagnant but for the faintest of drafts. 
The tunnel runs to the south and curves sharply around a chest-scrapingly
tight corner to the west.  Dust lies thickly on the stone floor.  The
natural stillness and silence of the empty darkness is almost oppressive,
seeming a tangible thing.

#NAME A Shadowy Meditation Chamber
#DESCRIPTION Stones stained dark with moisture arch over the entrance, opening into a
circular room.  Melting candles litter the perimeter of the near seamless
wall, flickering across the curved beams of polished redwood, revealing no
other apparent exit.  A paper lantern dangles from the shadowy ceiling, its
gloomy light filtering through thin blue paper into the smoky haze.  A
crudely rounded stone slab sits beneath.  A clay pot riddled with holes
squats between the candles.  Oval mats, thatched with reed, surround the low
table.  Opposite the entrance stands a folding screen of oiled parchment,
silhouettes playing across its semi-translucent panes.  The chamber is
large, but the darkness somehow crowds into the open space, making it feel
much smaller.  

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  paper blue thin lantern
#DESCRIPTION This paper lantern is formed from a smallish globe of bamboo struts, bent
into a sphere and covered with thin sheets of tissue.  A constant, dim glow
of enchanted light glimmers within, filtering through the bluish paper and
casting a decidedly gloomy light throughout the chamber.

#KEYWORDS  clay pot riddled hole holes
#DESCRIPTION Snaky streams of smoke pour out from the small holes that riddle the
sides of the clay pot.  The incense is pleasantly mild, its scent rich with

on top.

#NAME A Muck-Filled Tunnel
#DESCRIPTION This narrow, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage. 
Stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe humidity.  Dully-glazed brown
brick presses in on all sides, the sweating masonry sticky with the grime of
decade upon decade.  A shallow runnel travels south to west along the length
of the tunnel, following it into darkness in either direction.  This section
of the tunnel seems to be seldom traveled, judging by the largely
undisturbed nature of the filth to either side of the channel.  Smaller,
grooved channels emerge from the walls to join with the larger at regular
intervals, feeding waste into the slowly-moving, glutinous scum which fills
the runnel.  At the bend in the tunnel, large clumps of semisolid
putrescence have accumulated, augmenting the already overwhelming stench.

#NAME A Cramped Basement
#DESCRIPTION This cramped, dark basement is awash with conflicting smells.  The heavy
reek of raw sewage drifts from the darkness northward and combines with the
the pungent scents of exotic swamp fauna coming from the trap door above. 
The dim light from the trap door illuminates a short, simple ladder embedded
into the worn brown brick of the walls.  A few crates are stacked in a
corner.  The floor is hard-packed dirt, becoming slick with a film of damp
mud towards the northern end of the room.  Low wooden beams, solid and
sturdy, form the floor of the building above.  A small side passage leads to
the north.

#NAME An Intersection of Foul Tunnels
#DESCRIPTION This round tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, filled with about two
feet of thick, sludgy water, a semi-opaque unpleasant greenish-grey.  The
crumbling, dull-orange brick walls of the tunnel are eroded and falling
apart with age, coated with a layer of transparent slime.  The tunnel sinks
almost completely under the water to the south, and continues through the
knee-deep water to the the east and north.  In these two directions it seems
to deepen as well, though not quite as drastically.  The air here is humid,
dank, and still, so stale as to be almost spent of its life-sustaining
properties.  Thick with the reek of sewage, the tunnel is dark and close, a
small pocket deep under the bowels of the city.
