#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
This region is nestled between the crook of the Yagash mountains to the west, and a small plateau
which rises imemdiately southward. Gazing upward, you can make out some sort of structure atop
the plateau, but no trail provides a way to ascend to the top leve of the plateau. The soil is more rocky here, and less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob, which skirt the base of the plateau to the east.

ashen cast of the plains becomes more oppressive, as the geography of the
edge fades into the featureless gray monotony of Shargob proper.

The barren plains of Shargob stretch off in all directions here, open
space all about.  The soil here is an ashy gray clay, supporting little life
save a few pale, clinging fungi, which grow on the small rocks that lie here
and there.  The plains remain almost precisely the same to the east, west,
and south, but northward you can make out the faint green lines of the
forest of Qilarn.

The plains of Shargob begin to fade here, ashen gray soil gradually

#NAME Before a Ruined Gate
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
This area is near the edge of a mid-sized plateau, which overlooks the
plains of Shargob to the east.  By far the most prevalent feature, though,
is the beginnings of what appear to be a ruined city to the west.  Most of
an exceptionally tall wall remains intact to the west, over which you can
see the occasional crumbling structure jutting into the sky.  A large gate
once led west, but a huge pile of rubble blocks the way west.  Northward,
part of the wall has collapsed, also impeding further travel with the huge
remains of stone blocks which stand in the way.  A small path follows the
walls of the city to the south, and a thin trail leads off the edge of the
plateau to the east, leading down to what appears to be a road of some kind.

A plateau rises up gradually to the west of here, topped in a flat shelf.
Gazing upward, you can make out some sort of structure atop the plateau, but
no trail provides a way to ascend to the top level.  The soil is more rocky
here, and less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob, which lie
eastward.  The plains follow the edge of the plateau to a corner in the
south, while to the north there is evidence of a road of some sort.

A plateau rises up gradually to the south of here, topped in a flat

is more rocky here, and less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob,
which lie south and east.  Off to the west the plains come to an end as the
Yagash mountains jut up sharply out of the plains.

#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
This area is near the edge of a mid-sized plateau, which overlooks the
plains of Shargob to the east.  By far the most prevalent feature, though,
is the beginnings of what appear to be a ruined city to the northwest.  Most
of an exceptionally tall wall remains intact to the northwest, over which
you can see the occasional crumbling structure jutting into the sky.  To the
north and west small trails skirt the area between the walls of the city and
the edge of the plateau.

You fly above a crevasse here, a dark rift in the otherwise placid

of the crevasse to the south, while the ground resumes to the east and west.
Northward lies the beginning of crevasse, a shallow fissure cut into the clay
ground of Shargob.

Little light trickles into this crevasse, whose jagged walls prevent most

crevasse upwards, while the floor slants slowly downward to the south. 
Wafting through the chamber is a sort of cloying stench, which seems to grow

#NAME Deeper in the Crevasse
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
Deep into the crevasse, this area seems almost scooped out of the hard
clay walls, rather than naturally worn with time.  The floor is sandy with
ground bits of clay, and here and there bits and pieces of organic debris
litter the floor -- a bone here, shrivelled skin there, even bits of chitin.
A nauseating stench pervades the room, seeping into every crack and crevice,
filling everything with the foulness.  An exit from the chamber lies up some
handholds in the wall, or through a small crack to the south.  

Toward the center of the room, the disjointed cracks seem to take terrible
form.  

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION Violent, disjointed strokes seem to make some arcane figure within the
stone.  There are six jagged lines which form the main body of the symbol,
but numerous smaller geometric features jut off from the inscription like
angry breaks in the ground.  

The lines of the figure pulse with their own dark power.  Perhaps you could
learn more were you to study them.

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#KEYWORDS symbolvision
#EXTRA_DESCRIPTION As you study the cracks, the cave walls about you seem to fade and you
find yourself upon an ashen grey plain.  

Extending endlessly with no landmarks in sight, the waste spreads in all
directions.  The earth lacks even the clinging fungi of the Shargob.  A low
humming fills the air, source indeterminate, and a duststorm seems to rage
in the horizon.  As you take in surroundings a horrible realization occurs
to you, although you know not where from- You are upon the plains of Xixzyr
bordering the barren Waste of Oame.  

You feel panic grip your heart as you search for escape in a futile effort. 
As you do so, you realize the humming has grown louder, becoming a maddening
buzz.  Looking again to the horizon you see the dust storm fast approaching,
but realize it is not sand that makes it, but countless demonic, stinging
insects.  

With a scream borne of purest terror, your turn and flee the swarm, the
buzzing growing loud in your ears.  The insects are quick in their pursuit,
however, and the swarm descends upon you with cruel abandon.  

Pain erupts in a thousand spots as stingers lance your flesh and you feel
your blood boil as foul, alien toxins run through your body.  You swat
blindly at the abominations, your vision lost, your vain effort seeming only
to encourage their torture.  You feel your strength ebb, and you crumple to
the ground in pain too exquisite to comprehend, seeking escape in death.  

You suddenly are back within the crevasse in Shargob, the Cracks of Xixzyr
etched in your mind.

#NAME A Stony Chamber
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
The air in this chamber is very chill, and more stagnant than would seem
possible for even this crevasse.  Scooped out of the same gray clay as the
rest of the plains of Shargob, its walls are nevertheless encrusted with a
sort of black, rocky growth.  Arranged in a circle on the floor are more of
these rocks, which seem arranged by some crude hand to set them in their
place in the sand.  The only exit lies through a small crack in the wall to
the north.

#DESCRIPTION
This thin trail ascends into the stony reaches of the Yagashes.  The
torturous path twists and turns through jagged spires of sharp rock, and
passes over treacherous gravel underfoot.  The trail continues its ascent to
the west, and heads downward to the plains of Shargob to the east.

#NAME End of a Trail in the Yagashes
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
This thin trail comes to an end here, terminating in an abrupt drop to
the west.  Set amidst the sharp spires of the Yagashes, the trail is
relatively clear here, with the exception of a vertical slash in the wall of
the mountains to the north.  Lying on the ground, split in two, are the
pieces of a block of ancient silver, evidently designed to block entrance to
the northern cave.  The trail descends to the east, passing into rougher
terrain.

#NAME A Cavernous Chamber
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
This cavernous chamber shows signs of long use.  A variety of hide rugs
lie on the floor, haphazardly strewn amidst piles of old rags.  A huge
stalactite descends from the center of the ceiling, tapering to a narrow
point.  Water drips, ever so slowly, from the jagged tip of the stalactite,
falling into a small stone basin.  They only exit from the chamber is to the
south, where a jagged opening allows light to filter into the chamber.

#NAME At the Bottom of a Rise
#BEGIN_DESCRIPTION
#DESCRIPTION
This region is nestled between the crook of the Yagash mountains to the
west, and a small plateau which rises immediately northward.  Gazing upward,
you can make out some sort of structure atop the plateau, but no trail
provides a way to ascend to the top level.  The soil is more rocky here, and
less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob, which skirt the base of
the plateau to the east.
