#SHORT Lilisa
#LONG Lilisa, the Archmage of the Nexus, stands silently by the brazier.

#BEGIN_DESCRIBABLE
#BEGIN_DESC
Archmage of the Nexus and Priestess of the Secret Flame, Lilisa stands 
tall and regal by the golden brazier. Hair the colour of fire-bathed flame 
falls in long curls about her shoulders, spilling over a gown of midnight 
blue. Her face is pale and youthful, though the eyes which gaze, 
expressionless, over the long hall seem to hold the tale of long years 
beyond the count of her seeming youth. In one hand Lilisa holds a small 
ceremonial dagger, and the other rests by her side, fingers splayed as if 
ready for a casting of magic.

#BEGIN_DESCRIBABLE
#BEGIN_DESC
Clad in ornate black armour and standing some seven feet tall, Sydonus
the Damned holds his eternal station at the rear of the dais.  Once an
mortal assassin of great renown, Sydonus's unwitting sacrifice in the
formation of the Coven has left him more demon than man.  Great bat-like
wings stretch from his back, and razor-sharp iron claws protrude from his
thickly-veined hands.  His rugged features have a somewhat savage cast -
though his firm, square chin and high cheekbones speak of a certain
nobility.  His dark eyes now gleam with a dull redness, and single scar cuts
across the left.

#LONG A monstrous black spider with a near-human face clings to the webs above.

#BEGIN_DESCRIBABLE
#BEGIN_DESC
A bulbous black spider, the size of a cow, clings to the shadowy webs
which fill the high dome of this chamber.  The demon's abdomen is hairless
and mishapen, its shiny black skin scattered with livid blotches.  Its hairy
black legs are long and arched, and the four front legs end in sharp,
blade-like claws.  Beneath each of these claws project small, finger-like
protrudences.  The creature has not the face of a spider, but that of a
human, albeit a deformed, evil one.  The face is a fiery red, and twisted as
in perpetual rage.  Mandibles projecting from the rear of its jaw twitch
erratically.  Clusters of glistening purple eyes sit atop its forehead,
above its squinting human eyes, which, oddly, are bespectacled.

#BEGIN_DESCRIBABLE
#BEGIN_DESC
This young ethron woman diligently attends to the bath chamber, plying
her strong, nimble fingers in concert with a variety of oils and salves to
ease the weariness of even the tiredest warlock.  The girl has a stature
typical of her people - standing some five feet tall, comely and softly
muscled.  She is clad in white silks, which rest loosely about her waist and
upper torso.  Elsewhere her skin shows, smooth and pale forest-green.  Her
hair is also green, but of a darker, richer shade, and falls in waves to the
nape of her slender neck.  A cheerful smile graces her pretty oval face,
although her large emerald eyes seem distant.

A hugely built man stands near the center of this chamber barking drill
orders at the men and women who train around him.  Occasionally he will call
a trainee forward and instruct them personally, usually with a few punishing
blows of his tall, iron staff.  Clad from neck to toe in heavy, black plate
armour, only the man's head is left exposed.  With a noble, beak-like,
albeit multiply-broken nose, dark, intelligent eyes and tussled, sandy hair,
the man is quite handsome in a particularly bear-like fashion.

An old alatharya leans over his forge, his back bent by his endless
labour.  The smith's torso is a bulging mass of knotted muscle, covered only
by the scars which criss-cross his stooped back.  The scars look old, as
though this slave had learned long ago the harsh, final lesson of his
master's lash.  Framed by snowy hair and a long beard, the smith's face is
heavy with lines of toil and of age.  Faded blue eyes peer from beneath
bushy white brows.

A gaunt shuddeni clad in silken robes moves about the chamber, tinkering
with apparatus and sorting through materials.  The flowing robes do little
to hide the skeletal thinness of the creature's limbs, and his mottled grey
head is but a skin-sheathed skull atop a long, thin neck.  The skin which
covers the alchemist's eyesockets is yellow-stained, as are his nimble,
clawing hands.

A figure stands near the shadowy corner, cowled and robed in lightless,
black cloth.  No part of the creature is visible beyond the heavy folds of
its robes - its hands remain folded in front, hidden by voluminous sleeves,
and its face is invisible in the shadows of the low-pulled cowl.  Flickering
firelight occasionally catches the faint runes embroidered around the base
and sleeves of the robes, their harsh lines briefly shimmering red before
fading again.

Standing in perfect, motionless attention, this sentry could easily be
nothing more than a statue, with every stone inch covered in black plate
armour.  Even the sentry's eyes are hidden, the narrow slit between
face-plate and helm holding only shadows.  In the guard's right hand is a
tall, iron glaive.  The base of its black metal pole rests on the ground,
and its wickedly curved, knife-like blade is a full foot above the sentry's
head.

A huge specimen of the ancient khil'ayum has been bound with a circle of

tall, is covered in dark, glistening, horribly spiked chitin plates.  Its
long limbs end in great, sabre-like claws, each a few feet in length.  These
claws click in continuous agitation against the tiled floor, and the
creature's huge, toothy jaw opens and closes with slow regularity, spilling
a thin, viscous stream of fluid onto the ground.

This great leech-like creature stands erect in the southern alcove, a
vast pillar of slick, black flesh reaching the domed ceiling above.  The
tail of the demon is formed of a ring of thick, stubby tendrils, which splay
outward, planting it firmly to the tiles of the circle of power which binds
it.  A similar set of tendrils surround the leech's red maw, which twists to
face downward, revealing an inward-turning ring of razor-sharp teeth.  The
whole of the demon's sinuous body sways back and forth, and twists upon
itself, with a sickening rhythmic cadence.

#BEGIN_DESCRIBABLE
#BEGIN_DESC
Once physician to the Patrician of Earendam and Archmage of the Tower of
Salyra, Nyceanus Laodon dwells now in this deep chamber, gaunt and somber. 
Enslavement does not rest well on the scholar, with his glazed eyes and
sallow cheeks, and thin black hair clinging slick to his forehead.  However
he goes about his work with efficient precision, dextrous hands wielding his
scalpel with skill.  Curing as he harms, Nyceanus has become a master of the
arts of pain, and can reputedly bear open the deepest secrets of any
creature alive, so long as it is capable of feeling agony.

appear to be old and healed, covered with thin layers of pale skin.  Yet
each laceration forms a deep cavity in the caladaran's flesh, as though the
wound had been held open as it tried to heal.  Deep blue eyes stare blankly
at the ceiling from a ravaged face.

massive, muscular jaws hang open, revealing ichor-coated gums which bristle
with serrated fangs.  Greenish fluid drips from its mouth and its long,
lolling tongue.  The eyes of the beast are beady and black, and peer out
vacantly in opposite directions from either side of its oversized head.  Its
dead stare is reminiscent of the mindless, hungry gaze of a shark. 
Squatting dog-like on muscular hind legs, the idcizon shifts its ruddy,
hairless body restlessly, its protruding ribcage heaving as it pants in the
stale, cold air.

A figure stands near the shadowy corner, cowled and robed in lightless,
black cloth.  No part of the creature is visible beyond the heavy folds of
its robes - its hands remain folded in front, hidden by voluminous sleeves,
and its face is invisible in the shadows of the low-pulled cowl.  Flickering
firelight occasionally catches the faint runes embroidered around the base
and sleeves of the robes, their harsh lines briefly shimmering red before

#BEGIN_DESC
The lithesome form of an ageless saurian is here, his features a
serpentine, skeletal mask.  A myriad of tear-shaped, nacreous scales overlap
the corded muscles of his frame in a tight-fitting hauberk, each reflecting
milk-white hues, like moonlight glistening across murky waters.  A pair of
bony protrusions rest atop his scalp, horn-like, while a smaller ridges
disappear into the folds of his cloak, along his spine.  His arms are
adorned with twisting, fell tattoos, tapering to hideously scarred hands,
each tipped with curving claws.  A reptilian snout flares to wide nostrils,
set above a broad maw lined with small, pointed teeth, yet his countenance
is dominated by deep-set eyes -- almond-shaped pools of molten bronze,
unblinking and intense.  Around his neck, a hemp cord adorned with fetishes
serves as a makeshift clasp for the heavy, hooded cloak that hangs over his
shoulders, the fabric appearing to absorb light with every movement or
gesture.

#BEGIN_DESC
Archmage of the Nexus and Priestess of the Secret Flame, Lilisa stands 
tall and regal by the golden brazier. Hair the colour of fire-bathed flame 
falls in long curls about her shoulders, spilling over a gown of midnight 
blue. Her face is pale and youthful, though the eyes which gaze, 
expressionless, over the long hall seem to hold the tale of long years 
beyond the count of her seeming youth. In one hand Lilisa holds a small 
ceremonial dagger, and the other rests by her side, fingers splayed as if 
ready for a casting of magic.

#ED_KEY cloak pale billowing strips skin strip obj_12352
#BEGIN_ED_DESC
This long cloak is made from exactingly-flayed strips and pieces of skin,
somehow preserved and kept alive.  The material is warm and soft to the
touch, obscenely pleasurable to feel.  The cloak's patchworked component
pieces have been sewn together with threads of metal, the differing hues and
textures artfully laid out in subtle, interleaving designs.  Transparent
patches of golden ch'taren skin are bound beside verdant green ethron flesh,
soft pink and tough silver all bound in an unholy harmony of colors and
malevolent patterning.  A clasp of braided ch'taren sinew, beaten to silken
softness, affixes to two elaborate brooches at either shoulder.

#BEGIN_ED_DESC
This brooch, wrought from purest silver, is rimmed in a ring of braided
silver wire, the fine metal threads almost too numerous to count.  The
center of the elaborate brooch hinges about a stylized Eye of Bahhaoth,
certain key elements left out intentionally.  Worked to draw the eye of the
onlooker into the pupil of the Eye, no detail has been left untended.  Tiny
figures of filigree crawl inside the rim, minute humanoids bent in
subservience to the central pupil.  Captivating and fascinating, the brooch
clearly is imbued with powerful energies.  
#END_ED_DESC
#ED_KEY right
#BEGIN_ED_DESC
This brooch is forged from plain iron, smooth and dark, and inset with
dozens of delicate petals of razor-sharp, paper-thin onyx.  Each
seemingly-fragile petal is streaked along the inside of its concave face
with a welling stripe of velvety red hue, sanguine and rich.  The petals
cluster about a central nexus, bent inwards towards the middle.  Each bears
a tiny lesser rune of the Void on the back, picked out in glittering enamel.
As the floweret spreads wider, the petals slowly tilt, baring their
red-tinged faces to the onlooker.  A sense of protectiveness is conveyed
through the positioning of each small piece of stone, as though something
greater and more secretive were concealed at the center of the close-bunched
petals.  

The iron base of the brooch is preternaturally chill to the touch.

A table of rich, red mahogony extends much of the length of the hall. 
Its surface is polished to a reflective sheen, and its edges decorated with
intricate mouldings.  The legs of the table are carved in the form of great
lion's legs.  Around the table are a dozen finely crafted mahogany chairs. 
Each is plushly upholstered in red fabric, and their leonine legs match the
table's.  The table itself is arrayed with a sumptuous feast.

A low dais of reflective black stone extends from the center of the
western wall of this great hall.  Looming above, arches of stone rise to
support a massive dome of translucent tiles, through which shines a strange,
thin light.  Carvings in pale stone adorn the arches, architraves and dome
with images both splendid and grotesque, and on the western wall a
bas-relief of alabaster and jade depicts a scene of carnal and esoteric
magnificence.  In the center of the dais stands a great brazier, cast of
gold and set upon an obsidian pedestal.  A wispy darkness swirls like fire
within this bowl, in whose depths the blackness is absolute.

Shadowy planes of power seem to converge from the surrounding blackness
to this point, where they intersect, twisting upon themselves and giving
rise to mounting waves of greater blackness which ripple back into the
waiting void beyond.  Here, amidst the angled sheets and twisting streams of
negative flow, a region of dim light exists - little more than an unhappy
luminescence arising from the intermingling of energies - but enough to
grant the mortal eye vision of the Nexus-Vault of the Coven of the Shunned.

The northwestern corner of this vast hall is dominated by a great bronze
brazier, which burns with a fierce, red blaze.  The waves of red light shine
outward, reflecting off the nearest of the two rows of high pillars which
march eastward down the hall, and bringing into sharp relief the huge arches
which support the high, many-vaulted ceiling.  Ornate carvings glint from
the cornices and architraves, indistinct in the heady light.  A row of
smaller braziers line the northern wall, extending to another large brazier
in the far northeastern corner.  The ancient, quartz-streaked stone of the
pillars and walls is offset by the richly coloured banners and hangings
which adorn the higher reaches of the walls and drape between the pillars. 
To the south rises a dais, built of black stone and set with a great golden
brazier, which seems to burn not with fire but with wisps of darkness.

pillars march down the length of this great hall, supporting the series of

Row upon row of high bookshelves fill this lofty chamber, each rising a
dozen feet in the air.  From the top of each shelf a column of dark web
continues upward, opening outward to merge with the great mass of spider web
which fills the entire shadowy dome of the chamber.  Tendrils and veils of
web hang down from the mass, and certain parts of the library are completely
inaccessible due to thick layers draped between shelves.  

The books themselves seem to be uncatalogued, and only tenuously arranged 
into subject matter.  A number of glass-faced cabinets are stuffed with 
scrolls, and there are even several shelves holding stone tablets, etched 
with scripts long forgotten by all but the most recondite scholars.  Ancient 
desks of dusty, dark wood stand in the corners.  A single archway leads from 
this chamber to the south.

The eastern passageway opens into this high antechamber before leading
westward into a much larger hall.  The antechamber constists of a square
area capped by a domed ceiling, and two large, semicircular alcoves in the
north and south walls.  The floor of the chamber is an intricate mosaic of
tiny tiles, which swirl and weave in complex, symmetric patterns.  Toward
the alcoves the pattern forms runic circles, encompassing pentagrams of
black tiles.

A high-domed chamber rises above you in the gloom.  Lit by two huge
braziers at the base of the wide stairway, the rough stone walls of the
chamber seem to glow with a dull, heavy red, and the high dome of the
ceiling is bathed in dancing shadows.  The pillars of pale stone support the
dome, and are capped with intricately decorated entablatures, too distant to
be discerned in the fitful light.  An archway leads through the western
wall, while a great stairway of marble rises from the center of the room and
through and archway high in the eastern wall.

A passageway leads to the east and west beneath a high, arched ceiling. 
The grey stone walls are lined with pedestals supporting busts, both human
and otherwise, carved in fine marble.  Each pedestal bears a small plaque of
gold.  Between the pedestals, long torches hang at an angle from the wall,
bound by iron holders, and their red flames send spires of pale smoke to
darken the ceiling.  The hallway opens to the east and west into larger

A domed chamber of dark limestone opens here, dimly lit by the blue light
from a series of small lanterns which hang from the ceiling.  In the center
of the chamber a large, circular pool is filled with steaming water, from
which a sultry heat rises.  The chill air from the open archway to the west
sends wisps of steam swirling around the room.  About the edge of the pool
are lined several vials containing a variety of ointments, oils and elixirs.
Next to the western archway is a tall stand for hanging clothing.

The wide stairway opens into a high-domed chamber, erupting from the dark
tunnel high up in the eastern wall.  The stairway descends steeply to the
center of the chamber, where it is washed in the flickering red glow of two
burning braziers, which girdle the base of the stone stairs.  The high dome
of the chamber, dimly visible in the red light, appears to be heavily
decorated.  Where discernable, the designs are monstrous - strange beings,
assuredly demonic, traipse about the architraves and the ribs of the dome
with posturings both violent and obscene.  The stairway continues to rise
beyond the darkness of the eastern arch.

This well-equipped laboratory has been laid out in this bluestone
chamber.  Well-lit with several shining lanterns hanging from the low-domed
ceiling, a huge array of oddly shaped glassware gleams from around the
walls.  The northern wall holds a densely stacked bookshelf, with old, thick
tomes wedged amongst piles of note parchment.  A bench against the northern
wall is equipped everything needed for the casting of runes and the forging
of enchanted items.  Beneath this bench are stacked several small cages,
each holding one or more scrawny looking animals.  Another larger bench
against the southern wall, equipped with clamps for wrists, ankles and head,
is clearly intended for larger experimental subjects.  A stone archway leads
through the western wall.

Deep beneath the foundations of the halls above, this chamber is hewn
from the very rock of the hills' roots.  Bluestone buttresses hold the
cavern's roof aloft, forming four huge arches which intersect in an
eight-pointed star above you.  Small stalactites hang from the bluestone,
and the occasional drip of water echoes through the cavern.  In the very
center of this space, a large pentagram has been carved into the stone
floor, its center superimposed with a great trigon.  The symbol is scored
throughout with graven runes, each harsh upon the eye, and abstruse symbols
of unclear, yet certainly unwholesome function.  An iron door, also scored
with runes, is set into the eastern wall.

A wide, low-roofed chamber stretches before you, the shallow vaults of
its ceiling supported by four plain, sturdy pillars toward the center of the
room.  The walls are of rough bluestone, and the pillars and arches of
unadorned granite.  About the walls of the room are set stone platforms in
tiered crescents, forming arena-style seating.  The wide floorspace of the
arena itself is being used as a training ground for several warriors.  The
stone tiers are broken by archways in the north, south and west walls.

This cavernous room seems to form part of the foundations of the halls
above.  Set in the hollows of two massive supporting arches, this space has
been converted into a workshop for the extraction of pain.  Several long
benches are scattered about the expansive floor, equipped with manacles and
clamps, and a winch at each end.  Manacles also hang from the bluestone
arches, and one set hangs through a pully from the roof, above a similar set
of ankle-irons.  A table stands near the center of the room, neatly arrayed
with a surprisingly delicate collection of implements.  A small, dark
archway in the west wall is set with a heavy oaken door.  To one side of
this door a small, black recess gapes.  A winding stairway begins its upward
climb to the north. In the floor a locked iron grate leads to a dungeon cell.

Only a faint, red light illuminates this deep cell from the grill set
into the ceiling high above.  The limestone walls seem to ooze moisture, and
in many places the floor is covered with puddles of freezing water.  A few
mounds of mouldering straw strewn near the walls provide scant relief from
the cold, hard floor.  Manacles hang from three of the four walls, and in a
few of these the decomposing remains of forgotten prisoners slowly crumble
away.

Shadows dance madly upon the rough, silver-veined marble of the walls
which close about you, their form and motion defined by the flickering light
of a dizzying array of candles.  The luminaries, while ranging from slender,
tapered bodies near the fore, to the thick, imposing monuments of wax nearer
the eastern wall, are uniformly dark in tone.  Arranged in concentric
circles and each bearing an apparently unique sigil, they range from a deep
crimson in the outer strata to a black of most uncanny depth within.  At the
center of the room, a deeply-stained block of oak pierces upward through the
candles' shroud, its surface overlaid with bronze.  Above it, a tarnished
silver censer swings from a weighty steel chain, acrid smoke trickling from
its pores to flow across the unsympathetic glyph scored into the altar's
surface, and into a silver bowl of blood in front.  

To the west a velvet curtain hangs, offering concealment from the hall
outside.

a large and small rune.  Near the center is the smaller rune, which is one
of the ancient signs of the Void.  Around and atop this rune is the larger,
which is dedicated to the Dragon.

distance, jagged detritus bound to vast tendrils of flowing energy.  The
filaments converge on a single point of focus - a redly-pulsing glow some
great distance below you, inasmuch as such directions have meaning here.  

Before you, the red glow begins to take form, as though the vast distances
separating you from it had evaporated in an instant.  You hang, immobile,
far above an immense city - or so you assume it to be, although it resembles
no other city in existence.  It is formed entirely of monumental spires of
volcanic glass, which bristle upward in their thousands from a vast mass of
viscous magma and burning black slag.  The lower parts of the great spires
are, particularly towards the rim of the city, heated to a molten glow,
while their upper reaches vary in texture from twisting bundles of glassy
fibre to thick, reflective slabs of rock.  

Each and every tower in the city seems to be riddled with tunnels, as well
as forming the foundation for hundreds of iron structures.  These
ubiquitous, ugly extentions cling squatly against the glassy surfaces or
rise like sharp, metallic fangs into the void above.  Rust-coloured iron
bridges connect adjacent spires, or in some places leap high above the
surface of the city in precarious highways.  And across these highways, and
in the vapid air between the spires, and, indeed, everywhere you look, roam
the miriad denizens of the city, the thousand breeds of demonkind who are
the citizens of the void city Logor.  

The entire city seems to be in a state of violent, dynamic flux.  As you
watch, a spire near the rim quakes and then topples, shattering several of
its neighbours as it collapses into the magma.  Iron bridges twist and snap,
hurling hundreds, perhaps thousands of demons into the ruin.  Fragments
topple from the rim, joining the ragged streamers which stretch off into the
void.  You see now that the lava spilling downward from the ruin joins a
long stream of many tendrils which trails off from the base of the city.  It
is with some disconcertion that you realise that the bulk of these tendrils
are not formed by similar spillages of lava, but are of a fleshy, organic
nature, bearing a resemblance to the poisonous filaments of some monstrous
jellyfish, or to the ravaged, trailing guts of a disemboweled beast.  

You now view the city from below, where a great, pulpy, bleeding mass forms
its base.  As you watch the gruesome, cosmic horror thresh its way through
the void, one of the thinner tendrils whips across you, binding you in its
sticky fold.  You black out once more as you are slowly sucked upward and
into the city.  

When you come to, you are still staring down at the graven altar, with the
Sigil of Logor seared forever into your nightmares.

#ED_KEY logor
#ED_DES Inscribed into the tarnished surface of the altar is a blackened symbol -
the fell Sigil of Logor, dedicating this shrine to the void city and its
infernal inhabitants.  The border of the Sigil of Logor is an uneven
pentagram, its sides thick and bold.  The interior is filled, but broken by
a large and small rune.  Near the center is the smaller rune, which is one
of the ancient signs of the Void.  Around and atop this rune is the larger,
which is dedicated to the Dragon.  

The symbol seems to throb with an unworldly power.  Perhaps a deeper insight
could be gleaned by studying it.

#ED_DES Staring down at the brazen altar, your full focus is quickly captured by
the glaring sigil on its surface.  Manifestly a Symbol of Power, this
rendering of the Sigil of of Logor courses with eldritch energies.  You find
yourself stooped over the altar, your whitening knuckles clenched to its
edges.  As the acrid smoke of the censer seizes your lungs, you find
yourself blacking out.  

And everything is darkness.  

It seems as though you float in the darkness, surrounded by a deathly,
stagnant chill which gnaws at your flesh.  You quickly realise that the void
is not complete.  Great filaments of material stretch across the bleak
distance, jagged detritus bound to vast tendrils of flowing energy.  The
filaments converge on a single point of focus - a redly-pulsing glow some
