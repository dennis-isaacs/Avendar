#DESCRIPTION Ssenkhatha stands as a mass of tightly-corded muscle, bulging sickeningly
as he flexes through movement.  His scaled figure is huge, dominating, and
covered with scarring gashes, nicks and grazes.  A cruel, many-toothed maw
opens and closes, while a thin pinkish-black tongue flicks in and out
beckoningly, arrogantly.  His limbs are thick with strength, powerful and
sturdy.  A tail, beginning as thick as his waist and slimming to a simple
point, lashes out slowly behind him as a cruel, living whip.  

Achieving his strength through the dominance of his lessers, Ssenkhatha has
proven himself time and time again, and has so earned the respect, or at
least acknowledgement, of both his foes and fellow Elders.  His imposing
figure, so huge in proportion to the other srryn, is quite unnatural, his
muscle, speed and ability rumored to be passed to him from the immortal
Sythrak in a show of favor.

muscular despite his wiry figure.  A pair of black-slit yellow eyes gaze
about cautiously.  His wiry look offers hints of unrivaled grace and
ability, which he puts further emphasis on with his every move, gesture and
work.  A toned middle extends down into two long, slender legs, balanced in
a careful stance.  A tail extends from behind him, wrapping itself around
his waist protectively, as if to avoid getting in the way.  

The Elder Rogue for quite a time, Thenseltha is known for his careful
plotting and vicious, calculated strikes.  Among the most deadliest of Elder
Rogues in recent history, his ability and cunning is unmatched by any under
him at this time, further securing his hold on the position.

#NAME ssithikka elder srryn slender jade-scaled
#ALIGN -500 0
#DESCRIPTION A slender figure plated with glistening jade scales, this srryn appears
at ease with her surroundings, and yet stanced in a most unusual offensive
fashion.  Her black-slit yellow eyes scan her surroundings lazily, seemingly
anticipating nothing, while her cruel maw is twisted in some wicked grin,
baring her well-kept razor sharp teeth.  She wears a darkened iron armor
over her well-built form, a most uncommon sight of metal in the murk of the
swamps, the dull surface decorated with scratched-out runes.  Behind her, a
thin, swift-moving tail flicks slowly in the air, appearing in every
interest to keep itself from the soiling muddy ground.  

Ssithikka is the wicked embodiment of the Thissa, the sect of Void Templars
of Sythtys, and the sole blood of the fallen Potentate Usthriykss.  It is
she who outlined and initiated the downfall of the templar Fensalthella and
stole the emptied position of Elder Templar for the serpent-marked members
of the Thissa, offering a new age to Sythtys.  Her influence on the magical
studies has been wide, with many turning from Fire to Void, seeking out the
wealth of power Ssithikka so preaches of, to be a part of the Thissa's dark
future.

dozens of cages that hang above.  A twisted maw of jagged, yellow-brown
teeth draws attention to his single eye, a glistening, white-rimmed yellow. 
His figure is immense, bulky, with muscle clearly evident in his hulkish
presence.  A giant amongst the srryn around him, he takes clear advantage of
this, allowing torment to be extended his lessers as well as the prisoners. 
A thick black, white-circled tail extends behind him in a bulky mass,
dragging along the ground with his move.

Dressed in hardly anything, rotting hides and blackening bone necklaces, it
lives only to serve Siyauz'grak.  Sharp serrated claws jut out of each
finger, hanging menacingly from its hand.  Rotting flesh hangs loose from
corners of bone and limbs, a sickening stench wafting from each half-decayed
peice.

recognizable as a creature until its front is identified.  A toad of
horrific dimensions lies here.  A great pair of eyes loll about its
surroundings, a maw large enough to swallow a man whole underneath.  Its
sickly black-green flesh crawls with swarms of tiny young, both above and
below its skin 

Seeming to be immobile, the abberation gives the impression of basking in
some blasphemous power.

own curse by the Elders.  Yet, this is not so.  Before his curse, he was
enslaved by myself.  He now rests as the blood child of myself, forced to
obey my word.  His soul is so tainted by his actions, so reliant on the
negative energy fed to him by the Void...  He will enjoy resting in the
bloodflow of that energy, I would think.  The very lake he polluted will be
his life, and will serve his strength until he is summoned once more to do
my bidding.  Soon...  The very words spoken to summon, safe only to those of

#DESCRIPTION The formation began soon after we returned into the deep swamps, further
from the warmblood worms.  Five, taken under my wing, learned the ways of
which I had been taught by Thiaj'(unknown).  Quickly, they discovered the
ways of forcing negative energy from the Void plane and into our realm,
converting it from undirected power into a steady stream.  This was well. 
The six of us formed what is the Thissa sept, training our kin for use of
the void in battle.  One interests me, however.  Siyauz'grak, his name is. 
He has talent in the Void, and has proven this.  This will be interesting,
teaching him.  Very interesting.

#DESCRIPTION As the battle ravaged within the muddy confines of Sythtys, I watched. 
Hardly knowing, still learning.  Fire was thrown, and foes demolished. 
Blades met the colored scales, and the Srryn fell.  Pain wracked every point
of their bodies, and yet I felt nothing.  They did not know.  And so I
touched the murky blackness, wielding it as shown to me by Thiaj'(unknown). 
Every black word that slipped from my forked tongue, every delicate gesture
of my black-scaled hands.  They were mine, and mine only.  With one massive
burst of negative energy, 20 men were obliterated where they stood.  The
rest halted combat, fear driving through their hearts like a hot iron spike.
Even my precious srryn stood motionless, watching me.  Licking my lips, I
snarled softly.  These very warmbloods dared to tresspass on our grounds,
unknowing of our power.  They would not live.  Not one.  And so we advanced.

if any, was put into the creation of this structure, and it looks to simply
have been thrown together in a rush.  While it appears sturdy enough to
dwell in, it does not appear as if it could withstand even a weak storm.  A
single exit to the south offers passage back out into the greenish-brown
fields of the murky swamp.

border the swamps.  A light mist flows about the ground beneath you, and
lingers between the damp leaves of the ferns and mottled plantlife that
begin to grow 'round this area.  A marker has been set on a nearby stump; a
single band of berry-dyed leather that appears to be nailed down.  Further
to the south, the ground becomes thick with a vile brown mud as the lowlands
shift into swamplands.  To the north, the grasslands spread out.

with crudely-made buckets partially filled with water and half-worked pieces
scattered about around it.  A number of dented armors lie in a pile near the

around the muddy trail, kept alive only by the small amount of light peeking
through the twisted-bark trees that rise up around you.  The swamps extend
to the north, east and west.  A small trail leads around the fallen tree to
the south, disappearing into a mass of tangled vines and thick-leaved brush.

#DESCRIPTION The lake is a sickly dark green, faint shadows of underwater life visible
through the calm waters.  Mist rises above the water, fogging your vision of
the surrounding area.  Trees hang high above the lake, their mossy branches
reaching down, almost touching the surface.  Decaying wood floats along the
lake, the slight breeze edging it along the water.  To the west, the lake
ends at a muddy trail.

swamp.

A canopy of lurid, flowering vines can be seen through the roof, where a

#DESCRIPTION A thick black smoke swirls in the warm air around you, wafting up from a
dark-burning firepit in the center of this dark place.  Broken and
soot-covered bones are scattered about, fashioned with rough bark and vine
into fetishes, mixing in with fragrant dried herbs and fiery-red flowers
that pepper the ground.  Behind the soft-crackling firepit, rising up into
the air, is a dull, mud-speckled stone statue of a great saurian, cracked
and covered with thick vines that wrap around the dark wood in a strangling
hold.  Around you, the thick plantlife rises up in all directions,
effectively barring sight and movement through.  

At the base of the stone statue, a dried circle of hardened black earth is
surrounded by rune-scored rocks.  In the very center of the circle, a
deeply-dug hole sits idle, almost as if it were waiting to be filled.

#KEYWORDS  stone saurian statue
#DESCRIPTION Towering above you stands a dark, black statue carved from a glossy,
ebony stone.  It is molded into a heavily armed, hooded srryn.  Upon first
glance, the stone does not appear to be a lifeless object in the room,
rather a frozen form of a living being.  A long cloak drapes over broad
shoulders, and falls evenly to the knees.  The only hint of color beams from
deep under the hood, in what appear to be the most intense, flaming, yellow
eyes you have ever seen.  Sharp, jagged teeth can be seen when focused on
through the shadows of the hood.  His stout, bare chest reveals a number of
deep scars, gained from a lifetime a battle in his time.  Each break in
armor reveals defined, bulgy muscles shaped with unparalleled strength.  

A break is made in this magestic frame, as you realize that there is a large
hole penetrating through his skull.  An inscription at the base of the
statue reads: Here is Sskilgar, once Dreadlord, forever failure of Sythrak.

down from the top of the hole, sending large globs of the thick, brown
substance falling to the bottom of the underground passage.  Below, the
muddy floor of the underground cave is in view.

pale blanket.  The blackish-gray mud holds few tracks, if any, along its
progress in covering the ground, suggesting this as a rarely travelled
route.  A thick plantlife rises up through most of the way, hindering
movement greatly.  The air appears more wet here, carrying with it a stench
most unbearable that appears to be wafting in from the south, where a small,
black-watered lake rests quietly.

#DESCRIPTION The surrounding foliage is unnaturally dense, and hangs all around you;
mottled-green ferns droop onto what could be called a trail, as noted by the
various bipedal footprints that have worn the mud down.  Above you, branches
hang down, heavy with leaves, vines and hole-riddled blankets of soft green.
Only small streams of light manage to find their way into this heated cage,
which is slick with a crystal-clear dew.  To the east, darker path leads
deeper into the murky depths of the swamp.

dwell in, it does not appear as if it could withstand even a weak storm.  

A collection of lumped-together pieces of bark-heavy swampwood rest in the
corner of the hut, acting as a holding place for the crude 'jars' of dried,
wrapped leaves and thick vines that hold various herbs, mud-pastes and
ground bones.  A firepit is dug into the wet ground in the center of the
hut, surrounded by a thick border of thin, black-speckled bones.  To the
south, a hole in the front-surface of the hut leads back out into the swamp.

gorgets and trepanning tools protrude from the water at odd angles,
alongside bloodied forceps, bone saws and scalpels, all rusting away.  In
the center of the chamber is an examination table, bearing a large skeleton.

A heavy-lintelled doorway leads to the east, while a hole in the roof leads

draped with sheaths of clinging algae.  The skeleton seems relatively
undamaged, as though its owner had escaped the most brutal ministrations of
this laboratory's former masters.  

The table itself is formed from a lopsided tressel of hardwood, its rusty
iron legs slowly sinking into the muddy floor.  Its surface has been gouged
with deep, black-stained runnels, which seem designed to channel fluids
along the surface to a hole at the patient's feet.  A ceramic bowl hangs

#DESCRIPTION As you study the infernal script of the inscription, you feel your

You suddenly jerk back to your senses, floating amidst an alien dreamscape. 
All at once your surroundings are both familiar and unknown.  Shapes and
memories float about you, voices- both known and mysterious- echo about from
every corner.  You find yourself flying through it with a feeling of calm
wonderment.  

You continue to travel deeper into the dream and begin to note that your
surroundings have taken a darker cast.  Faces seem twisted and mocking while
places you once knew are now dark and tainted.  As you try to puzzle out the
meaning of these dark visions, a chill runs unbidden down your spine.  

You feel your essence suddenly snatched elsewhere, the visions of the dream
blurring with travel.  Sensation quickly returns as you feel yourself fall
roughly onto stony ground.  

You stagger to your feet trying to identify the nightmare before you.  Walls
of jagged red-black stone rise in the horizon and the air holds an acrid
quality.  You try and take to the skies again, to return to your dreams, but
you realize with blood-freezing certainty you cannot.  

Dark, reptilian shapes begin to dart from the shadows at the corners of your
vision, gone as you turn to look.  You're granted precious little time to
ponder this as you feel scaled hands grasping your arms, seizing you.  Your
panicked gaze meets the slitted pupils of scaled and toothed horrors,
grinning hungrily even as you struggle in vain.  

Another demon steps from the shadows, raising a claw to strike.  You feel
the razor-tipped digits dig deep into the soft flesh of your underbelly, and
watch in pain-wracked horror as your intestines are drawn out.  You sag in
the grasp of the demons, blood running as a torrent from the gash, trying
desperately to awake.  

You are suddenly again within the cave, the crest of Chaigidon seared into
your mind.

through the many holes in the crude-crafted walls.  The air inside the hut
is smoky, and fresh with the smell of recently-caught game.  Little detail,
if any, was put into the creation of this structure, and it looks to simply
have been thrown together in a rush.  While it appears sturdy enough to
dwell in, it does not appear as if it could withstand even a weak storm.  To
the south, the hut opens up into a smoke-filled clearing.

#NAME A Murky Swamp
#DESCRIPTION All around you, the swamp extends as a field of greenish-brown, marked by
only some minor difference; the brownish-grey mud, heavily-marked and patted
down by the travel of what appears to be a bipedal species, appears in sharp
contrast to the vibrant orange-violet colors of the flower and herb-speckled
bushes and trees.  Trees, with twisted-bark surfaces, rise up around you,
with odd-shaped branches dangling vines and other fallen plantlife over the
area.  

Above you, cages of hard swampwood dangle from the long, sturdy branches of
the trees like ripe fruit, darkened by soot and, occasionally, a deep
crimson splattering, a dried stain, on their already darkened surfaces.  The
area seems to serve as the breeding ground of a horrible stench.
