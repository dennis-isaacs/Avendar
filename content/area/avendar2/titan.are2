Darken Reaches. They preyed upon humans and other sentient races, and it
is said that the terror they inflicted through their ravages fed them as
much as the flesh that they rent from innocent bones. Once entrenched in
an area, the khil'ayum are nearly impossible to exterminate, as their evasive
capabilities are formidable. Several centuries ago they spread across many
lands, and the Titans finally intervened. Now the remainder of their kind
is locked in the Astral Prison.

menaced the Light throughout time. Once confined for 300 years by a mage
of Istilail, he escaped by catching his jailor off guard and devouring him.
Xthjich then gathered an army of the vilest powers and lead his forces to
the destruction of the Iilim, a peaceful and gentle race. He met with the
forces of light at Anda, where he was struck down by the Titan Captain
Oradan, and sealed in this prison.

#LORE These are the robes of Gyel-Xan, leader of the spawn of Sothmogga.  The

of the Celanim, corrupted by the passing of that cosmic horror.  Long did
the spawn continue the menace the Celanim, until they were nearly completely
exterminated by the celestial essence of Converu, the same templar who
banished Sothmogga.  

Gyel-Xan, mightiest and most cunning of his kind, lead a clutch of his
brethren away from his home plane when the finding of the Chalice of Jolinn
cause a dimensional disturbance which opened up a portal to the prime
material.  Long foreseen by his sinister auguries, Gyel-Xan was well
prepared for this day, arriving in Avendar armed with an arsenal of
nefarious magics.  

He used an artifact known as the Orb of Illusions to obscure the Titans from
the world at large, resulting in the widespread fear that their great kind
had departed Avendar entirely.  Distracting the forces of the light with the
release of a demon lord of some potency, he manipulated events to acquire
the last remaining page of the Nyakigh Sha Yith, along with the mystical
power needed for his plan.  

Convincing the rest of his sect that he actually meant to free Sothmogga,
Gyel-Xan began poisoning humans with Sothmogga's taint, and proceeded to
encircle the Titan castle, with the heedless Titans still blind to the
world.  Little did his followers realize, however, that Gyel-Xan had no
desire to free Sothmogga instead, he sought to drain Sothmogga's power
completely, instead becoming the cosmic horror himself!  

Fortunately, a group of Champions found the Orb of Illusions in Gyel-Xan's
secluded lair, and broke it on Anirim's throne, releasing the Titans. 
Seeing his plans unravel, Gyel-Xan drew on Sothmogga's power recklessly,
failing to realize that in doing so, he would be trapped in the same spell
which bound Sothmogga in the astral prison.  His sect and demon army were
defeated, and Gyel-Xan shared the same fate as his progenitor: eternity
sealed away from the world under the care of the Titans.

magesty and power.  The walls are hung with flawless tapestries, the
stonework of the ceiling is of breathtaking skill, and the floor is carpeted
in a wonderous rug of deep crimson.  The Room is furnished with rich
couches, cushioned with the finest of silk pillows.  To the far north of the

the Titan King gives council to the troubled of the world.

#DESCRIPTION You reel, as you no longer see the confines of the astral cell.  



You stand on a dark plain, glaring through a yellowed eye onto the field of
a vast battle.  Ahead of you, and all around sinister and eldritch horrors
seethe and roil, part of a great host.  At their head, the monstrous demon
general Xthjich leads the abominations in a surging swarm of pure force.  

He turns, to stare at you, and you are ensnared by his gaze.  His claws tear
the air, and he roars.  You cannot look away, though, and are drawn into his
eyes.  Their dark pits consume the entire scene, and, horrifyingly, you are
lost in their exquisite emptiness.....  



The vision clears, and the Eye of Xthjich has burned itself onto the weave
of your mind.

#DESCRIPTION The eye of Xthjich is the canonical pentagram, but with a stylized and

surrounded by lines representing radiant fire in the various branches of the
pentagram.  

This particular symbol is burnt into the floor of the near invulnerable
astral cell.  You might more learn more of it if you were to study it.
