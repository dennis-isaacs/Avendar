#DESCRIPTION A perfect likeness of a man. It seems, when he was carved, he was working
with a large piece of stout oak... it is attached to his right hand. In his
left is a wooden knife, for shaping wood. The model was tall, with a tough-
looking body, as if he gathered his own working materials by cutting down
the trees himself.

wood. His hands are grained, showing old callouses upon new callouses from
working with the material he is now represented in. He wears a robe, belted
tight around his waist, which seems to flow even though it cannot. The 
statue's eyes, however, seem oddly alert.

scrawny, and his robes hang off of them.

tall from many years spent at the forge and hammer, hours of pumping bellows
and shaping tools. His face looks as if it would be hard even in the flesh. A
jagged scar adorns his muscular forearm, each wrinkle plainly visible. This
statue is a true master metalwork.

in the task. His stern countenance brooks no misbehaving in his classroom: you
will learn the craft or be set out.

#DESCRIPTION Endenday, 10th day of Valectis
I have arrived in a grand city, deep in the Brintors.  The city is
located in a valley of trees, and is surrounded by a thick stone wall almost
three men high.  The gate I entered is in the southern wall, and it appears
to be the only one.  Stone and wood buildings line the streets, some houses,
some shops.  The largest building of them all is a tower that seems to rises
high above the city and surrounding trees.  Its surface looks to be some
smooth rock, but I could not determine the type.  The human inhabitants are
amiable enough that I have secured room and board for the night, and at a
minimum of cost.  Tomorrow, we shall see what the rest of the city holds.

After visiting the marketplace, it would seem that there are three main
trades here: wood, metal, and stoneworking.  From what I see, their work is
of exceptional quality and is quite appealing to the eye...  I was shown
several pieces that rival many I've seen in nobles' homes, even those of
Ilodaiya itself.  Oddly, or perhaps not so oddly, enough, I have seen no
armor or weaponry.  Another interesting point is that all that they sell
would bring several times their cost in profit, were I to sell them in Var
Bandor or Earendam.  Hmmm.  Perhaps it is time to set up a shop... 

Nah.

Off to bed, now.

They do make weapons here after all.  Near the west side of the city,
there is a woodsmans' guild, where perhaps twenty or thirty men visit before
their excursions into the surrounding forests and mountains.  Their axes are
of the same quality as the rest of the city's products.  Around mid-morning,
they left in a group for the forest. 

As I continued to explore the city, I found a miners' guild as well. 
Noone was in at the time, but the few pieces of mining equipment that were
left behind were, again, of the same quality as the rest of the items I'd
seen.  I left, to avoid being marked suspicious, and wandered until a group
of townsfolk recognized me and invited me to share a cup of ale.  I shall
try this, and write again tomorrow.

Unfortunately, the citizens of Shendaer have as bland a palate in ales as
I had seen in the food.  It's tolerable, but nothing remarkable.  I find
this odd, considering the originality and aesthetic appeal of everything
else they make.  Or perhaps they throw themselves into their other work, and
pay no attention to more than base sustenance.

Their conversation is just as dull...  Talk of mining, woodcutting, and
crafting for the entire night.  They were certainly absorbed, but I was less
so.  Perhaps I shall move on sooner than I thought.

I did hear one interesting tidbit, though..  Apparently, the woodsmen
feel the forest is growing faster.  Such drivel, however, is to be expected
from those of their trade.  Perhaps tomorrow I can learn something
interesting about their tower.

Today, I spent my time asking about the tower, as I felt comfortable
enough with a few of the inhabitants to hold a discussion.  The tower is
their center of learning and training.  I have seen a few people go into the
tower clutching papers.  These are students that have been invited for
instruction by the masters within.

The townspeople do occasionally interact with the tower.  Apparently, the
best products of each month are brought to the tower, and the choicest of
these are taken within.  There, noone knows what actually goes on, but
sometimes the objects are returned from the tower with strange powers and
properties.  Perhaps the students, or the masters themselves, in the tower
enchant the items.  These items, when sold, are still within the budget of
the meanest Aelin family, although significantly more expensive than the
rest.  Perhaps, someday, I shall see this tower for myself.

Drat and damnation!  Never in my life have I been so insolently treated! 
I will never return to this city again, for certain.  I will write more
later, as my guards are returning.

(later)

As I was resourceful enough to keep my journal and quill, I shall write
of my recent mishap.  I was in the marketplace, and working my way through
the crowd, when I saw a man come from the south.  He purchased several
items, and headed back to the south, toward the gates.  As I had my
belongings, I decided it was time to leave, and rushed ahead of him to lay
in wait near the road.  He was quicker than I thought, and when I attempted
to hit the back of his head, he turned and I caught his cheek instead.  He
started yelling and screaming, and before I could slit his throat, or even
run, I was surrounded by glowering woodcutters with their axes drawn.  They
took me into the city, and led me to the tower doors.  I was forced inside
by several of them, who immediately shut the door behind me.  Of course, it
was locked when I turned around.

Shortly afterwards, a couple of young humans dressed in robes came down a
staircase, and arranged themselves in a semicircle in front of me.  At the
end of their procession was an elegantly dressed woman with a stern
countenance, who entered the circle as the others moved aside.  She accused
me of attempting to ambush a merchant near the city walls.  I was forced to
admit to the crime, much to my dismay, due to the number of witnesses. 
Also, I hoped my sentence would be lightened.  I've been in jails before,
and had no interest in exploring the ones here.  She gestured to two of the
young ones, who took me by my arms and led me to the spiral staircase at the
end of the hall.  One opened a trapdoor in the floor while the other led me
to it, and shoved me down!  Preposterous!  My pack was taken from me, as
well as the one dagger I carry visibly.  After landing rather hard at the
bottom of the ladder, I heard the grating of the trapdoor being resealed.  I
struck a light from some flint I had concealed in a pocket, and found myself
in a small cellar with a ladder on the north wall.  There was nothing but a
few wooden chests which, on closer inspection, bore the seals of several
powerful houses, including that of the Casidian family itself.  I will
examine these further at a later time..  As I am sure I will has plenty of
opportunities.  For now, I will rest.

I have been listening to the guards above me through the trapdoor.  Most
of their talk was of an item that had been given to their care, a small
sphere carved from wood.  Apparently they were enchanting it to enhance the
wearer's health and mental energies.  The talk was mostly gibberish to me,
but I was able to catch a few phrases here and there.

I have been breaking the chests, save for that of the Casidian family,
and kindled the wood into small fires.  The wood is dry, and fortunately
little enough smoke is emitted.  The room heats quickly, as it is small, and
I have had just enough time to write this entry.  It would seem I don't
warrant food or water...  I must escape soon before my strength flags
overmuch.

The guards' talk has changed.  Now, they speak of horrors outside the

them from the ground."  Rubbish, I'm sure, to demoralize me.  At least their
talk has changed.  They speak of the mass slaughter of the woodsmen that
captured me...  Good riddance to them.

I have only a few chests left to burn.  At least there is some sort of
opening in this hole, though I cannot find it, as the air stays fresh, if
slightly smoky.  I must escape soon, or the gnawing in my belly will consume
me.

All is quiet above.  I have not heard a sound for several hours, other
than the rumbling in my belly.  I have to chance it, have to try to get out,
or I will die in here.  I'm on my last few splinters of wood other than the
Casidian chest, which I will be taking if I can get away with it.  If it is
as I suspect up there, in the tower, I will find no opposition should I
decide to take other things as well. 

Perhaps I can also find a larder.  If not, I may not be able to get the
chest out anyways.  My strength has ebbed considerably.

What did these people eat?  I can't find a larder, or kitchen, or even a
fountain.  I am glad I am writing this and not speaking it...  My mouth is
too dry.  I have visited every level of this tower and there is nothing, not
on the ground floor, or any of the four above it.  I have seen nothing of my
captors...  Rather, I've seen nothing living or dead of my captors.

I have seen their forms, but they are now statues of wood, metal, or
stone, depending on which floor of the tower they were on.  The second floor
contains wooden statues, including those of my captors.  I would have paid
my respects to them, but I could not work up the spit in my mouth.  I also
found the wooden sphere they were talking of, but I could not loosen it from
the hand of the statue that carried it.  The third floor contained
metalworking equipment and materials, and the statues inhabiting it were of
metal themselves.  The fourth floor contained stone statues.  One of them
held a chisel of diamond, and try as I might, I could not get that free
either.  If I had more time, I would definitely gain that, as it must be
worth a king's ransom.  The top floor houses only two statues, the woman who
originally had me detained, and another outside her door, whom I had to kill
to get in the lady's room.  She had nothing of value that I could see in her
chambers, although I did see the faint outline of a trapdoor in her ceiling.
I would have explored that, but the hunger pains gripped my stomach quite
harshly, and I went back down the stairs emptyhanded but for a few bars of
gold, and a few beaded necklaces, which must have some special properties,
as they are in the tower.  I will rest here as well as I can, and leave when
I wake.

Disaster...  Utter disaster.  I opened the doors, and beheld a sight most
frightening.  All of the town is destroyed, save the tower.  The walls
surrounding the town have crumbled to near dust, and the buildings mostly
flattened.  Several men and women were outside hurling stones and fists at
each other.  Two of the men rushed me, and I ran back into the tower and
slammed the doors.  There is no chance of leaving with the chest, so I have
placed it back in the cellar where I was held.  The key is nearby. I will 
place this journal in the chest in hopes that someone will read it and hear
of my plight, and this account of what has happened here.  Hopefully, it 
won't come to that, if I can keep my wits about me and my feet under me as
I make another foray into the ruins. I have to eat, and it must be soon.  I
will rest a bit, and try again shortly.  Perhaps I will make it out, and 
lead a patrol of Aelin in to gather the remaining things here I must now 
leave behind.

May Hope stay in sight.

day they were made, smooth as polished ivory.  Here, the mural on the
western wall shows large walls, about man-high, growing as the stonemasons
build upon it.  The eastern wall shows a scaffold-embraced tower, about half
complete.  A spiral staircase is to the north, and to the south is the
hallway.

paper and charcoal to draw with.  A bed is made, in the corner, but doesn't
look as if it has been often used.  The latest work of the stonemason is on
his desk, awaiting his crafting touch again.

#DESCRIPTION This room is neat, for the most part.  The floor is clean, and the
hammers and chisels hanging on the walls are rust-free, the chisels sharp. 
A large table contains a number of small vises with hand-cranks to hold
pieces while they are shaped.  A grinding wheel is set to the side, the
foot-pedal depressed to the ground.  Oddly, the stone shows no signs of
wear...  It must have been recently replaced.

#NAME A Hall at the Top of the Tower
#DESCRIPTION One continuous string of etched and polished gold adorns the white marble
walls of this hallway.  The curved and pointed leaves seem to waver as the
light flashes around them, as if a steady breeze wafted through the
corridor.  The line of pure yellow narrows, and travels straight as the
marble stretches east.  An ebony door, highly polished, glints gently, with
no other feature than it's smooth surface.

#NAME A Bedroom
#DESCRIPTION A large bedchamber opens up before you, almost the width of the whole of
the Tower.  A desk sits against one wall, with charcoal pencils and stacks
of blank paper nearby.  Shelves of neatly-arranged books line the walls: a
quick glance shows them to be books about enchantment and transfer of
magical power.  A simple but elegantly designed bed sits in one corner, made
for the day.
