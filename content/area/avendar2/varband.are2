#DESCRIPTION A frail, aged aelin robed in a white laboratory smock, Bai'soco's short
hair is grizzled and grey.  A long, thin face, scarred by past mishaps,
contains a pair of piercingly bright grey eyes which dart about with a
shrewd, discerning look.  Veined hands still possess an extraordinary
deftness and subtlety, evidenced by his occasional manipulation of the many
pieces of equipment about the laboratory.  

A Master Alchemist, Bai'soco is the leader of the Var Bandor sect of the
alchemical guild, projected to his current status by his keen sense for
subtleties in both materials and in mortals.  Partially responsible for the
symbiosis between the Council of Scholars and the alchemists despite their
long-standing rivalry, he also spends his time instructing new students in
his own guild.

Dressed in the robes of an acolyte, he has yet to choose his sphere of
study, and watches over the meeting hall of the Council of Scholars to help
him make his decision.  Long, white hair tumbles down his back in a loose
plait, and a small moustache sits on his weathered, bark-like face.  Wide
shoulders and strong hands seem conditioned by some menial labor - perhaps
farming - and his brown skin is tanned far more than would usually befit a
person of scholarly disposition.

shells.  They vary greatly in size, and this one fills almost the entirety
of this part of the catacombs.  The black cave snails are extremely rare due
to their need for underground places that are warm, dark, secluded, and with
just the right amount of underground vegetation for them to consume.  The
supposed aphrodisiacal value of their shells, once ground into potions, has
also led to them being a prized bounty by people seeking a quick profit.

Spawn.  Originally one an unborn of the celestial race of the Celanim,
Gyel-Xan, like his fellow spawn, was twisted and corrupted by the coming of
that cosmic horror.  

Gyel-Xan stands about as tall as an alatharya, but his entire body is
covered by ropy, midnight-black tentacles.  An acidic sheen covers his skin,
and only magic prevents the dissolution of his dark silk robes.  Little
trace remains of his Celanimic heritage, save his eyes, which pulse with a
deep blue energy.

#DESCRIPTION This high priest of Sothmogga was once a human.  About half of his body
is covered with pallid, waxy flesh, which stinks of rotting meat.  The other
half is black, distended tissue, formed into tentacles of many shapes and
sizes.  In particular, his right hand has been completely replaced with a
dexterous, writhing appendage.  Underfoot, drippings of acid fall to the
floor to hiss at his feet.  

The priest wears robes of black silk, which ostensibly cover the infernal
motions of the thing, but in reality only accentuate the presence of
something inhuman beneath them.  Draped about his neck is a gold medallion,
carved into a brazen image of Sothmogga.

plates of midnight black chitin.  Thick, plated arms - replete with bony
serrations - hang by the gharku's side, ending in massive, black pincers,
capable of snapping a man in half.  The gharku's hulking weight rests upon
short, squat legs, each one bent ever so slightly at the joint.  The legs
extend onward into bony, clawed feet.  

A seemingly human skull, wrapped tightly in grey, decaying skin, rests atop
a stick of a neck, protruding only slightly forward from its hulking torso. 
Its jaw is set into a permanent grin, jagged and broken teeth, thrusting
forth from shriveled lips.  Bloodshot eyestalks erupt from the gharku's
empty sockets, endlessly swinging about in search of prey.

serrated and cruelly barbed, draped over the demon's form give forth an
unsettling clatter as they swing dangerously about, running over and through
the Nvae'gra's flesh, and drag along the ground.  

Beneath the shroud of iron, twin points of glowing red smoulder in the
sockets of a skull only partially covered by flesh.  Dark skin has peeled
away from the face of this creature, clinging to the lower jaw tautly,
attempting to hold fast to its last, razor-toothed purchase.

canine jaw, lined with a double-layer of smashed, jagged incisors.  Bounding
forward with each step, the Orzub's claws seem to whistle through the air
with ominous speed.

from some elderly maples in nearby Morn.  Its shiny surface belies the fact
that it isn't perfectly made, and sometimes happens to fall out of tune.  It
is extremely light due to its making, rendering it highly useful for

The markings in the Libram show evidence that King Gogoth researched the
writings of Dyabhua, a Priest of the ancient fallen demon god Xiganath,
early in the fourth decade of his rule. The Conjuration came to his
attention through these investigations, and it is clearly implied from
Ksathan's writings that His Majesty may not have set on that fateful
course if he had not been seeking the location of the Staff.

#LORE This ale is named after Bodisous Bofarin, a notorious bandit king. 
Originally hailing from the Brintors, Bodisous made a name for himself as an
adventurer and bandit, and is widely known in the city of Var Bandor and its
environs.  Avoiding serious altercations with the law, Bodisous achieved a
certain heroic reputation after stealing a fragment of a mei'tzec meteor
from the most powerful priest in Yithoul, later leading to the return of the
god Dolgrael to Avendar.  Taking his earnings from his adventures and his
reward from that altercation, he bought and rennovated a tavern on Aragol
Street, christening it the 'Beast and Bandit' tavern.  

The ale itself is a potent brew, and equal to the house brew of any tavern
in Var Bandor.

#DESCRIPTION The third, and final type of the immaterial demons known are the
so-called "unclean spirits".  Totally dark and immaterial, the area
surrounding these beings is generally cloaked in swaths of frigid air.  Pale
lights of lifeless blue shine from the depths of the demon, but these seem
primarily designed to intimidate, as they can sense living things in most
any environment.  

Little is known of the origins of this demon, but it has been conclusively
proven that powerful magic-using demon lords have been sighted with them in
attendance, or used by them as a herald for speaking through possessed
mortals.  Curiously, these defiled spirits were prominent in the court of
Xiganath, who was served by Nyogthua, one of the twin lords of demonic
magic.  One hypothesis accepted by many scholars is that the unclean spirits
are actually created from the souls of mortals, but in a crude, brutal
fashion, that copies the structure of the soul into a demonic matrix.  

The most powerful archmages can bind and control the unclean, forcing them
to serve at their side.  Like the devouring spirit, the unclean can be
ordered to possess enemies of the void scholar, assuming a partial command
of their body!  Those afflicted with the presence of an unclean spirit often
take up a similar demeanor and behavior, unwittingly becoming more like
their demonic master.  Holy ground becomes anathema to them, as does the
practitioners of various forms of positive energy.  Most alarmingly for the
victim of such an infiltration, the presence of a being of negative energy
within their minds leaves them vulnerable to command by practitioners of the
void.  

The tale is told of a minor king in the Rirro Jagka, who was afflicted in
secret by such a demon.  The cunning void scholar who used the spirit
ordered the king to appear in public, and admit that he had been dabbling in
the void.  Such was the public outcry that the spirit scholars were brought
in to test the king, who promptly went mad and attempted to murder them. 
Deposed and exiled, it was revealed that having no heirs, he had left the
kingdom to the void scholar.  And, by the time the demon had left the king,
he was living like an animal in the wilderness, and was promptly stoned when
he returned to his city.

#DESCRIPTION The second type of vaporous demon-essence is more powerful.  Known only
as the "tenebral horror", this spirit appears as a noxious, yellow mist, in
which dozens of all-too real jaws clatter mindlessly.  

Tenebral horrors are reputed to roam the streets of Logor, lurking in the
alleys and cul-de-saacs of that dread city.  There, they feast on what
smaller demons they can tear the flesh from, as well as the occasional
succulent mortal soul.  

Scholars who can manage to control these demons use their hunger for blood
to good advantage.  When bound, these demons will obligingly engulf
opponents of the scholar, their jaws feasting with abandon.  The wounds left
by the thing tend to fester, being unlike any normal wounds.  Care should be
taken that the scholar who conjures the horror does not become its victim.

#END_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION

#KEYWORDS  folio2
#DESCRIPTION Firstly, there is are the "devouring spirits", which seem to thrive in
the presence of the twin excesses of gluttony and starvation.  These spirits
are generally dark and wispy, and filled with insubstantial mouths, each
clamoring or reaching for some sustenance, forever unable to feed
themselves, as they have no form.  

While commonly fond in the torturous mazes of the Void, these spirits are
often called to serve by scholars.  Rather than fighting or serving some
immediate use, however, the wise scholar will keep such a spirit ate his
side until he encounters a likely victim.  At the time, he will order the
spirit to actually possess his target!  

Victims afflicted by the mental presence of the spirit will be consumed with
a ravening hunger, and be forced to eat food at a nearly constant rate, or
lapse into the worse sort of behavior.  Documented instances of ghoulish
cannibalism abound, as well as the famous case of Nemlith Caridor, whose was
possessed by his own demon.  Powerless to resist, Nemlith devoured an entire
bowl of poisoned fruit, which he had been in the habit of duping unfortunate
subordinates into eating.

#DESCRIPTION Most void scholars and even some lay folk have heard tale of demonkind. 
The most common image associated with such tales, legends, or firsthand
experience tells of beasts which are so horribly strong or wickedly alien
that even the least of them are formidable.  

What fewer know is that there are a class of demons which are specifically a
mockery of the spirit world.  These creatures seldom have explicit shape, or
form, but they do have much of the intangible nature one normal sees in
spirits.  Unfortunately, demons such as this seldom possess the benevolent
or at least indifferent natures of the free form spirits of mortals. 
Rather, these are filled with a great hatred and malevolence, often directed
at mortals and even other demons who possess material form.  

Doubtless there are many, perhaps even an infinite number of such demonic
spirits in the Void.  However, there are three broad categories of them of
which we in the dark arts are aware.

#DESCRIPTION This collection of geometric figures is an unsettling array of vertices
and lines, each forming a disturbing angle.  Dark runes dot the corners of
the inscription, whose connected lines give it an unsettling impression of
depth.  Appearing to jut out into space, it seems more an artifact of some
alien geometry than a simple two dimensional inscription.  

As you plumb the depths of the image, you find yourself increasingly unable
to look away, until you find yourself somewhere vastly different....  



You travel through a place of unnatural angles, filled with spires and
troughs which quiver due to the force of their own sickly geometry.  

Your path twists and winds, at times looping over and behind itself,
twirling into a helix then following the border of some unimaginable shape. 
No clear direction describes your wandering, but as you travel, you are
struck by the impression that you are being followed.  

In the corners, living angles scuttle in the shadows.  Sharp, ominous
frames, they flicker just out of sight, threatening your progress. 
Overhead, a lean black shape cries out with shrill hatred, and the angles
draw closer.  

Your panicked flight brings you to a local minima in the fabric of this
space, and before you is a host of disturbing shapes.  Each of them appears
to be a polyhedra, warped and twisted into dimensions far beyond the ken of
normal mortals.  They float with intelligence, communicating in dark,
sonorous fugues.  They turn to you, and, shatteringly, you find that you can
almost understand them.  Like mad geometers, they exchange theorems about
the horrors of their space, twisting natural law to their will.  

Listening and witnessing what you have, all faith or confidence in the world
as you know it slips away.  Horrified, you race toward a discontinuity in
the path, and hurl yourself over the edge, hoping to escape.  The sounds of
the alien polytopes follows you into the abyss, and reveals dark secrets all
the way to an infinity of darkness.....  



When your vision clears, you fear for your sanity.  The angles of that place
have been burned into your being, but your confidence in the nature of the
physical world has been shattered.

#DESCRIPTION \"The Knowing of Selb-Kar" is the title of this volume of demonological
lore.  

Unfortunately, as is most often the case, the bulk of the tome is actually
the mad ravings of its author, who consistently refers to himself in the
third person, by the rather regal title of "The Grand Hierophant of
Geometry".  

One particularly lucid passage describes a location in the Void known as
"Selb-Kar".  It is unclear whether Selb-Kar is a city, a geographical
feature, or some sort of unholy temple.  

One fairly lucid passage describes a trip the author made to Selb-Kar, and
things he witnessed there:

"Tall spires of angles more obscene than acute shadowed me.  Vershaks
shrieked catcalls above.  There was no light until I saw the Intersection. 
A host, no, a floating, flickering, SENATE of shape met at the Intersection.
Dark, alien polytopes, led sonorous fugues, speaking things that no thing
ought not, for they were no thing.  They turned, and I looked at them, but
they LOOKED BACK.  They CHANGED me, and now I SEE.  

MY SOUL HAS A SHAPE NOW"

The rest of the book is far less coherent.  Towards the end, the author
promises to reveal the arcane "Angles of Selb-Kar" which can be used to
summon denizens from that place.  True to his word, the last page is
inscribed with a complicated and obscure collection of runes, lines, and
angles, denoting the mystical symbol referred to be studied by the skilled
scholar.

smoky aroma of the large fire burning in a stone fireplace.  Towards the
front of the room, a large rug pattered with blue and yellow designs is
spread on the floor, littered with countless toys and drawing utensils.  A
large oaken desk has been set beside the door, covered with sketches that
clearly are the work of a child's hand.  In the northeast corner of the room
a simple wooden staircase leads up, and an arched doorway is set into the

#DESCRIPTION This cramped, low room is thick with a smoky haze, the dry, warm air
heavy with the acrid smells of the forge.  A large, cluttered workbench
fills one corner entirely, covered with scraps of metal and a jumble of
tools.  In another corner, a round forge made from bricks of shaped clay
glows brightly, the orange-red light pouring through the small, grilled
opening.  A low counter divides the room from north to south, and several
low cushions of rich fabric have been set out for customers to wait upon. 
The low roofbeams of aged wood are charred slightly in a few places, but
otherwise the shop is quite well-kept.  A floor of magically smooth stone is
clean and neat, but for accumulated splashes of spilled metal near the
forge.  A rich tapestry hangs on the east wall, beside a luxurious, gilded
door.  The room is lit by several glowing orbs above the workbench, tempered
with the fiery light of the forge.  

A pricing chart hangs on the wall near the bench.

In the ceiling, three more symbols can be seen.  Each is positioned to sit
between two of the six, should they be placed level with each other.  The
three symbols of ancient power, nature, and transmogrification, combined

#NAME The Apothecary's Cabinet
#DESCRIPTION This low room is painted a serene shade of turquoise, the heavy roofbeams
made from dark, stained wood.  A tall counter of Nendorin oak dominates this
space, restricting access to the back two-thirds of the room.  Set into the
middle of the counter is a pale stone disc, about three feet across, etched
to resemble an eye.  The pupil and outer edge of the eye emit a dim glow.  A
silver plaque hangs at the end of the counter.  Behind the counter, the
walls are lined with wooden racks that stretch from floor to ceiling. 
Within the racks hang endless rows of wands, staves and glass vials of every
imaginable hue.  Tiny motes of energy, spread throughout the racks, cause
the vials to glow brightly and bathe the room in a sea of multi-colored
light.  A narrow archway framed in the eastern wall leads out.  A heavy,
velvet curtain blocks out all light coming from the adjoining room, though a
hint of roasted meat seeps through, blending with the acrid odors that hang
heavily in this room.

dipping inwards dangerously in the middle.  A stair leading to an upper
story has long collapsed, the shaft upwards filled with the caved-in remains
of the stairwell wall and the stairs themselves lying shattered on the floor
in a mass of splinters and rust.  Two large windows to the south have been
boarded up.  The air is musty and stinks of urine and damp.  No furniture is
in the room, having been long carried-off or used as firewood.  A small
threadbare carpet, incongruously clean, sits in the empty northeastern
corner.  A drunken, sagging doorway leads out to the street to the south,
the door itself lying flat on its face on the floor.

#NAME Inside the Northern Gatehouse
#DESCRIPTION This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n'er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.  

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  gatehouse gate gates lever niche mechanism
#DESCRIPTION The gatehouse is a typical one, providing extra fortifications at this
key point along the city walls, and framing the sturdy reinforced gates.  In
a niche to one side of the gatehouse, the mechanism of cogs, weights and
pulleys that operates the gate is housed.  You see there the lever which can
be pulled to open or shut the gates.

#NAME Abandoned House
#DESCRIPTION This house seems to have been lived in rather recently, but the tenants
have since moved on in their existences.  A few, ragged blankets still line
the northern wall, however, judging from the droppings left behind, they got
their most recent use from some sort of rodent.  You can exit the house to
the south by squeezing through some loosely hung boards.

#NAME Sadrent Road
#DESCRIPTION Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the east, Dretch street leads into
the most notorious neighborhoods of Var Bandor.

#NAME A Dilapidated Shanty
#DESCRIPTION Dirt is the most prominent feature of this broken-down home.  Dust is
caked on top of the cabinets, whose doors swing from one hinge.  A table is
scored with cuts from hundreds of knife strokes, and bread crumbs are
scattered about it.  One chair in the corner is missing a leg, and leans
against the wall.  The roof has been patched numerous times, but
strategically located buckets sit in various places on the floor.

window with only one shutter on the eastern wall.  While pieces of it are
everywhere, a large mass of hay is somewhat constrained to a corner of the
room, with a sweat-stained blanket thrown haphazardly on top of it.  Some
cracked crockery has been ground into the floor near the door, although a
few pieces are still whole.

being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  The
citywall is to the west, and the back of a building is east.

Some are being heated over huge furnaces, just turning the yellow-orange
color of heated ore while others are being lifted over molds and tilted to

metal assault your ears as finished casts are being thrust into barrels of
salt water or oil, depending on the finish wanted for the item or if a
worker is putting some finishing touches on a cast with his hammer.  You can

#NAME A Run-down House
#DESCRIPTION This house is still remotely homely: the owner seems to have done
whatever he could to make it inviting, but did not keep it up well.  A hole
is in one wall, letting the eastern light fall directly on the bed.  You
hear the faint squeaking of many rodents, and skittering claws in the walls.
However, a faded landscape of rolling hills is slowly disintegrating with
time, on the western wall.

#DESCRIPTION Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.  To the west, Iron Street leads into
the industrial section of Var Bandor, and to the east, Raddin street winds
through some run-down buildings.

#NAME An Empty House
#DESCRIPTION This house seems to have been lived in rather recently, but the tenants
have since moved on in their existences.  A few, ragged blankets still line
the northern wall, however, judging from the droppings left behind, they got
their most recent use from some sort of rodent.  You can exit the house to
the north by squeezing through some loosely hung boards.

#DESCRIPTION This moderately-sized residence is somewhat unusual for a scholar's
abode, in that everything is put away neatly.  Gone is the usual scattering
of possessions hither and yon.  The floor is neatly swept, and covered with
precisely placed rugs.  The walls are, expectedly, lined with bookshelves,
but each book seems to be categorized and in its place.  A few floating
globes drift about in mid-air, containing living ferns or flowers.

#DESCRIPTION This one-room office is small and hopelessly seedy.  Dirty grey plaster
is cracked and bubbled in many places, stains and discolorations covering
the surface.  The roofbeams sag wearily, and the creaky floor is bowed and
warped.  Equally flimsy chairs are lined against the eastern wall.  The room
smells of damp and mold, and apparently hasn't been cleaned in years.  A
high desk, built to eliminate the need for a stool, sits opposite the
chairs.  An incredibly grimy window is made of dozens of thick, blurry panes
of cheap glass.  The window admits slightly less light than the open doorway
beside it which leads north out of the room.

#NAME An Empty Alleyway
#DESCRIPTION This is more a very small alcove than much of an alleyway, a tiny space
crammed between an old warehouse and a shipping office.  Some piles of junk
lie shoved against the wall, a handy storage space for things people haven't
gotten around to throwing away yet, and trash and an empty mug or two lie
scattered about.  It is very dark, barely any light coming in from the road
or sky, and unseen eyes watch from the shadows at the rear of this niche. 
Aragol Street goes by south of here, most walking by the alleyway without a
glance.

purse missing, if he was fool enough to take it here.  To the south, many
people are crowded by a few tables, the rattle of falling dice heard in
moments of anxious quiet.  North is the door back to Dantaron Road, standing
open in welcome perhaps, though from the look of the rusty hinges, if the
door was moved it would fall right over.

#DESCRIPTION The Journey's End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper's personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

in the main part of The Journey's End.  A single bed is pushed into one
corner, the covers folded back, ready for whenever the innkeeper retires for
the night.  A short table stands next to it, completely bare of any sort of
decoration, and a small bookcase is against the opposite wall, but the

in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

#DESCRIPTION The statue before you is rather monumental in size.  It features a tall,
grinning man holding a dead stag out at his side.  The stag is done in
striking detail, so much so that it appears to have been simply turned to
stone from life.  Its fur is shown matted and clumped as if with blood, and
a few large wounds have been made in its side.  A hunting spear is thrust
through its belly, which is similarly covered with blood, and its head turns
at an unnatural angle, resting against the rocks of the statue's base. 
Tongue hanging limply out of its mouth.  It is held up on its hind legs by
the grinning man to the piece's right.  

The man is displaying a thick-lipped grin as he presents his kill with one
massive hand.  He is dressed in many fine things, including a breastplate
with inlays that appear to be made of diamonds.  His eyes are narrowed
slightly by his cheeks, yet his face gives off an aura of complete pleasure
and self-satisfaction.  A long ponytail of hair trails down the statue's
heavily muscled back, its strands resting between two very detailed
shoulderblades.  He is clearly alatharyan.  

At the bottom of the statue, an engraving has been made.  It reads "Bodisous
Bofarin welcomes you to the Beast and Bandit."  Below this is written, in a
similarly-sized text "By Isal Achia, Mistress of Sculpture."

for the most unusual piece decorating the chamber.  A mirror hangs on the

He obviously knows where to give his loyalty to keep his status.  Commerce

Flickering flames provide a warm light, although most of the flames just
seem to be floating in mid-air by the walls, not attached to any sort of
source.  Many portraits line the walls, and magical feather dusters fly
about the room, making sure no dust mars the beautiful appearance of the
room, and its many magical toys.  A plush red couch sits against one wall,
and a small table sits in front of it.  On the table, an illusion of a
dancer moves inside a small glass globe.  Inset into the north wall, a
doorway leads into what appears to be a laboratory, and Arcanos lies out the
door to the south.

#DESCRIPTION This ancient house is in a ghastly state of disrepair.  Wooden slats are
ripped from the floor, leaving only rotting wood over an earthen bottom. 
Most of the plaster from the walls has long since crumbled to dust, leaving
only the husk of a frame.  The room itself stretches to the west and north,
where you can make out a doorway.

===========================

Sing/Speak from your stomach, not your throat.

Be sure to keep your posture erect or you won't
have as much air in your lungs.

Eye-contact is essential in involving an audience.

A story or song must be started in some interesting
manner, or no one will bother to listen.  Be creative
and original.

How you finish is equally important to how you begin.
Be sure to pace yourself appropriately.

Your instruments are your tools of expression,
they both aid and limit you.  Take good care of them.

#NAME A Tentacled Corridor
#DESCRIPTION This dark, damp corridor is alive with rubbery, clammy tentacles. 
Wriggling, they grow from the walls and ceiling of this place, writhing
toward any trace of heat or life.  The floor is made of some bulbous, fleshy
substance, which seems organic, if not quite as animate as the tentacles. 
To both the east and the west, the corridor opens into larger chambers.

#NAME A Chamber of Flesh
#DESCRIPTION This underground chamber is hewn not from stone or soil, but is rather a
cleft in the bulk of some great mass of flesh.  The walls and floor
palpitate in harmony with some alien, discordant rhythm, and black fluid
pulses through the barely translucent surface of the chamber.  A mound of
gray slime slopes up against the northern parts of the room, ascending to a
rubbery slit in the ceiling.  A door made of pulsing flesh is set into the
east wall.
