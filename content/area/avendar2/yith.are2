#ALIGN -500 0
#DESCRIPTION A hideous being of twisted, veined muscle lurches here, radiating a sense
of power and authority.  Its skin is a sickly, glazed black, and dotted with
faint scarring remnants of sores.  Its entire front bulges outwards with
hairless muscle, scarred with scabbed-over wounds of various size and depth.
Its arms, thick and powerful, extend from his sides, each clutching a
several-headed whip of razor-sharp barbs and thin-wired tips.  Its lower
body descends into two potent-looking limbs of the same black flesh, which
hook backwards in a way similar to that of a goat.  

His head is a most horrific perversion of nature itself.  Thick and bulbous,
it embodies the characteristics of an assortment of animal-forms, and yet
never seems to decide on one for certain.  Instead, the form of the head
twists and writhes upon itself, removing eyes, replacing snouts, and closing
over gills continously as it glares about its surroundings.  Although never
settling upon a single form for more than an instant, one thing is constant;
the taskmaster's visage remains hideous in the extreme.

#DESCRIPTION At first you see nothing but darkness, and feel nothing but a musty chill
air which seems to cling to you skin.  You take a few tentative steps, if
only to shake off the dry, stale air.  The floor is of wide, rounded
cobbles, hard and reassuring beneath your feet.  As you walk, shapes begin
to resolve themselves from the darkness.  Layered horizontal lines form some
sort of corridor, extending as high and as far as you can see.  It soon
becomes clear that these horizontal lines are shelves, and that the corridor
is a passage between bookcases.  The complete darkness of moments ago is
broken now with the faint, red glimmers of candle or lantern light, burning
at points so far distant that their flamelights are dimmed and blurred into
hazy motes.  At long intervals, archways open in the bookshelves,
silhouetted by the ambient glow.  These archways lead to yet more corridors
in what appears to be a library of unthinkable proportions.  

Innumerable volumes clutter the shelves, ordered only so far as their
disparate media and many languages allow.  Heavy, leather-bound tomes jostle
with loose folios of yellowed parchment, and cracked and dessicated scrolls
are gently arrayed alongside graven sheets of charcoal-coloured slate. 
These works are scribed in languages both familiar and wholly alien.  All of
the sentient races of Avendar seem to have contributed wisdom to this
magnificent library, and yet most of the works are unreadable.  Outnumbering
the mortal texts by far are those scribed in the infernal alphabets of the
the denizens of the Void.  Varied as the Void is vast, most scripts seem to
symbolize sounds unutterable by the mortal throat, and in many cases,
thought processes alien to the mortal mind.  From beautiful and convoluted
cursive streams, designed to be read in some non-linear fashion, to insolent
columns of angular hieroglyphs, manifestly the product of some deeply
violent race.  Unbreachable walls of knowledge surround you, and it is with
a spasm of lurching dismay that your own meager quest for knowledge is
placed in perspective.  

This sobering thought weighs upon your mind as you step from between two
bookshelves into a more open, hexagonal area.  The walls of the space are
also formed from bookshelves and archways open in each of its six sides,
leading to yet more corridors of bookshelves in all directions.  Yet it is
to the center of the hexagon that your attention is drawn, where a high
stone lectern holds an open tome.  

You are now standing before the lectern, staring down at the opened page of
the tome.  Intricately scribed on a thick, fibrous parchment is a design of
baffling complexity.  At first it appears to be a set of interlocking
triangles of different shapes and sizes.  It then becomes clear that,
through a mastery of perspective, all of the triangles are perfect
equalaterals of exactly the same size.  Their initial differences come from
varied facings and depths, somehow rendered through alteration of the widths
of their sides and their apparent angles.  As you settle into admiration of
this peculiar work, it occurs to you that there is something deeply wrong
with the arrangement.  Triangles are linked where no joining should be
possible, lines pass over lines where they should pass under, by any sane
geometry, and the entire space represented seems insufficient to hold the
design.  More than an optical illusion, the configuration suggests some
underlying rhyme and logic, as though the addition of extra dimensions would
render the structure intelligible.  

Your head swims as you attempt to wrap your mind around these newly-glimpsed
dimensions; dimensions which require new perspectives on time and knowledge,
presence and absence, as well as a rewriting of your understanding of space.
The confusion becomes vertigo, and the vertigo soon develops into an
overwhelming pain.  Long before you can truly grasp the implications of the
pattern, you black out.  

You awaken standing before the High Priest in Yithoul, your mind still
reeling in the new depths revealed to you, and the Vkoren Configuration
indelibly imprinted in your mind.

#NAME A Vast Library
#DESCRIPTION Innumerable volumes clutter the shelves, ordered only so far as their
disparate media and many languages allow.  Heavy, leather-bound tomes jostle
with loose folios of yellowed parchment, and cracked and dessicated scrolls
are gently arrayed alongside graven sheets of charcoal-coloured slate. 
These works are scribed in languages both familiar and wholly alien.  All of
the sentient races of Avendar seem to have contributed wisdom to this
magnificent library, and yet most of the works are unreadable.  Outnumbering
the mortal texts by far are those scribed in the infernal alphabets of the
the denizens of the Void.  Varied as the Void is vast, most scripts seem to
symbolize sounds unutterable by the mortal throat, and in many cases,
thought processes alien to the mortal mind.  From beautiful and convoluted
cursive streams, designed to be read in some non-linear fashion, to insolent
columns of angular hieroglyphs, manifestly the product of some deeply
violent race.  Unbreachable walls of knowledge surround you, and it is with
a spasm of lurching dismay that your own meager quest for knowledge is
placed in perspective.

#NAME A Hexagonal Chamber in the Library
#DESCRIPTION You step from between two bookshelves into a more open, hexagonal area. 
The walls of the space are also formed from bookshelves and archways open in
each of its six sides, leading to yet more corridors and more bookshelves in
all directions.  Yet it is to the center of the hexagon that your attention
is drawn, where a high stone lectern holds an open tome.  A design of
baffling complexity is scribed on the thick, fibrous parchment of the opened
page.  

#BEGIN_EXTRA_DESCRIPTION
#KEYWORDS  tome
#DESCRIPTION At first the design within this tome appears to be a simple set of
interlocking triangles of different shapes and sizes.  It then becomes clear
that, through a mastery of perspective, all of the triangles are perfect
equalaterals of exactly the same size.  Their initial differences come from
varied facings and depths, somehow rendered through alteration of the widths
of their sides and their apparent angles.  As you settle into admiration of
this peculiar work, it occurs to you that there is something deeply wrong
with the arrangement.  Triangles are linked where no joining should be
possible, lines pass over lines where they should pass under, by any sane
geometry, and the entire space represented seems insufficient to hold the
design.  More than an optical illusion, the configuration suggests some
underlying rhyme and logic, as though the addition of extra dimensions would
render the structure intelligible.  

You think, perhaps, that by studying the symbol, you might come to
understand its mysteries.

#KEYWORDS  symbolvision
#DESCRIPTION Your head swims as you attempt to wrap your mind around these
newly-glimpsed dimensions; dimensions which require new perspectives on time
and knowledge, presence and absence, as well as a rewriting of your
understanding of space.  Just as you begin to make some small sense of these
bizarre configerations, your confusion develops into vertigo, and the
vertigo soon develops into an overwhelming pain.  Long before you can truly
grasp the implications of the pattern, you black out...
