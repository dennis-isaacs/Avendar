a swirling blight spirit~
An obscene construct of miasma and decay swirls erratically here.
~
This hideous atrocity comprised of rotten flesh and decomposing organic
matter swirls in a whirlwind of negative energy.  A bulbous mass of dripping
black ichor holds two hollow sockets resembling eyes that glare wrathfully
at it surroundings.  Many tentacle-like extremities, each ending in hooked
jagged claws, propel it along with surprising speed and ferocity.  Its body
emanates a corrosive aura and leaves a trail of caustic fumes in its wake.

Ingaraxxi Demon Devourer~
Ingaraxxi~
Ingaraxxi the Devourer lumbers along here.
~
Ingaraxxi\@s giant form towers above you, towering almost thirty feet at
the shoulders.  Tree-trunk arms are covered in the pulsing, dark runes of
void magic, extract their toll on his body.  Countless wounds, the result of
thousands of battles with the denizens of the Spirit realm, are unhealed,
blood perpetually seeping from the marks of the blades of light.  His
piecemeal armor is made up of black iron, shaped menacingly in the fires of
the Inferno and forged into sharp, jagged edges.  Inside his
disproportionately massive maw is a collection of sharp, jagged teeth,
yellowed and chipped.  The demon wields a massive scourge which he drags
along the ground with wanton disregard and a stone shield, the size of a
table, strapped to his forearm, leaving his hand free to grapple with.

cloak lava molten fire obj_24812~
a cloak formed of molten lava~
A cloak seemingly formed of molten lava lies here.~
This cloak, crafted in the chaos of the plane of fire, is rumored to have
been intended as a gift from the magmin to the warlords who led the siege in
the War of Fire.  However, as the war was lost, the cloak has since been
passed among the greater magmin as a symbol of power and influence over the
material plane, and is imbued with the magics of fire.  
The phrase \#Aegis of Fire!\# is said to activate some of its powers.

Sunthu long stone-shafted shining crystal spear socketed obj_24777~
the dual-headed crystal spear, \#Sunthu\#~
A long, dual-headed crystalline spear is here, its shaft decorated with an intricate relief.~
Crafted by the skilled hands of the ancient alatharya, this spear, known
as \#Sunthu\#, is made from a mystic crystal thought to once be used as a key
part in the rune-engine.  The gems once adorning its head corresponded to
the six prime magics.  The clarity of the crystal suggests that it could
withstand the rigors of large amounts of energy being passed through it, and
as such its value is undeterminable.  

Though the rune-engine and its blueprints were destroyed in the Sundering,
this may very well be the only artifact linked to the incident left in
existence.

The Earendam Road~
The Earendam Road continues north and south as the Earendam Grasslands
fade into rolling foothills.  The narrow strip of stones curves over the low
hills, a broken or missing stone marring the path here and there.  To the
east, an old faded road leads over a hill, in the direction of the Uthlin
Ocean.  To the north, the Brintor Mountains tower majestically, the
snow-capped peaks rising into the clouds.

Brintor Mountains.  The condition of the narrow strip of stones deteriorates
as the distance from Earendam increases, until the missing stones outnumber
the remaining ones.  To the north, the majestic purple peaks tower, rising
from the foothills in breathtaking grandeur.

majestically, the snow-capped peaks reaching to the heavens.  The evergreens
grow much thicker as the mountains approach, forming into a forest at the
very base of the range.

struggling evergreens and patches of rough grass.  Far to the north you can

The Earendam Road is a narrow strip of stones, many broken or missing
from the passage of time.  The road was once heavily travelled by caravans
and merchants trading with the mountain outposts to the north, but in recent
years the road has fallen into disuse, and is no longer actively maintained.
The Earendam Road leads north and south through the grasslands.
