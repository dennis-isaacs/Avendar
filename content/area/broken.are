Ssesaryk srryn massive dark-scaled dark~
Ssesaryk~
A massive dark-scaled srryn paces irately about the room.
~
This thick-bodied srryn is covered with shiny dark green scales mottled
with dull, black patches.  A series of jagged, scaly protrusions outline his
sinister yellow eyes and progress to the back of his skull.  The jagged
scales meld together to form thick plates down his spine and tail, and have
been crudely sharpened at the tip.  

Ssesaryk, for a long time, had endured the rule of the srryn elders and
disdainfully bent his will to theirs.  Their absence of desire to ravage the
neighboring lands had left a sour taste in his mouth as well as a doubt in
their capabilities.  He took it upon himself to gather together some of the
most brutal warriors and set forth into the Rirro Jagka which seemed to be
feared by his superiors and was considered a cursed land.  Upon conquering
any obstacles he encountered, he desired more than anything, to return
victorious and overthrow the current leaders and take his place in the
history of the srryn.

This large mottled green srryn holds a well balanced posture, his tail
swinging idly behind him.  A tatoo of a saurian tooth adorns his left

Dholoch Jeil~
Dholoch Jeil, leader of the alatharya resistance stands here.
~
Dholoch is a tall alatharya with broad shoulders and bulging muscles. 
His deep silver skin seems to shimmer as he moves.  A wide nose, barely
protruding from his stern face, has a knotted bridge and large nostrils. 
Long gray hair, adorned with a variety of decorations which represent
battles past, is tied tightly at the top of his head and falls haggardly
over his shoulders.  

Dholoch has defended his small village time and time again from invaders and
marauders common to this region.  His many exploits have garnered a position
of respect among his people, and he was given command over the small
defensive force of the village.  He, as well as the village elders, believe
that a unity among the alatharya must be protected and preserved, and he has
dedicated himself to this cause.

This alatharya has been through a terrible ordeal.  With the exception of
a few remnants of tattered clothing he has been stripped completely naked. 
His sickly pale skin is stained with dried blood and his face is bruised and
swollen.  His right arm appears to have been torn off at the elbow and he
cradles the ragged stub with his other hand.  Deep gashes and puncture
wounds riddle his torso as if he had been used for target practice, and a

covering most of his face.  His dark colored eyes peer from under two
inordinately bushy eyebrows.  He is dressed in leather armor that he grew
too large for many years ago, as his rotund gut hangs over his belt.  His
hair and clothes seem quite dirty for a shopkeeper, but his charismatic
smile must be his crowning feature.

with a preternatural glow, and its black nose is keen to the scent of prey. 
Large wide paws allow for a superior ability to balance in the rocky
terrain.

An immense alatharya squats near the fire here.

This enormous alatharya has bulging chest and shoulder muscles that
conceal his neck entirely.  Wavy locks of his windswept, platinum hair lie
lazily over his shoulders and in the center of his broad, square-shaped face
is a tiny crushed nose that seems to almost disappear.  An obscenely lumpy
lower lip which protrudes from his thick beard is split multiple times and
his right eye is slightly bruised and swollen.

A man wearing the garb of an Earendam elite guard is here.

This middle-aged man wears clothes that are dirty and a bit tattered, but
he wears them neatly tucked.  He stands in a rigid posture that has come
from formal training and his pale blue eyes hold a keen vigil on his
surroundings.  Beneath his rags the evidence of a uniform protrudes, and the
emblem of an elite Earendam soldier can be seen marking his shoulder.

a golem of air~
(Charmed) A grey construct of cloudweave has been formed into a humaneseque golem.
~
Woven of fog wisps, precipitation and gentle currents, this hulking golem
swirls with a humanesque form.  Insubstantial grey cloudweave rolls through
its opaque inner core, and occasional thunder from within is muted by its
seemingly solid skin.  A near-constant electric crackle emanates from what
can be best described as its head, and the sound is only interrupted when it
blinks its lightning-jagged eyes.

a homonculus of Chamjask~
Chamjask\@s homonculus is here.
~
This homonculus is a miniature version of:
This tall caladaran appears lost in his own thoughts.  A grimace of
contemplation adorns his aged face, as he pays little attention to his
surroundings.  His stem-like limbs seem frail and brittle, but he moves with
a graceful determination.

a hideous vermin~
A hideous vermin skitters among the shadows.
~
This long-furred rodent has damp, matted hair which appears lumpy from
unseen malignant growths that reside beneath.  Its tiny, needle-like teeth
are yellow and stained and seem to grow at erratic angles from its cankerous
mouth.  It drags a thick, naked tail behind it which seems abnormally
swelled, and trails a constant stream of urine as it slinks along the wall.

An obscene construct of miasma and decay swirls erratically here.

This hideous atrocity comprised of rotten flesh and decomposing organic
matter swirls in a whirlwind of negative energy.  A bulbous mass of dripping
black ichor holds two hollow sockets resembling eyes that glare wrathfully
at it surroundings.  Many tentacle-like extremities, each ending in hooked
jagged claws, propel it along with surprising speed and ferocity.  Its body
emanates a corrosive aura and leaves a trail of caustic fumes in its wake.

a srryn assassin~
A srryn rogue sits quietly by the fire.
~
Dark, shadowed green scales cover this slender srryn.  His yellow,
ophidian eyes are crested with jagged bone protrusions which grow smaller as
they trail down the back of his head.  He offers an occasional sneer to
passersby giving them a glimpse of pale, jagged teeth which gleam with
keenness.

a dull stone ring~
A ring crafted from smooth, dull stone is here.~
In the times approaching the Sundering many of the alatharya began to
scheme great plots to exploit the gods weaknesses.  Ariyehu, a powerful
war-wizard, created numerous artifacts and weapons to combat the powers they
were to inevitably face.  Since the gods were seen as beings of pure magic
and energy, he crafted rings that could draw away their power and weaken
their defenses.  These trinkets are, of course, little more than legendary
among the great scribes, and were surely destroyed during the great undoing.

Sunthu long stone-shafted shining crystal spear socketed obj_24777~
the crystal spear known as \#Sunthu\#~
A long stone-shafted spear with a shining crystal head is here.~
Crafted by the skilled hands of the ancient alatharya, this spear, known
as \#Sunthu\#, is made from a mystic crystal thought to once be used as a key
part in the rune-engine.  The gems once adorning its head corresponded to
the six prime magics.  The clarity of the crystal suggests that it could
withstand the rigors of large amounts of energy being passed through it, and
as such its value is undeterminable.  

Though the rune-engine and its blueprints were destroyed in the Sundering,
this may very well be the only artifact linked to the incident left in
existence.

crystal spear sunthu shining socket socketed~
The long pyramid-shaped crystal at the head of this spear has multiple
sockets molded into its surface.  The shallow sockets appear to have been
formed around specific gemstones which are now absent.  Each side of the
crystal is slightly concave to make acute edges that are razor sharp.  The
crystal is attached to a swivel at the end of the shaft, and the head can
spin easily.  The shaft itself is hollowed stone and fluted to reduce its
weight and improve grip.

plate crystalline armor suit~
The stone plates of this full suit are large and thick, and shimmer with
the presence of crystals contained in the rock.  The joints are tightly knit
leaving little vulnerability.  The waist and extremedies are connected with
small interlocking channels filled with smoothed round crystals making
movement not only easy, but effortless.  Due to its immense size it is
likely that only an alatharya would be able to wear it.

been passed among the hellions as a symbol of great power and influence over
the material plane, and is imbued with the magics of fire.  
The phrase \#Aegis of Fire!\# is said to activate some of its powers.

a black-runed obsidian axe named \@Risr\@~
An axe writ with glowing black runes lies here.~
In srryn legend there was a brutal warrior by the name of Reyth who was
responsible for the destruction of the aelin city of Adyearu near the
beginning of what would become the War of Fire.  His ruthlessness and
unrelenting savagery filled his foes with dread as he would regularly devour
the flesh of his enemies in the belief that he would be strengthened by
their blood.  

His distinction among the tribes, and his reputation as a warrior brought
out the most terrifying determination among the srryn.  They pressed onward
into battle with an unmatched ferocity as they stormed city after city
leaving a wake of ashes.  It is said that Sythrak took great favor upon
Reyth and crafted a weapon for him that would mirror his dark tendencies: an
axe forged from the suffering he had sown and imbued with a portion of his
soul.  In this way Sythrak could enjoy the essence of his carnage for all
eternity.

Nimansday, 29th day of Valectis, 106th season of my being:

My findings on the affects of such potent natural biases over the past
month have perplexed and intrigued me.  I have been utterly engrossed in my
studies as of late, and have all but neglected my customers.  I must find
more specimens of the same caliber to create a yet undefined superiority in
my products.  I feel I must venture to the farthest reaches of the
wildernaess to compile a new, undiscovered series of components for
experimentation.  

Thethelsday, 12th day of Lyceonis, 106th season of my being:

I have packed up my things and taken them with me across the land in search
of a secluded spot to continue my studies.  Venturing into the Arihac
Mountains I was drawn to the peak of Mount Tariyel, as it seemed to have a
strange affect on the vegetation.  I was lucky enough to find a remote
cabin, which had obviously been abandoned for many seasons, and took it upon
myself to settle in.  I have spent much time over the winter fixing up the
cabin and setting up my work station in time to gather new specimens when
spring breaks.  I feel I will learn much from this environment and hopefully
further improve my products.

Evensday, The Day of Tears, 105th season of my being:

I have become uncommonly frustrated recently with my creations.  I have, of
course, been taking the utmost care in my product\@s conception, but I seem
to have hit a wall in their potency.  As a side note, Aelisaia was caught in
the process of rendering down human remains, and such was not looked kindly
upon by the public or by the Guardians.  I have noticed more frequent visits
to my shop, as of late, since I have begun advertising that my products
contain no human ingredients, though not entirely true.  

Lyrenday, 8th day of Kyanamir, 105th season of my being:

I was awestruck today.  This runed pouch given me by Guildmistress Ssid
seems to be of a magical nature.  I found within its contents an odd bit of
twig, which at first I didn\@t give a second thought to, but it had a strange
hue to it as well as a warmth unlike any wood I have previously encountered.
Upon doing several tests on it, I discovered it had unique properties of
nature and the planes.  Its effects on my concoctions were astounding,
raising their level of effectiveness and potency dramatically.  I will
experiment more on this, and perhaps successfully surpass my rival,
Aelisaia.  

Thelansday, 31st day of Kyanamir, 105th season of my being:

I have been finding it more and more difficult to avoid being stereotyped in
my profession.  Since Aelisaia\@s misfortune there have been many unexpected
visitors to my shop.  I have had to explain, in more depth than desired, the
origins of the ingredients I keep in storage to both Guardians and Champions
of Avendar.  As well, I have been hearing whispers of ill-conceived
speculation about where and how I use my powers, not to mention I have been
scolded and warned to be very cautious who I sell my products to.  I feel I
will withdraw for a time and avoid such troubles and perhaps only cater to
some of my more reliable customers.

Thethelsday, 18th day of The Setting, 105th season of my being:

My time within the Circle of the Erudite Eye has come to a close.  I have
trained and studied endlessly for the past season, and have finally attained
the highest rank in the guild.  I am anxious to utilize my newly refined
skills as an alchemist to the public, and I have been granted parting gifts
of various quality ingredients by some of the guildmasters.  Of particular
note, Guildmistress Ssid entrusted to me a runed leather pouch which she
said has brought her great success in her experiments.  I do hope I can one
day impress her with my creations, and perhaps return the favor.  

Endenday, 23rd day of The Setting, 105th season of my being:

On the advise of Guildmistress Ssid, I have travelled to Var Bandor to
market my skills as an alchemist.  The desire for a new variety of useful
products here is staggering.  Many other alchemists have flooded the market
district making it difficult to be noticed, but hopefully my attention to
quality will gain a decent customer base.  

Evensday, 26th day of The Setting, 105th season of my being:

Outrageous!  The same aelin who outdid me in the Dragon\@s Feast competition
has set up shop right next to me!  She offers many of the same products as
myself, and purposely has reduced the price on many of them.  How am I to
compete when I barely make any profit on my goods as it is?  I cannot let
her defeat me so easily, I must stay focused and produce only the highest
quality products so I may become known amongst the other traders.  I will
not produce a multitude of sub-par mixtures; mine will instead be the finest
in creation.

Thelansday, The Dragon\@s Feast, 104th season of my being:

Alas, I have failed to produce an acceptable product for the Patrician\@s
pork feast.  An aelin student, by the name of Aelisaia, has gained the grand
reward for her efforts.  I don\@t wish to say that her concoction was not
worthy of the reward, but it seemed to me that it was more pleasing to the
eye than to the palate.  

Lyrenday, 8th day of Rystaiamir, 104th season of my being:

I have found that, as I have grown more skilled and adept in my art, many
recipes that I had began to take for granted have produced variant results
now that I have a steady hand during their making.  This has forced me to
change many of the components in some of the concoctions I had felt were
simple, to adjust for my improved meticulosity.  However, I have been
pleased with the superior quality, of my potions especially, as they rarely
have any defects or unwanted effects.

Thethelsday, 28th day of Nelennamir, 103rd season of my being:

I feel I have grown apart from my kin, for they retain the traditions of the
old ways.  On this day I have made up my mind to seek out others who possess
a curiosity matching my own.  Though I have been warned by the elders to
avoid the din of the great cities, I am drawn to the knowledge inherent in
what is known as the Circle of the Erudite Eye.  I shall depart on my
venture at dawn, for I have already gathered the belongings I feel I shall
need from this place.  

Nimansday, 2nd day of Tyrilis, 103rd season of my being: 

Today I have met with Eninia Ssid, a guildmaster of the Erudite Eye.  She
has granted me the opportunity to study under her guidance, and has kindly
offered her assistance in navigating the city should I need it.  I am
excited for this opportunity to learn the intricacies of alchemy.  

Iolenday, 32nd day of The Burning, 104th season of my being:

What a day this has been!  Many of the students here are participating in a
friendly contest: to create the most appealing flavor for tomorrow\@s great
feast.  It would seem my knowledge of natural herbs and spices will be quite
beneficial, as Guildmistress Ssid has commended my efforts with great
enthusiasm.  The winner\@s recipe is to be presented to the esteemed members
of the Patrician\@s court, and I feel my chances are quite good!

book8~
This incarnation of fiery wrath would be named Vrakyryl, from a srryn
dialect long extinct it loosely translates into the common tongue as
demonfire.  The creature battled with the water mages in an arduous
confrontation which eventually resolved when Vrakyryl was imprisoned in a
watery tomb beneath the earth.  A rune stone was placed to keep the magical
barrier intact and the danger quelled.  

In the end, the Aelin-Human forces left the valley, the Srryn so weakened by
their own folly as not to constitute a credible threat.  The remaining Srryn
were driven into hiding by the native tribes, who sought revenge for the
blighting of their land.  To this day the crater of Rhag\@azu is avoided for
the burning shapes that still fly over its smoking crater.  
~
E
book7~
If the Srryn had hoped for protection from their own actions, they did
not receive it.  A portal to the Plane of Fire was opened, according to the
stories of the Srryn, and Rhag\@azu not only erupted, but exploded.  The
Elders were slain instantly, and fire rained down on the Broken Lands.  The
Aelin-Human army was forced to pull back, but at terrible cost to the Srryn.
The Mountain collapsed in on itself leaving only a blackened crater in its
place.  

When the eruption had subsided, the Srryn crawled from their holes and the
armies of water marched forth again to find a new horror.  Drakes of fire
had laid waste to the surviving srryn, and Republic records tell of a great
fiery bird that consumed Srryn and Aelin alike in a searing holocaust.  
~
E
book6~
During the waning days of the War of Fire the scholars of the flame
turned to increasingly more dangerous magics.  These attempts to channel
greater amounts of fire usually ended in the spectacular destruction of the
scholar and his surroundings.  Such events are credited by bards for
leveling mountains and deforesting plains.  

The Srryn, in their way, were no different from the scholars.  Faced with
the overwhelming odds, the Elders turned to the flame and their gods. 
Trusting their fate to their own unpredictable magic and the succor of
Sythrak and Bayyal, they roused the volcano.  
~
E
book5~
The Srryn elders gathered atop the great Rhag\@azu, to awake the sleeping
mountain.  They thought to open a portal to the Plane of Fire within its
crater, believing that doing so would rouse Bayyal to erupt the volcano and
direct its fiery wrath upon the forces of the waves.  

The Srryn who passed down this tale spoke of High Shaman Ytha Si\@Tult(iii)
and his fervor.  Despite what would come to pass, it seems the name is still
respected for his faith.  Those \@faithless\@ Srryn who betrayed the cause for
their own gain have their names preserved only as curses.  (iv) 

(iii) Translation Note: Ytha Si\@tult translates roughly from Srryn to \#Soul
Furnace\#.  Whether this was an actual name or merely an idiomatic reference
to the faith of the Srryn elder is unclear.  

(iv) Many tribes of Srryn appear to adopt surnames they respect as opposed
to inheriting them along familial lines.  The names of revered saurians crop
up again and again within historical records of the Republic and the oral
traditions of the Srryn.  
~
E
book4~
The Srryn faced a losing battle, however.  Though both sides were harried
by raids from the local barbaric tribes, the Srryn had other problems as
well.  Republic watchers and rangers were succeeding to track down many of
their mountain redoubts and they were betrayed from within by mercenary
Srryn seeking mercy or to learn the magics of the waves.  Further, their
human generals were dead, having been slain by the magics of water or
devoured by furious saurians who had lost patience with their follies. 
Leadership fell to the fire shamans.  In their desperation these elders
devised a risky plan to secure victory over the Aelin-Human armies.  
~
E
book3~
In the waning days of the War of Fire, the saurian armies had been
sundered and routed in the west.  Var Bandor and Earendam were liberated,
and the Srryn were pushed back south into the swamps and east into the
Broken Lands.  In the western reaches of the Rirro Jagka(ii) the remains of
the Srryn forces took shelter in the volcanic, rifted region to regroup
while the forces of Light pressed their advantage.

What followed, according to Republic records was several months of
skirmishes between the remains of the Srryn and the larger, more organized
Aelin-Human army.  Srryn fire templars, aided by saurian rangers and the
treacherous terrain staged a series of hit-and-run assaults while the
water-armies sought to pin down the Srryn to force a final confrontation.

(ii) Translation Note: Rirro Jagka translates into \#Broken Land\# in the
ancient tongue and the two terms are used interchangably.
~
E
book2~
In an effort to illuminate the murky histories of the Broken Lands I have
traveled its length and breadth, collecting the oral traditions of its races
and peoples.  I have lived with the many tribes as one of their own, in
turn.  I have spent countless hours in the libraries of Earendam poring over
the reports and histories compiled by historians and generals both.  In this
volume, I discuss the history of the volcanic Mount Rhag\@azu(i) and its role
in the War of Fire.

(i) Translation Note: Rhag\@azu translates from the Alatharyan tongue to
\#Doom Fire\# in the common.  It is unclear if it was so named before its
eruption in the War of Fire.

prevents most plant life, but cracks and crags in the rock face allow

indentations from tumbling stones and debris that left their mark as they

and blocks out the sky, and the scent of ash and sulfur is carried on the

thin layer of straw lines the rock floor, cushioning footsteps, and adding a

channels that are chiseled into the stone.  A wide pit in front of the
structure is filled with various hewn body parts and bones, and several tall
spires have been erected around its perimeter with bloody heads and skulls
impaled upon them.  A small, black stone chamber has been built to the east
with a heavy stone door facing the platform.

A Crude Stone Hut~
This hut appears to be haphazardly constructed with no symmetry or logic.
The few support columns, erratically spaced about the hut, are chipped and
cracked from abuse.  The stone walls have massive gashes in them
compromising the integrity of the structure.  Debris from the straw roof
litters the floor, some of which has been mashed into a corner as a
makeshift bed.  The roof still provides some cover, but weather has severely
eroded portions of the floor.

The rocky path circles a small pool surrounded by glossy, black rocks.  A

earth near the wellspring to take advantage of the necessary liquid.  Tall,
jagged rocks border each of the three paths leading away from the communal
crossroads, and to the south, a large structure has been built into the side
of the mountain.

A Rippled Black Plain~
A thin crust of rippled, black rock coats the surface of a vast molten
lake.  Thin wisps of smoke rise from brilliant orange cracks that expand and
contract as heat escapes from below.  Stone plates flex and curl as they
slowly liquify and disappear.  Lines of deep blue flames dance along the
edges of fissures as if celebrating among a harmony of whines, pops, and
sizzles that fill the smoky air.

The Mouth of a Lava Tube~
A gaping tunnel, at least three alatharya tall, climbs its way up the
southern face of Mount Rhag\@azu.  The volcano towers above you, its summit
emitting a bright orange glow through its dense, caustic blanket of smoke. 
A thin flow of slow moving lava drools down the center of the tube and forms
a mass of congealed rock at the base of the opening, making it easy to climb
inside.

Inside a Lava Tube~
This wide tube was created by lava flowing down the southern face of the
volcano in vast quantities.  Now only a thin stream of lava slowly trickles
down the center of the tunnel, and the glassy, black stone reflects the dim,
orange light.  The high ceiling is decorated with tiny stalactites that
shimmer with mineral deposits, and a continuous breeze of heated air seems
to rush up the tube.

An Ascending Path~
This narrow trail winds between high cliffs which line either side and
hold the path in their shadow.  The sloping ground is carpeted with loose
rocks which make travelling on foot difficult.  Several sharpened poles have

The End of a Wide Rocky Ledge~
Here atop a jagged spire of blackened rock the vast Uthlin Ocean
stretches out endlessly to the northeast.  The scent of caustic smoke wafts
through the air stinging your senses.  Below, to the north, a steady stream
of lava flows down the volcano and meets the sea within a thick cloud of
steam.  The crater releases plumes of black smoke and orange embers which
swirl around the peak above.

A Path Along a Jagged Cliff~
Large, broad boulders form a winding stair that hugs a jagged cliff.  The
edges of the rocks are sheer and sharp, having been tumbled down the spiked
terrain, and many of the odd spires along the slope constantly release fumes
in thin wisps.  The earth has been stained by smoldering ash and has dried
to a dark gray.  A continuous current drifts upwards as the crater above
draws air to stoke its furnace, and bits of ash and sand are carried in
waves that course up the mountain.

A Wide Rocky Ledge~
The wide conical bases of the inky black spires of rock which protrude
from the mountainside create an angled, but passable surface.  The air carries
large flakes of ash on the sea breeze which streams in from the north, and a
small path leads down the jagged cliff along the western face of the
volcano.  The crater showers the slopes above with cinders and stones,
and casts a foul black cloud which seems to swallow the air around it.

A Ledge Within the Crater of Mount Rhag\@azu~
A portion of the crater wall has fallen inward forming a ledge suspended
several feet above the lava.  The tall western wall arches towards the
center of the crater and the top edge hangs precariously overhead.  The
eastern crater wall has collapsed and lava flows slowly over the brim down
the mountainside.  Thick pyroclastic clouds churn in the air above and
around the crater, and the caustic odor of sulfurous vapors permeate your
senses.  

Strange glyphs are charred onto the stone platform surrounding a wide,
shallow pit.  Burnt remnants of various debris fill the bottom of the
receptacle and odd depictions of pyrotechnics line its edges.

A Rocky Arroyo~
This arroyo winds westward through the rocky terrain.  The shallow walls
seem uncommonly smooth compared to the other formations around, and the
ground is covered with a layer of compacted silt.  Several small piles of
dirt have been scraped up from the ground along the edges of the wall likely
from resident wildlife.

A Rocky Arroyo~
This arroyo comes to an abrupt end here; the rock wall leaving no remnant
of past water flow except for a moderate crevice at the base of the western
wall.  The shallow walls seem uncommonly smooth compared to the other
formations around, and the ground is covered with a layer of compacted silt.
Several small piles of dirt have been scraped up from the ground along the

The Beginning of the Tariyel Trail~
A near vertical trail winds its way up the side of Mount Tariyel leading
towards the summit.  Of all the mountains in this range, Tariyel is one of
the few to have a peak lush with vegetation.  The verdant greenery
surrounding the pinnacle of the mountain gleams like a beacon over the
desolate terrain.  Even here, among lifeless rock, the prominent scent of
pine wafts through the air.

The Anyare Badlands~
This vast volcanic plain of pitted black stone was created from numerous
lava flows spilling off the mountain range.  The uneven surface glistens
with a glassy luster, and retains the channels and canals of the molten

A Ledge Along a Sheer Cliff~
A wide ledge travels along this tall cliff like a long, natural shelf. 
Clearly visible in the rock are colored stripes of earth that rest one on
top of another, the layers representing centuries of the lands creation. 
From this height you can look down upon a vast, volcanic plain whose glossy
luster sparkles like a calm, black sea.  The lengthy grasses of the Earendam
Grasslands bristle against the edge of the ridge above you and make a
rasping sound as the crisp blades caress the stone.

lava flows spilling off the mountain range.  The uneven surface glistens
with a glassy luster, and retains the channels and canals of the molten
rivers that once flowed here.  Small pools of water have formed in the
indentations of the impermeable rock, and reflect mirrored images of the
broad sky above.

A Ledge Along a Sheer Cliff~
A wide ledge travels along this tall cliff like a long, natural shelf. 
Clearly visible in the rock are colored stripes of earth that rest one on
top of another, the layers representing centuries of the lands creation. 
From this height you can look down upon a vast, volcanic plain whose glossy
luster sparkles like a calm, black sea.  The lengthy grasses of the Earendam
Grasslands bristle against the edge of the ridge above you and make a
rasping sound as the crisp blades caress the stone.

gather, cling to the cracks in the earth.  The cool green pinnacle of Mount
Tariyel casts its shade down the steep slopes and fills the air with a piney
fragrance.

The End of the Tariyel Trail~
Small markings on the rocks indicate the end of the Tariyel Trail which
travels up and over the high peak of Mount Tariyel.  The harsh terrain has
minimal vegetation growing between the volcanic rocks except for a few
tenacious shrubs.  A rocky valley lies below while a near vertical trail
winds up the eastern face of the mountain.

snugly among the underbrush.  Several wooden planks, now cracked and rotted,
have been embedded into the ground before the door to create a makeshift
walkway.  Dilapidated stone edging appears to have bordered a small garden
bed on either side of the path, but they have become overgrown and tangled
by the surrounding forest.

A Remote Cabin~
This weathered log cabin has been constructed from sturdy native trees. 
A fine amber pitch has been used to seal up the gaps in the wood and gives
off a pungent pine fragrance.  Resting atop a hearth of smooth, black stones
at the base of the north wall is a small wood stove that comfortably warms
the room.  In the western wall, a wide picture window showcases an expansive
view of the mountainside and the surrounding valleys.  A smooth pine
bookshelf has been built into the southern wall, and a polished pine desk
sits in the northeast corner.  On the floor below the window, the outline of
a small trap door can be seen with its handle resting flush with the wood.

The window looks out over the sparsely forested slope of Mount Tariyel. 
A variety of plants and trees are dotted among the rocks until the incline
reaches the barren valley below.  The peaks and valleys of the Arihac
Mountains stretch off into the distance with streaks of cloud encircling the
tallest summits.  A hue of red and blue gleam off the bare rock of the cliff
faces revealing evidence of their geological makeup.

The pine wood floor has been smoothed to perfection, and a patchwork of

from the vast, golden grasslands.  A seemingly permanent fog conceals the
majority of the Swamps of Sythtys away to the southwest.  The dark brown
terrain of the mountainside forms tall spires, which reach towards the
heavens, lining all the valleys.

The Peak of Mount Tariyel~
A single immense pine tree grows atop the peak of Mount Tariyel.  Its
lush branches form a thick green canopy over the pinnacle of this majestic
mountain.  The tree has grown to the width of several alatharya and reaches
high into the clouds disappearing from sight.  An astounding view, surveying
the entire mountain range, is unmatched in its natural beauty.

view range beauty astounding~
Gazing out from beneath a thick cover of soft pine needles you take in a
great breadth of view.  The cliffs around you are sheer walls of jagged
rocks with layered colors and streaks of red, blue, and silvery grey
glinting in the light.  The near vertical drop slowly levels out far below
and blends effortlessly into the valley before climbing again into the
heavens on a different summit.  Far to the north a faint glow from Mount
Rhagazu offers a reddish backlight to the skyline and mars the sky with its
inky plumes.  

The rise and fall of the peaks and valleys stretch across the landscape in
most directions save where the earth seems to yield to the ocean.  Choppy,
white-capped seas, which shimmer even in the faintest of light, continually
lap hungrily against the rocky protrusions living in the shallows.  The
winding shoreline has become shrouded in a steely mist that seamlessly
blends the boundaries of earth and water as each appears to flow into the
other.

The cool, dry air of this room carries the scent of burnt chemicals. 
Numerous boxes and shelves are filled with glass vials, flasks, and other
alchemical paraphernalia.  A series of intertwining tubes, set up on a
workbench along the eastern wall, pump a variety of colored fluids into
several large flasks.  A disorderly array of note papers and scrolls filled
with confusing mathematical expressions lie in piles on almost every flat
surface in the room.  Rickety wooden stairs lead to a trap door on the

The Base of Mount Rhag\@azu~
The ground here is split and fractured forming a web of narrow fissures
that stretch across the steep mountainside.  Noxious smoke and vapors
continuously pour from the crevices and stain the air with a sickly,
greenish hue.  The knee-deep smog carpets the shoreline and partially
conceals the treacherous footing.  The fuming crater far above continuously
coughs black, incendiary clouds into the air which cascade down the
precipitous, charred slope.  Ashes and minute debris float by on the heat
currents and seem to dance and twirl in the air as they pass.

A Beach of Black Rock~
Thin wisps of steam hazily waft across super-heated rock like gaseous
serpents.  The glassy, black slope becomes precipitous as it reaches towards
the fuming crater high above, and a thick, caustic cloud roils from the
summit which blocks out the sky.  Some of the ripples in the slope exude a
dull, red glow which hiss and whine as the waves overtake them.  Clusters of
cracked, crumbling stones lie partially submerged in the shallows and have
collected a carpeting of marine vegetation and barnacles.

A Rocky Shore~
Long, black, icicle-shaped formations stretch from the end of a high lava
tube down the reddish-brown wall of the cliff.  An oddly-shaped pile of
lumpy black rock looks like it has been vomited onto the stony shore and
smoothed out by the waves.  Gravel and small pieces of glassy, black rocks
have formed a thin shoreline at the base of the tall cliffs.  The surf
repeatedly crashes against the rocky shore creating a thin, white mist that
fills the air.

The End of a Lava Tube~
The tube ends abruptly at a gaping hole in the side of the mountain.  The
glossy, black walls and ceiling have crumbled away leaving only treacherous,
jagged edges.  Long, black, icicle-shaped formations stretch from the base
of the tube down to the bottom of the sheer cliff.  The cliff wall all
around the tube has been scorched and coated with black residue.

Inside a Lava Tube~
This section of the tube has been formed into a large spherical chamber. 
Thin, swirling ledges of glossy, black residue line the walls evidently
caused by churning lava.  It appears the massive flow met some kind of
natural barrier here that delayed its progress and forced it in a new
direction.  The rippled walls are covered with crystallized minerals which
sparkle in the dim light.

Inside a Lava Tube~
This wide tube was created by lava flowing down the southern face of the
volcano in vast quantities.  The glossy, black walls are made of smooth,
brittle stone indicative to rapidly formed igneous rock.  The tunnel is
nearly vertical with barely any stable footing.  Thin beams of light from
the chamber above are refracted by the crystallized mineral deposits left in
the walls.

A Fork in a Lava Tube~
This wide tube was created by lava flowing down the southern face of the
volcano in vast quantities.  Now only a thin stream of lava slowly trickles
from under a pile of crumbled rocks.  The high ceiling has a large hole
where the tube collapsed, and is decorated with tiny stalactites that
shimmer with mineral deposits.  The wider of the two tunnels slopes gently
to the south and appears to have been formed first.  The other seems to have
bored straight down into the mountain to its own end, likely draining out
the first tube.  The glassy, black walls reflect the dim light and
illuminate the tunnel junction.
