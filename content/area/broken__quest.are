imp sage black leathery minordemon minoroneshot~
an imp sage~
A black-winged imp sage floats here.
~
This small, black imp has the leathery wings and scaly body that typify
most of its kind, but a number of things seem askew about the demon.  Most
noticeably, it wears a pair of miniature wire-rimmed spectacles, and rather
than being supported by the action of its wings, it floats due to the
influence of some magical spell.

The N\@jith is an aberration that could only fall under the dominion of Kyalee.
Finding that a whole hand is a might too much to swallow, the N\@jith will often settle for a finger.
A sprinkling of bone might suffice for the walls of the Orzub\@s prison.
The orzub is a hungry one, but I do think his favorite food is the entrails of scholars.
The Aklaju often employ orzub in situations where the body need not be disposed of neatly.
Diplomats often employ Djazith, but keeping them in tongues can be quite a bother.
The bloated ones are drawn to mud smeared in just the right way -- I think they may have simple tastes.
The spiny Qwablith\@s power lies within the constellation of the Logorin star.
I would say that the gharku had the heart of a bear, if the blood of an animal did not bind it.
The gharku swears fealty to the Aklaju, but I truly wonder if they know the source of their hieroglyph\@s power.
Like many of demonkind, the gharku loves the taste of cold iron.
The Kakrisc worm is one of Pricina\@s more amusing pets.
Control the Kakrisc worm with your own blood, applied liberally to the ground.
Give the Kakrisc a fresh head to feed on, and it will serve you well... for a time.
The hungry spirit knows no end to its desire, but it balks at the blood of the Firstborn.
Take care that the right entrails are strewn about before you conjure the devouring spirit. 
Nothing but the spirit of famine awaits you in the Maze.
The j\@nakra is rarely seen, but is easily bound by black yarrow.
A suitably interesting invisible trinket might be of interest to the j\@nakra.
The mysteries of Pnakur\@s lost cipher might help to unravel the secrets of the j\@nakra.

A green Vakalic imp screeches through the air here.

Colored a pale, septic green, the Vakalic imp is typical specimen of its
breed.  Its body is roughly humanoid in form, but is roughly the size of a
small cat.  It is covered in damp, slimy scales, and supported by an
unusually strong pair of leathery wings.  For arms, it has miniature claws,
and its face has a typically demonic cast, complete with snapping
needle-sharp teeth.

A filchling flutters silently through the air.
~
This rubbery, grey demon is a filchling, one of the many breeds of
Vakalic imps.  Thin and spindly, it has extremely flexible, elongated
fingers, each with at least six digits.  Its feet are webbed, to allow for
quiet footfalls, and its tiny, whisper-thin wings that allow it to flutter
through the air with great stealth.

A clawed Orzub stands here, ready to pounce.

Vaguely humanoid in its shape, the Orzub leans forward aggressively upon
its powerful, crouched legs.  Sleek, grey skin is drawn tightly about sinewy
muscles, allowing one to see the heavings of the demon\@s protruding rib
cage.  On either side, long, stick-like arms extend outwards, each one
ending in a razor-sharp, bony sickle that seems to have ripped its way out
from its fleshy cage.  Extending forward from the demon\@s face is a gaping,
canine jaw, lined with a double-layer of smashed, jagged incisors.  Bounding
forward with each step, the Orzub\@s claws seem to whistle through the air
with ominous speed.

a gelatinous Kurlaac~
A gelatinous Kurlaac slithers through here.
~
The Kurlaac possesses precious little in the way of actual structure,
being mainly a blob of sickly grey goo, with a few hard balls of some
hardened milky substance scattered about its interior.  The only thing
marking it with intelligence at all is a humanoid face, which grows on one
side of the gelatinous mass.  The face gurgles and drools, snarling
invectives at nothing in particular.

A heavy black gharku pounds along.

A powerfully built demon, the gharku stands enshrined in dense, spined
plates of midnight black chitin.  Thick, plated arms - replete with bony
serrations - hang by the gharku\@s side, ending in massive, black pincers,
capable of snapping a man in half.  The gharku\@s hulking weight rests upon
short, squat legs, each one bent ever so slightly at the joint.  The legs
extend onward into bony, clawed feet.  

A seemingly human skull, wrapped tightly in grey, decaying skin, rests atop
a stick of a neck, protruding only slightly forward from its hulking torso. 
Its jaw is set into a permanent grin, jagged and broken teeth, thrusting
forth from shriveled lips.  Bloodshot eyestalks erupt from the gharku\@s
empty sockets, endlessly swinging about in search of prey.

j\@nakra ethereal minordemon minorbound demon imp imp-like form~
an ethereal j\@nakra~
An imp-like form seems to shimmer in and out of existence before you.
~
The thing before you is vaguely reminicent of an imp, albeit one larger
than its brethren.  The flesh of the j\@nakra is a sickly white hue, its
paleness implaceably unwholesome.  The limbs of the beast end in sets of
piercing and rending claws while its pinched, impish face sports a grinning
mouth of jagged bone spurs.  A pair of rapidly flapping wings support the
creature, the membranes of its bat-like members a strikingly unreflective
black.  Discerning these features is made all the more difficult by the
j\@nakra\@s only semi-visible nature.  

The j\@nakra never is fully visible, pieces of its body always seeming to
fade into the air.  Even as the limbs shimmer back into existance, others
fade creating an unsettling picture of semi-intagibility.  The beating of
its wings and the tittering of its deadly mouth suddenly cease on occasion
as the sources of the sound disappear, the ensuing quiet soon shattered as
its flesh continues its dance through the ether.

No price is needed to feel the sting of the khudh\@itzu fly. 
Gorged on animal blood, a symbol made from it might contain entire swarms of khudh\@itzu flies. 
Eyes mirror the soul, so the Chaigian dopplegangers collect the eyes of potent beings avidly. 
You can always hear the khudh\@itzu in Xixyzr.
Vershak are very fonds of the skulls they collect.
The winged vershak is quite possibly the most normal of the denizens of Selb-Kar

The Nvae\@gra often serve as inquisitors in Logor, heating their chains to sear the flesh of their victims.
Burnt wood can contain the dreadful Khil\@Mestahn. 
In Xixyzr, the Khil\@Mestahn swarm like locusts through the darkness. 
Chitin is not enough for the Khil\@Mestahn -- it demands potent armor of mortal forging.
Sharper than the atthagth\@s sting is the star of Logor.  
Isetaton\@s minions might be yours, for only a thimble of salt. 
Isetaton\@s minions are most assuredly summoned by Isetaton\@s sign.
Servitors of Isetaton have many tentacles, but no hands. 
There is a horror in Logor that comes with twilight, and is only sated by feeding on the blood of large animals -- quite a delicacy in the void. 
Undead brick, undead bone, both bind the horror of Logor.
Even a demon queen has servants, and Pricina claims the succubi. 
The succubi always take their price from your own heart. 
The blood of the most holy of beings might be the only drink a succubi would refuse.

a hound of Abuha~
A large, wolf-like beast, jet-black and hairless, stalks along.
~
In form like a great, hairless wolf, the hound of Abuha stands fully
three feet at the shoulder, its muscular legs and back offset by its
emaciated, almost skeletal, rib cage, face and protruding spine.  The
beast\@s skin is black, and its eyes deep-set burning coals, as though the
conflagration which consumed its flesh now dwindled in those flickering
orbs.  Its long muzzle is thick with serrated teeth, which gleam white
against its snarling, jet-black jowls.

attack by latching on with their serrated claws, and then piercing the flesh
with their sharp probisci, which drain blood to fill the translucent bulb on
the fly\@s tail.  There are several dozen flies in this particular swarm.

a Khil\@Mestahn~
An armor plated behemoth, a Khil\@Mestahn looms here.
~
A smaller cousin of the foul Khil\@ayum race, the Khil\@Mestahn stands a
mere twelve feet in height.  Thick plates of sickly green chitin cover the
beast, its armored hide fiercely spiked.  A pair of long, plated arms extend
from its body, each ending in a set of claws more reminicent of swords than
fingers.  An impossibly wide maw hangs slightly ajar, displaying rows of
razor teeth, below a set of black, doll-like eyes.  

The Khil-Mestahn plods along slowly, heavily.  The creatures breaths are
audible-sounding as a huge bellows, each exhalation accompanied by a
dripping of viscous saliva.  The doll-like eyes flicker, and then are calm
once more.

the spawn of Atthagth~
A demonic scorpion scuttles about, covered with black chitin.
~
A massive monstrosity of midnight chitin, the spawn of Atthagth resembles
some form of twisted scorpion.  A mad chittering emanates from the mass of
pitch plating as the demon scuttles about, the noise clawing at the corners
of your mind.  It carries itself on six legs, each many jointed limb covered
with the same barbed and serrated chitin.  A pair of massive pincers snap
idly, each easily as long as an ethron is tall.  Looking over the thing, you
note a curious lack of eyes.  What truly catches your eye, however, is the
tail.  

Atop a tail rising five feet, a wicked looking stinger is perched.  The
cruelly barbed point drips a vile crimson ichor as it twitches left and
right, seeking flesh.  The volume of the chittering seems to rise and fall
with the stingers movements.

A combination of features both horrific and beautiful, this initiate of
Pricina hovers before you on spined, batlike wings.  The succubus hovers
unclothed, her soft curves readily visible.  Visible too are her unnaturally
long fingers and toes, the digits elongating into piercing claws.  The flesh
of her hands and feet are black as pitch, a stark contrast to the skin of
milky white covering the rest of her body.  Where white flesh meets black,
the colors spatter into one another as they blend.  The skin of her face is
pulled tight over her skull, the gaunt appearance contrasting the pleasant
softness the rest of her body seems to have.  Her eyes also strike you as
unnatural, the pupils vertical slits, like a cats.  The eyes flash hungrily
as they dart, searching.

worm giant ghal\@koth black greaterdemon greateroneshot~
a giant ghal\@koth worm~
A giant ghal\@koth worm slithers about in a puddle of its own excretions.
~
The true length of this great worm is nearly impossible to tell, as the
countless windings of its body are too convoluted to gauge readily.  The
worm is divided into cylindrical segments, each formed by a sharp,
cartilaginous substance, which pulse and shudder in harmony with the
twisting of the beast.  Yellowish oil oozes from pores on the worm, and
collects in a viscous puddle beneath it.  

Its maw is wide enough to devour a horse, and is filled with row after row
of grinding, jagged teeth.  An eerie green phosphorescence grows on the
inside of its gullet, the byproduct of the worm\@s last meal.

Agduk Hunt Lord Scion greaterdemon greateroneshot~
Agduk~
Agduk, the Scion of Xthjich, gazes imperiously about the room.
~
Agduk is the Demonic Lord of the Hunt, birthed of Xthjich and the Succubi
Queen Pricina.  His form is roughly humanoid, but in the place of flesh, he
sports a spiked black exoskeleton, serving as an armored carapace.  Sharp,
finely honed blades of bone jut out from beneath his hands, each a dangerous
sword-like reaver.  The demon\@s face is a livid grey, and is stretched
tightly across his alien skull.  

His eyes are quick and alert, and have pupils slit like some great cat.  He
prowls as he moves, and occasionally darts toward his destination with an
alarming speed, completely unencumbered by his bulky armor.  Unlike most
demons, there is no foul smell associated with Agduk -- only an unnerving
olfactory stillness.

Barkja, also known as the Infernal Sage, is a tall, lanky demon, replete
with greenish skin and almost human proportions.  Clad in exotic, purple
silks, Barkja peers curiously at his surroundings, meticulously examining
every detail of his surroundings.  

Small pouches and reagant sacks cover his stick-like frame, along with an
exceedingly sinister collection of dissection knives.  Renowned even about
demonkind for his knowledge, Barkja was said to have advised even the great
Xthjich before his defeat at the hands of the Titans.

The bitter thorns of a simple plant have a pernicious affect on the Ghal\@koth.
Agduk\@s power is best accessed through his father\@s sign. 
The Hunter collects swords of unusual make or power.
Agduk loves nothing more than the slaughter of pure beings, and might be drawn by a suitable quantity of their blood.
True to its nature, the Gamalean sapling will flourish in ground sown with salt. 
Logor has a new Grand Vizier -- Vaeshir, the Demilich.
The Grand Vizier of Logor can be summoned, but expect a mighty price.
Pricina herself can be summoned with the greatest of rituals. 
Pricina loves to collect the hearts of her greatest lovers, often mortal adventurers of some repute.
The warriors of Chaigidon are legendary even in the Void.
What blood but the most powerful of the mightiest of mortal races could bind the warriors of Chaigidon?
The denizens of Chaigidon will only work for the finest of weapons. 
Khamurn himself does not respond to normal conjurations, but perhaps one of his syndics would.
Rare metals will do to bind the syndics of Khamurn. 
The denizens of Khamurn recognize one price -- a fee measured in gold.
Nyogthua often makes a pet of various unclean spirits.
What better to contain the unclean spirit than the blood of a powerful ch\@taren?
Unclean spirits love nothing better to nest inside the skulls of powerful adventurers.
Isetaton itself can assume the illusion of flesh if you know the Maze.
Isetaton\@s likeness requires the brainstuff of a powerful creature to be properly bound. 
Isetaton\@s coming was one of the gifts of Uzith-Hazhi.
Only the most delicious of entrails will satiate the Chez\@lnith.

gamalean sapling tree malignant greaterdemon greateroneshot~
the Gamalean Sapling~
A malignant tree with moist, fleshy bark protrudes from the ground here.
~
The black and riven offshoot of some ghastly tree protrudes from the
ground here, forming a tapering, scabrous stem which rises some thirty feet
into the air.  The bark of the malignant plant has both the color and
texture of charred flesh - a tortured network of ebon ridges which writhe
atop a tender, pink interior.  The gnarled skin is studded here and there
with ruddy, weeping ulcers, in each of which gathers a putrid-smelling,
crimson sediment.  Several large lumps can also be seen beneath this carnal
membrane, slowly inching their way upward.  Closer inspection reveals these
to be detritus from a variety of corpses - a skull here, a pelvic bone
there, and even an entire humanoid form enveloped in one gluttonous bulge,
part of its dead face leering blankly from a rent in bark.  

The tree itself bears several branches, which extend from the main bole at
irregular intervals.  These naked limbs, slender as willow-wands, rise from
the tree and then hang downwards at their tips, appearing for all the world
like the fleshy rods of some diabolic angler.  And the gruesome catch of
dead things, now shorn of skin and muscle, passes along these limbs to hang,
then drop, like ripe fruit, to the ground below, forming a wide annulus of
carrion about the tree\@s base.  

At the very apex of the demon tree hangs a bulbous nodule; a small, sickly
fruit, its translucent skin a deep, asphyxiated purple.

Vaeshir the demilich, Grand Vizier of Logor, floats here.
~
The demilich Vaeshir floats here, its form an ebony skull wreathed in an
ethereal blue flame.  One of the most powerful forms of undead, the demilich
before you contains is all that remains of the physical form of the archmage
Vaeshir, tied through mystic bonds to his dreadful spirit.  Unthinkably
powerful and intelligent, the demilich emanates and aura of fear and dread,
cloaking itself in black magic.  Its skull is free from any sign of decay or
age, and it almost seem to grin, its teeth replaced with flawless fire
opals.  

Vaeshir is the Grand Vizier of Logor, and rules that demon city from its
Iron Throne.  Once a powerful archmage, Vaeshir became a demilich, and
subverted the dark prophecy of the then Grand Vizier Chagrob to his own
ends.  Promising the demon lord that a demilich would sit once more on the
Iron Throne in a year\@s time, Vaeshir returned with power and took the
throne for himself.

a Logorin taskmaster~
A mass of black-fleshed muscle, a Logorian taskmaster glares sternly.
~
A hideous being of twisted, veined muscle lurches here, radiating a sense
of power and authority.  Its skin is a sickly, glazed black, and dotted with
faint scarring remnants of sores.  Its entire front bulges outwards with
hairless muscle, scarred with scabbed-over wounds of various size and depth.
Its arms, thick and powerful, extend from his sides, each clutching a
several-headed whip of razor-sharp barbs and thin-wired tips.  Its lower
body descends into two potent-looking limbs of the same black flesh, which
hook backwards in a way similar to that of a goat.  

His head is a most horrific perversion of nature itself.  Thick and bulbous,
it embodies the characteristics of an assortment of animal-forms, and yet
never seems to decide on one for certain.  Instead, the form of the head
twists and writhes upon itself, removing eyes, replacing snouts, and closing
over gills continously as it glares about its surroundings.  Although never
settling upon a single form for more than an instant, one thing is constant;
the taskmaster\@s visage remains hideous in the extreme.

Standing over eight feet tall, this insectoid syndic of the demon
magistrate Khamurn is well suited to its normal duties in the defense and
organization of Khamurn\@s court.  The demon has a sticklike, insectoid body,
complete with four independent arms.  Covering its body is a hard green
exoskeleton, and prehensile pincer-like hands are located at the end of each
of its lanky arms.  

Along with its blood-red compound eyes, the syndic has an impressive bundle
of antennas sprouting from the two nodes on its head.  The creature is
largely free of superfluous motion, except the constant twitching of the
antennae in response to otherworldly stimuli.  It wears no formal armor, but
is draped in fine purple silks of its office.  Each of its arms bears either
a sword or a shield, which it holds at ready.

A wispy black cloud drifts about, a pair of shining blue eyes within.

The wispy darkness before you seems to twist of its own accord, heedless

through the mist with feral rage, searching.

Isetaton~
The slithering avatar of the demon sultan Isetaton floats languidly here.
~
Isetaton is known to have many names and countless obscene shapes, but no
form of the Demon Sultan is more well known than his essence as the
slithering avatar.  On first glance, his form appears to be roughly humanoid
-- but closer examination yields a being in large part, if not wholely,
alien to this plane of existence.  Small worm-like tentacles dot his body,
grey worms covered with sucker-like protuberances.  Breaking the integrity
of his flesh, jaws both large and small clatter noisily as Isetaton floats
about the room.  Thin eyestalks which sprout from around his neck scan all
directions about the demon, while the eyes set in the center of his face are
little more than blackened orbs.

a handmaiden of Tzakmeqiel~
A handmaiden of Tzakmeqiel the Desecrator burbles to herself.
~
This handmaiden of Tzakmeqiel is mostly a lump of bloated flesh.  She
moves by propelling her lower, blob-like body along a trail of slick mucus,
while the vestigates of a head and torso are supported by the mounds of fat.
A nauseating reek bubbles up from her depths, following the pulsing and
roiling of distended tissue.  

More horribly, the handmaiden\@s skin is obviously diseased, and, in some
cases, putrefying.  Boils crisscross her face and neck, while plague sores
are omnipresent.  Oozing, never healing wounds open and close in time with
her burbling motion, and the handmaiden\@s eyes are a jaundiced yellow.  The
demon speaks rarely, pausing to wretch up the contents of her stomach
between belching forth curses and insults at nothing in particular.

dance about the edges of this alien polytope, their lines jagged and degrees

A grotesque, bulbous C\@thsa spawnling thrashes about.

A bulbous, grublike worm, this C\@thsa spawnling is several feet long. 
Banded in chitinous armor, the demon is featureless but for a snarling,
dripping mouth filled with jagged, cruel teeth.  The armored plates clatter
together horribly, grinding and screeching.  A wet trail seems to follow the
worm about.

A mangled, chitinous fragment of a C\@thsa worm writhes in agony, bleeding ichor.
~
A lesser entity of the dark world Yra, this fragment of an enormous worm
flails about in agony, severed at one end and bleeding ichor profusely from
many gaping wounds.  Many of the dense, armored scales are rent and
shattered, soft, pale unflesh quivering beneath.  A many-toothed maw gapes
in one end, slack and soft.  A sickening, rotten air follows the demon
about, and mucus drips with a soft hissing.

A cloud of sickly yellow fog floats here.
~
A cloud of thick, foggy mist floats here, its color a shade of sickly
yellow.  You can catch faint flickers of motion within the cloud, prompting
closer examination.  

As you peer into the cloud, you see odd translucent things moving within the
suffocating mist.  Small, ghostly jaws dance within the cloud, snapping
hungrily and silently as they wink in and out of existance.  The eddies and
currents within the fog seem to carry the phantom mouths about in a
haphazard fashion as they desperately seek flesh to rend and consume.

Carved from pure grey marble and marked with mystical runes, this vault
is an enormous room, easily large enough to hold a stone giant, or even a
dragon.  Supported by enormous tons of stone, the Vault appears designed to
survive a very large amount of punishment.  The once-pristine marble is
scorched a pure ash-black, coated with a thick layer of grimy cinders. 
Long, rent cracks in the stone issue wisps of smoke from time to time, and
each rune glows with renewed spiritlight.  The floor is oddly smooth and
unhurt, the glassy surface now polished to a mirror finish.  To the north, 
a charred archway leads out onto the open, ruined dome.

An enormous black cloud hangs in the air here, shrouding the presence of some abominable creature.
~
A horrendous black cloud hangs here, shrouding the visage of some
abominable creature.  This thing inside the cloud ..  Is not.  Scarcely
organic, the demon is more animate geometry than any being shaped from flesh
and bone.  The monstrosity flexes and pulsates as it rotates through the
surface layers of the cloud.  Flickering, disconnected joints dance about
the edges of this alien polytope, their lines jagged and degrees obscene. 
The pattern made by the the thing would be mesmerizing, save for the brutal
fact that to look into this being is to look into madness.

Akraelyn Champion emeritus trainer train ctrainer gladiator~
Akraelyn~
Akraelyn, Son of Jolinn, stands ready to train his fellow Champions.
~
A man of middling height, Akraelyn stands resolutely before you.  Broad
across the shoulders, with well defined muscles, his thick arms are crossed
with faded scars.  His dark, weather-worn skin is covered loosely by a
coarse, short-sleeved tunic.  Thick bands of iron are wrapped about his
forearms, each one engraved with the sign of the Sapphire Spear.  Quiet in
appearance, he carries himself like a hunted beast, his wary eyes ever
searching over the surrounding area.  

Closely cut locks of unkempt, greying hair frame his hardened face.  The
shadow cast by the tired strands falls over a noble brow, which looms
majestically over his clear green eyes.  Thick, grizzly stubble lines his
resolute jaw, giving him a rough and disheveled appearance.  Once-full
cheeks have grown thin, enunciating the authoritative aspect of his chin.  

Now retired from his legendary career, Akraelyn is still renowned for his
legendary exploits.  A man who began life in the slave pits of Ashta Harrud,
he escaped to walk the lands of Avendar as a Champion and follower of
Jolinn.  In time, he came to be leader of his Order, and guided the Tower of
Aramril through the turbulent years marking the rise of the Coven of the
Shunned.  From facing the dread Tzet-Sabanthe to his travails in the realm
of dreams, he proved his mettle time and again as battle leader.  Now, he
has returned from wandering Avendar as leader emeritus, and trains young
Champions, putting them through their paces here in the tower garden.

A blind human stands here imperiously, tattooed head to foot.

This short human is tattooed from head to foot in a spreading, curling
network of whorls and spirals.  The severe designs make his skin seem a
charcoal grey, and his eyes have been cruelly gouged out.  The scars are
cauterized into deep depressions, combining with his dusky skin to give him
a decidedly shuddeni-esque appearance.

mpforce ham_reynaldo say My lord, I did intend it.
mpforce ham_polonius say Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
mpforce ham_polonius say Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
mpforce ham_polonius say And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
mpforce ham_polonius say What company, at what expense; and finding
mpforce ham_polonius say By this encompassment and drift of question
mpforce ham_polonius say That they do know my son, come you more nearer
mpforce ham_polonius say Than your particular demands will touch it:

mpforce ham_polonius say As may dishonour him; take heed of that;

mpforce ham_polonius say As are companions noted and most known

mpforce ham_polonius say Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
mpforce ham_polonius say Drabbing: you may go so far.
mpforce ham_reynaldo say My lord, that would dishonour him.
mpforce ham_polonius say \@Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
mpforce ham_polonius say You must not put another scandal on him,
mpforce ham_polonius say That he is open to incontinency;
mpforce ham_polonius say That\@s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly

mpforce ham_polonius say The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
2
mpforce ham_polonius say A savageness in unreclaimed blood,

mpforce ham_reynaldo say But, my good lord,--
mpforce ham_polonius say Wherefore should you do this?
2
mpforce ham_reynaldo say Ay, my lord,
mpforce ham_reynaldo say I would know that.
mpforce ham_polonius say Marry, sir, here\@s my drift;
mpforce ham_polonius say And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
mpforce ham_polonius say You laying these slight sullies on my son,
mpforce ham_polonius say As \@twere a thing a little soil\@d i\@ the working, Mark you,
mpforce ham_polonius say Your party in converse, him you would sound,
mpforce ham_polonius say Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
mpforce ham_polonius say The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
mpforce ham_polonius say He closes with you in this consequence;
mpforce ham_polonius say \@Good sir,\@ or so, or \@friend,\@ or \@gentleman,\@
2
mpforce ham_polonius say According to the phrase or the addition
mpforce ham_polonius say Of man and country.
mpforce ham_reynaldo say Very good, my lord.
mpforce ham_polonius say And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
mpforce ham_polonius say about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
mpforce ham_polonius say something: where did I leave?
mpforce ham_reynaldo say At \@closes in the consequence,\@ at \@friend or so,\@
mpforce ham_reynaldo say and \@gentleman.\@
mpforce ham_polonius say At \@closes in the consequence,\@ ay, marry;

mpforce ham_polonius say Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
mpforce ham_polonius say There was a\@ gaming; there o\@ertook in\@s rouse;
mpforce ham_polonius say There falling out at tennis:\@ or perchance,

mpforce ham_ophelia say My lord, I do not know;
mpforce ham_ophelia say But truly, I do fear it.
mpforce ham_polonius say What said he?
mpforce ham_ophelia say He took me by the wrist and held me hard;

mpforce ham_ophelia say And, with his other hand thus o\@er his brow,
mpforce ham_ophelia say He falls to such perusal of my face
mpforce ham_ophelia say As he would draw it. Long stay\@d he so;
mpforce ham_ophelia say At last, a little shaking of mine arm
mpforce ham_ophelia say And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
2
mpforce ham_ophelia say He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
mpforce ham_ophelia say As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
mpforce ham_ophelia say And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
mpforce ham_ophelia say And, with his head over his shoulder turn\@d,
mpforce ham_ophelia say He seem\@d to find his way without his eyes;
mpforce ham_ophelia say For out o\@ doors he went without their helps,
mpforce ham_ophelia say And, to the last, bended their light on me.

mpforce ham_polonius say This is the very ecstasy of love,

mpforce ham_polonius say As oft as any passion under heaven
mpforce ham_polonius say That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
mpforce ham_polonius say What, have you given him any hard words of late?
mpforce ham_ophelia say No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
2
mpforce ham_ophelia say I did repel his fetters and denied
mpforce ham_ophelia say His access to me.
mpforce ham_polonius say That hath made him mad.
mpforce ham_polonius say I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
mpforce ham_polonius say I had not quoted him: I fear\@d he did but trifle,

mpforce ham_ghost say Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
mpforce ham_ghost say But this eternal blazon must not be

mpforce ham_ghost say If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
mpforce ham_hamlet say O God!
mpforce ham_ghost say Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Murder!
mpforce ham_ghost say Murder most foul, as in the best it is;

mpforce ham_hamlet say Haste me to know\@t, that I, with wings as swift

mpforce ham_ghost say And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
mpforce ham_ghost say That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
mpforce ham_ghost say Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
mpforce ham_ghost say \@Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
mpforce ham_ghost say A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
mpforce ham_ghost say Is by a forged process of my death
mpforce ham_ghost say Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
2
mpforce ham_ghost say The serpent that did sting thy father\@s life
mpforce ham_ghost say Now wears his crown.
mpforce ham_hamlet say O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
mpforce ham_ghost say Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
mpforce ham_ghost say With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
mpforce ham_ghost say O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
mpforce ham_ghost say So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
mpforce ham_ghost say The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
mpforce ham_ghost say O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
mpforce ham_ghost say From me, whose love was of that dignity
mpforce ham_ghost say That it went hand in hand even with the vow
mpforce ham_ghost say I made to her in marriage, and to decline
2
mpforce ham_ghost say Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
mpforce ham_ghost say To those of mine!
mpforce ham_ghost say But virtue, as it never will be moved,
mpforce ham_ghost say Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
mpforce ham_ghost say So lust, though to a radiant angel link\@d,
mpforce ham_ghost say Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
mpforce ham_ghost say And prey on garbage.
mpforce ham_ghost say But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
mpforce ham_ghost say Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
mpforce ham_ghost say My custom always of the afternoon,
mpforce ham_ghost say Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
mpforce ham_ghost say With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
mpforce ham_ghost say And in the porches of my ears did pour
mpforce ham_ghost say The leperous distilment; whose effect
mpforce ham_ghost say Holds such an enmity with blood of man
mpforce ham_ghost say That swift as quicksilver it courses through
mpforce ham_ghost say The natural gates and alleys of the body,
mpforce ham_ghost say And with a sudden vigour doth posset
mpforce ham_ghost say And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
mpforce ham_ghost say The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
mpforce ham_ghost say And a most instant tetter bark\@d about,
mpforce ham_ghost say Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
mpforce ham_ghost say All my smooth body.
mpforce ham_ghost say Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother\@s hand
mpforce ham_ghost say Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch\@d:
mpforce ham_ghost say Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
mpforce ham_ghost say Unhousel\@d, disappointed, unanel\@d,
mpforce ham_ghost say No reckoning made, but sent to my account
mpforce ham_ghost say With all my imperfections on my head:
mpforce ham_ghost say O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
mpforce ham_ghost say If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
2
mpforce ham_ghost say Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
mpforce ham_ghost say A couch for luxury and damned incest.
mpforce ham_ghost say But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
mpforce ham_ghost say Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
mpforce ham_ghost say Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
mpforce ham_ghost say And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
mpforce ham_ghost say To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!

mpforce ham_hamlet say And to the manner born, it is a custom
mpforce ham_hamlet say More honour\@d in the breach than the observance.
2
mpforce ham_hamlet say This heavy-headed revel east and west

mpforce ham_ophelia say No more but so?
mpforce ham_laertes say Think it no more;
mpforce ham_laertes say For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
mpforce ham_laertes say In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
mpforce ham_laertes say The inward service of the mind and soul
mpforce ham_laertes say Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,

mpforce ham_laertes say For he himself is subject to his birth:
mpforce ham_laertes say He may not, as unvalued persons do,
mpforce ham_laertes say Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
mpforce ham_laertes say The safety and health of this whole state;
2
mpforce ham_laertes say And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
mpforce ham_laertes say Unto the voice and yielding of that body
mpforce ham_laertes say Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
2
mpforce ham_laertes say It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
mpforce ham_laertes say As he in his particular act and place
mpforce ham_laertes say May give his saying deed; which is no further
mpforce ham_laertes say Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
mpforce ham_laertes say Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
mpforce ham_laertes say If with too credent ear you list his songs,
mpforce ham_laertes say Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open

mpforce ham_laertes say Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
mpforce ham_laertes say And keep you in the rear of your affection,
mpforce ham_laertes say Out of the shot and danger of desire.
mpforce ham_laertes say The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
mpforce ham_laertes say If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
mpforce ham_laertes say Virtue itself \@scapes not calumnious strokes:
mpforce ham_laertes say The canker galls the infants of the spring,

mpforce ham_marcellus say My good lord--
mpforce ham_hamlet say I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
mpforce ham_hamlet say But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
mpforce ham_horatio say A truant disposition, good my lord.
mpforce ham_hamlet say I would not hear your enemy say so,
mpforce ham_hamlet say Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,

mpforce ham_hamlet say Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
mpforce ham_hamlet say My father!--methinks I see my father.
mpforce ham_horatio say Where, my lord?
mpforce ham_hamlet say In my mind\@s eye, Horatio.
mpforce ham_horatio say I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
mpforce ham_hamlet say He was a man, take him for all in all,
mpforce ham_hamlet say I shall not look upon his like again.
mpforce ham_horatio say My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Saw? who?
mpforce ham_horatio say My lord, the king your father.
mpforce ham_hamlet say The king my father!
mpforce ham_horatio say Season your admiration for awhile
mpforce ham_horatio say With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
mpforce ham_horatio say Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
mpforce ham_horatio say This marvel to you.
mpforce ham_hamlet say For God\@s love, let me hear.
mpforce ham_horatio say Two nights together had these gentlemen,
mpforce ham_horatio say Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
mpforce ham_horatio say In the dead vast and middle of the night,
mpforce ham_horatio say Been thus encounter\@d. A figure like your father,
mpforce ham_horatio say Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
mpforce ham_horatio say Appears before them, and with solemn march
mpforce ham_horatio say Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk\@d
mpforce ham_horatio say By their oppress\@d and fear-surprised eyes,
mpforce ham_horatio say Within his truncheon\@s length; whilst they, distilled
mpforce ham_horatio say Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
mpforce ham_horatio say Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
mpforce ham_horatio say In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
mpforce ham_horatio say And I with them the third night kept the watch;
mpforce ham_horatio say Where, as they had deliver\@d, both in time,
mpforce ham_horatio say Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
mpforce ham_horatio say The apparition comes: I knew your father;
mpforce ham_horatio say These hands are not more like.
mpforce ham_hamlet say But where was this?
mpforce ham_marcellus say My lord, upon the platform where we watch\@d.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Did you not speak to it?
mpforce ham_horatio say My lord, I did;
mpforce ham_horatio say But answer made it none: yet once methought
mpforce ham_horatio say It lifted up its head and did address
mpforce ham_horatio say Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
mpforce ham_horatio say But even then the morning cock crew loud,
mpforce ham_horatio say And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
mpforce ham_horatio say And vanish\@d from our sight.
mpforce ham_hamlet say \@Tis very strange.
mpforce ham_horatio say As I do live, my honour\@d lord, \@tis true;
2
mpforce ham_horatio say And we did think it writ down in our duty
mpforce ham_horatio say To let you know of it.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Hold you the watch to-night?
2
mpforce ham_marcellus say We do, my lord.
mpforce ham_bernardo say We do, my lord.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Arm\@d, say you?

mpforce ham_marcellus say Arm\@d, my lord.
mpforce ham_bernardo say Arm\@d, my lord.
mpforce ham_hamlet say From top to toe?
2
mpforce ham_marcellus say My lord, from head to foot.
mpforce ham_bernardo say My lord, from head to foot.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Then saw you not his face?
mpforce ham_horatio say O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
mpforce ham_hamlet say What, look\@d he frowningly?
mpforce ham_horatio say A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Pale or red?
mpforce ham_horatio say Nay, very pale.
mpforce ham_hamlet say And fix\@d his eyes upon you?
mpforce ham_horatio say Most constantly.
mpforce ham_hamlet say I would I had been there.
mpforce ham_horatio say It would have much amazed you.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Very like, very like. Stay\@d it long?
mpforce ham_horatio say While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
2
mpforce ham_marcellus say Longer, longer.
mpforce ham_bernardo say Longer, longer.
mpforce ham_horatio say Not when I saw\@t.
mpforce ham_hamlet say His beard was grizzled--no?
mpforce ham_horatio say It was, as I have seen it in his life,
mpforce ham_horatio say A sable silver\@d.
mpforce ham_hamlet say I will watch to-night;
mpforce ham_hamlet say Perchance \@twill walk again.
mpforce ham_horatio say I warrant it will.
mpforce ham_hamlet say If it assume my noble father\@s person,
mpforce ham_hamlet say I\@ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
mpforce ham_hamlet say And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
mpforce ham_hamlet say If you have hitherto conceal\@d this sight,
mpforce ham_hamlet say Let it be tenable in your silence still;
mpforce ham_hamlet say And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
mpforce ham_hamlet say Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
mpforce ham_hamlet say I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
mpforce ham_hamlet say Upon the platform, \@twixt eleven and twelve,
mpforce ham_hamlet say I\@ll visit you.

2
mpforce ham_horatio say Such was the very armour he had on
mpforce ham_horatio say When he the ambitious Norway combated;
2
mpforce ham_horatio say So frown\@d he once, when, in an angry parle,
mpforce ham_horatio say He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
mpforce ham_horatio say \@Tis strange.

mpforce ham_marcellus say With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
mpforce ham_horatio say In what particular thought to work I know not;
mpforce ham_horatio say But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
mpforce ham_horatio say This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
mpforce ham_marcellus say Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
2
mpforce ham_marcellus say Why this same strict and most observant watch
mpforce ham_marcellus say So nightly toils the subject of the land,
mpforce ham_marcellus say And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
mpforce ham_marcellus say And foreign mart for implements of war;
mpforce ham_marcellus say Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
mpforce ham_marcellus say Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
mpforce ham_marcellus say What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
mpforce ham_marcellus say Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
mpforce ham_marcellus say Who is\@t that can inform me?
mpforce ham_horatio say That can I;
mpforce ham_horatio say At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
mpforce ham_horatio say Whose image even but now appear\@d to us,
mpforce ham_horatio say Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
mpforce ham_horatio say Thereto prick\@d on by a most emulate pride,
mpforce ham_horatio say Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
mpforce ham_horatio say For so this side of our known world esteem\@d him--
mpforce ham_horatio say Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal\@d compact,
mpforce ham_horatio say Well ratified by law and heraldry,
2
mpforce ham_horatio say Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
mpforce ham_horatio say Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
mpforce ham_horatio say Against the which, a moiety competent
mpforce ham_horatio say Was gaged by our king; which had return\@d
mpforce ham_horatio say To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
mpforce ham_horatio say Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
mpforce ham_horatio say And carriage of the article design\@d,
mpforce ham_horatio say His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
mpforce ham_horatio say Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
2
mpforce ham_horatio say Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
mpforce ham_horatio say Shark\@d up a list of lawless resolutes,
mpforce ham_horatio say For food and diet, to some enterprise
mpforce ham_horatio say That hath a stomach in\@t; which is no other--
mpforce ham_horatio say As it doth well appear unto our state--
2
mpforce ham_horatio say But to recover of us, by strong hand
mpforce ham_horatio say And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
mpforce ham_horatio say So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
mpforce ham_horatio say Is the main motive of our preparations,
2
mpforce ham_horatio say The source of this our watch and the chief head
mpforce ham_horatio say Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
mpforce ham_bernardo say I think it be no other but e\@en so:
mpforce ham_bernardo say Well may it sort that this portentous figure
mpforce ham_bernardo say Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
mpforce ham_bernardo say That was and is the question of these wars.
mpforce ham_horatio say A mote it is to trouble the mind\@s eye.
mpforce ham_horatio say In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
mpforce ham_horatio say A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
2
mpforce ham_horatio say The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
mpforce ham_horatio say Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
mpforce ham_horatio say As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
mpforce ham_horatio say Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
2
mpforce ham_horatio say Upon whose influence Neptune\@s empire stands
mpforce ham_horatio say Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
mpforce ham_horatio say And even the like precurse of fierce events,

mpforce ham_horatio say As harbingers preceding still the fates
mpforce ham_horatio say And prologue to the omen coming on,
2

mpforce ham_bernardo say It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
mpforce ham_horatio say And then it started like a guilty thing

mpforce ham_horatio say Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,

Vakalis is one of the lesser domains of the void.  It is a place of dark,
blasted ground, riddled with warrens and shallow tunnels.  The ruins of some
city, often called by the name of the place, squats in a central hollow.  

Almost exclusively, Vakalis is populated by imps.  Little enough is there to
draw larger classes of demons, so the imps, traditionally at the bottom of
the infernal pecking order, infested the place, and spend their time
bickering over obscure matters of hierarchy.  

The imps common in a diverse array of types, being specialized to various
functions.  They are most commonly in the service of greater demonic powers,
but, as we shall see, can be quite useful when conjured by mortal scholars,
typically called by lesser rituals of power.  
~
E
chapter2~
The most basic, or common (the distinction seems superfluous) sort of imp
is called by the name of the region.  The Vakalic imp is typically green,
with small, functioning wings, and sharp claws.  

Often used as messengers by demonic overlords, the Vakalic imp can be
favorably employed by mortal scholars as well.  Due to their connection to
the void, such imps can travel great distances in a short span of time, and
can be cajoled into transporting items or messages by skilled mages.  

True to their names, the Vakalic imps are conjured through the use of the
Vakalic sign, inscribed in charcoal.  They are quite fond of mortal
clothing, and will often perform their task for a simple set of shoes. 
(There is no accounting for the vanities of imps!)  
~
E
chapter3~
Another commonly occurring species of imp is the so-called filchling. 
Reviled even among imps, they often occupy the bottom of what passes for
social structure among the imps.  This is primarily a result of their
skulking, sneaking nature, and their absolutely obsession with hoarding any
valuables they can in their jealously guarded warrens.  

Their main function is as scouts of spies for competing for whichever other
imp or other powerful demon who can buy their favor.  We of mortal flesh can
bind the demons to do what is perhaps their true calling -- theft.  

Filchlings are summoned under the aegis of the Vakalic sign, and bound by
powdered silver.  True to their natures, they typically demand jewelry to
satisfy their never-ending lust for precious metals.  
~
E
chapter4~
Rarer among imps are those of their number who have learned a smattering
of matters arcane.  They are typically more intelligent than their brother
imps, which either leads them to these additional powers, or have developed
wit as a result of this magic.  Because of both these traits, they are
almost always powerful within imp society, with many subservient imps
reporting to them.  

These imp sages also occur outside of Vakalis, and often in the service at
the courts of various demon lords.  We mortals can take advantage of these
imp sages when we summon them, often obtaining valuable information about
exotic items or personages.  

Unlike most of their brethren, imp sages are not bound by the Vakalic sign. 
Fancying themselves more intelligent and powerful than normal imps, they
have become ensnared by the powers of the Aklaju Hieroglyph, engraved with
lines of black charcoal.  Mercenary in nature, they will often demand a
price in gold coins.

You gaze upon Vakalis, demesnes of the imps.  Countless of their number
move in pulsing and throbbing hordes through warrens which lead to a
decaying city on the surface.  

Of all shapes and sizes, the imps chatter at each other, the combination of
their voices combining in mad harmony.  Imps are called away by larger
demons to serve, and establish a rigid pecking order which is more than
apparent in their constant and often violent behavior towards each other.  

No exit seems to lead from Vakalis, but burned in the lifeless ground near
the place is a symbolic, which can only be the fabled Vakalic sign.  Imps
cluster about it, worshipping it.  

Inexorably, the view within the cube draws you to the Sign, and it expands
to fill the entire image.  Transfixed, you are unable to look away as it
burns itself into your mind, warping your very soul by its presence.

The Theory and Practice of the Summoning and Binding of Demons

                       Ateghu, Dedicant of the Void


        As most learned are aware, void magic, unlike no other, commands
and draws its power from the sentient denizens of that plane. While the
individual scholar can accomplish impressive feats through the use of
channeling negative energy, the most potent of invocations require that
the scholar of void be capable of summoning and binding demons to his
will. 
        This fact, more than no other, has lead to the unfortunate bias the
practice of void magic has experienced in the past. Skilled practitioners
will realize that just because on has traffic with the denizens of the lower
regions does not imply that one necessarily will become their unwitting
pawn. Of course, this risk, along with the risk of death at the hands of
that which we summon is a real one, and it is the purpose of this work
to introduce journeyman in our craft into the safe and efficacious methods
of controlling such entities. 

        Before the formal training begins, let me give a Warning:
Demons, like all the denizens of the planes of Order, are creatures bound
by Laws. Our control of them is a direct reflection of our capability to
understand and implement our understanding, however imperfect,
of these Laws. Departing from the way of careful, disciplined studies
into the realm of chaotic, random experimentations is to be avoided
at all costs, for in that path lies the way to our own undoing.
~
E
chapter2~
The first requirement of any demonic conjuration is of primary
importance. The scholar must first determine the diabolical sign which
holds dominance over the demon that is to be summoned. 

        It is one of the great mysteries of our craft why certain demons
are attracted to, and inevitably, bound by, particular symbols. Certainly,
the symbols which bind a particular demon have some connection to both
the origins and the mystical allegiance of the demon. For instance, it will
often happen that a denizen of the demon city of Logor will be drawn by
sigils and runes native to that place. 

        The theory of this author is that the Symbols are abstract
representations of the true forms and names of demonic life and locales.
The principle of sympathy applies to these forms, and thusly, demonic
life is drawn to and contained by the symbols.

        Unfortunately, the ability to inscribe such symbols is not
a matter of simply memorizing the right angles, distances, curvatures,
and so forth. The scholar must be first find the \#prime form\# of the symbol,
and then through study and experience burn the memory of it into the very
fabric of its being. The \#prime form\# of a symbol is not simply a particular
instance -- rather, they are typically the result of unique mystical contact
between our world and the void. For instance, the death of a powerful
demon, or the completion of a truly terrible curse, might leave behind
such a symbol as a residue. That such pure, or prime forms must be
seen and experienced before the void scholar can faithfully replicate them
is only more evidence that they exist on a more abstract plane of
existence.
~
E
chapter3~
Once the scholar has decided on the symbol he is to use, he then
decides on what material with which to inscribe it. The choice of material
tends toward alchemical in flavor, though typically our knowledge of the
proper ones is jealously guarded, being won through dark divination,
long study with infernal sages, or at last resort apprentices used in
carefully controlled experiments.

        Typical fluids or crushed powders, the materials also vary in
rarity and availability. Common materials, such as charcoal, silver
dust, or the simple powdered bone are often sold in guilds, schools,
or apothecaries. Rarer ingredients, such as the blood of celestial beings
or the ground bones of the undead may be much harder to come by.

        It is this very rarity that make scholars loathe to trivially conjure
demons to do their bidding. In times of crisis, lacking the proper supplies
can be painful, if not lethal, to the caster. This rarity also makes masters
of our craft ill-disposed to reveal ingredients which they might consider
valuable.
~
E
chapter4~
Once a symbol has been inscribed in a particular material, the scholar
must then prepare the magical invocation which will call forth the demon.
In general, there are three tiers of demonic invocation, each more potent,
lengthy, and exhausting than the last.

        It should be clear that the more powerful the ritual, so is the more
potent the demon, but what is less obvious is that the same symbol, and the
same ritual can often be used with different rituals to produce differing
demons.

        Most importantly, though, is the knowledge that not every
combination of ritual, symbol, and ingredient will result in a viable
conjured being. Indeed, moreover, these \#dissonant\# combinations,
as they are known, tend to have dire effects on the caster. Sometimes,
exotic will be summoned which will turn on the caster [as the pattern
does not truly control them, being at odds with the laws of demonology].
Other casters have been known to simply vanish after such castings,
or leave behind a dessicated corpse, and so forth.
~
E
chapter5~
When faced with a demon which is the result of a successful
conjuration, there then arises the matter of the Price. For reasons
which elude scholars, this price must be paid in order to bind the
demon to the scholars will. Failure to do so generally results
in unfortunate consequences. 

        The obvious question which arises, of course, is why such
obviously powerful beings would allow themselves to be bound by
we pitiful mortals. In part, we know that the symbols represent
a barrier, or even a trap to demonkind. Still, what compels the demon
to keep once the agreement has been reached?

        It is my belief that while we do have spells which control the
demon, in truth they are not powerful enough to compel their will. Rather,
they are like the token chains that bind a powerful animal. Long ago,
the chains truly bound the creature, but even though they are now more
powerful, they are still restrained by the memory of the chain. Of course,
I do not think this is literally the truth in the case of demonkind. Instead,
I conjecture that either the gods, the ancient alatharya, or some other
powerful entities, took advantage of the inherent rules of the void
to set in place a system of bargains, contracts, and prices that governed
the passage of demons to our world. Those bindings are still in place,
and we tap into them through the use of our elemental magic.
~
E
chapter6~
This brings us to the final section, which concerns the control
of demons once they have been summoned and their price has been
paid. There are really two categories of demons -- those that perform
specific services, and then return to the void, and those that stay at the
scholars side, performing in response to his direct commands.

        Of the ones who remain at the side of the scholar, great care
must be taken. They are bound for various periods of time, which is
determined by the relative power of the demon. At the end of this
period, the scholar must infuse the demons binding with more
magical energy, in order to renew his control for an additional
time interval.

        Sadly, each subsequent infusing of energy into the bond
must be greater than the last. Eventually, the scholar will be unable
to pay the cost in magic to renew the bond, it will break, and there
will be dire results. Fortunately, just as there are summoning spells,
magical research has resulted in an equal and opposite spell to
banish demons back to whence they came. Be warned: Not all
demons are eager to return!
~
E
chapter7~
Demonkind are a fascinating and diverse lot. Some will
fight for the caster, willingly rending flesh and snapping bone
with great enthusiasm. Others, used to service to greater demon
sultans, will act as bodyguard, substituting chitin and blasphemous
growth for soft flesh. And there are a multitude of others -- 
succubi, blobs of alien tissue, spined horrors not the least of them.

        Tread cautiously. Memorize the combination of symbol,
material, spell, and price, so that demons will serve you, rather than
you them.

Carved from pure grey marble and marked with mystical runes, this vault
is an enormous room, easily large enough to hold a stone giant, or even a
dragon.  Supported by enormous tons of stone, the Vault appears designed to
survive a very large amount of punishment.  The once-pristine marble is
scorched a pure ash-black, coated with a thick layer of grimy cinders. 
Long, rent cracks in the stone issue wisps of smoke from time to time, and
each rune glows with renewed spiritlight.  The floor is oddly smooth and
unhurt, the glassy surface now polished to a mirror finish.  To the north, 
a charred archway leads out onto the open, ruined dome.

You stand in a hexagonal gallery, carved from immutable crystal.
Twenty empty, barren shelves sit on all sides of the gallery,
themselves separated by low railings. Peering over the sides of the
gallery reveals an interminable procession of identical chambers, both
above and below as far as the eye can see. Light is provided by two
white lamps, shaped like some spherical fruit and transversally
placed. Exits proceed in all directions from this chamber through
narrow hallways, but it is clear even from a cursory glance that the
chambers in those directions are replicas of this one. Also through
here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards
to remote distances.

You stand in a hexagonal gallery, carved from immutable crystal.
Twenty empty, barren shelves sit on all sides of the gallery,
themselves separated by low railings. Peering over the sides of the
gallery reveals an interminable procession of identical chambers, both
above and below as far as the eye can see. Light is provided by two
white lamps, shaped like some spherical fruit and transversally
placed. Exits proceed in all directions from this chamber through
narrow hallways, but it is clear even from a cursory glance that the

You stand in a hexagonal gallery, carved from immutable crystal.
Twenty empty, barren shelves sit on all sides of the gallery,
themselves separated by low railings. Peering over the sides of the
gallery reveals an interminable procession of identical chambers, both
above and below as far as the eye can see. Light is provided by two
white lamps, shaped like some spherical fruit and transversally
placed. Exits proceed in all directions from this chamber through
narrow hallways, but it is clear even from a cursory glance that the
chambers in those directions are replicas of this one. Also through
here passes a spiral stairway, which sinks abysmally and soars upwards
to remote distances.

The Foyer of the Tower of Aramril~
Carved from light-yellow stones, this caved-in room is the foyer to the
Tower of Aramril, former home of the Champions of the Light.  Rubble and
debris nearly choke the narrow passage remaining through the large chunks of
stone and bent iron portcullis.  A few tattered scraps of once-colorful wall
hangings are seen admist the wreckage, their fragmented scenes showing
moments from brighter days in the history of the Champions.  The courtyard
of the tower opens to the north.  Bloodstains and powdery dustmarks smear
the walls, and a charred stink hangs in the heavy air.

A Despoiled Courtyard~
Rubble-choked exits lead off in the cardinal directions from the ruined
courtyard.  Chinks in the arched ceiling overhead show spots of light
through the cracks and holes in the tower structure above.  A fountain,
partially hidden by fallen stone blocks and still showing black scorch marks
from the shuddeni attack, lies empty in the center of the courtyard.  A
skull has been smashed against the northeastern wall, dried gore spattered
outwards from the point of impact and fragments of bone lying in a pile on the
floor beneath.  Musty air smells of smoke and blood, the atmosphere tense
and uneasy.

Stairwell~
A chipped stone stairwell zigzags its way up the side of the north wall,
leading up to the second floor of the tower.  Half of the original landing
still juts out to provide access to the stairs, but the entire stairwell is
caved in, with tons of the massive yellowish stone partially sealing access
to the upper floors.  The room is dark, and the air tinged with the smells
of smoke, blood, and something more subtle and unpleasant.

The fallen stone completely seals away the side-passages that once led

rubble, as well as smears and trails of a mucous-like, foul-smelling
substance.  The room is dark, the air close and unpleasantly smoky.  A
preternatural haze seems to fill the air.

A Skeletal Sandstone Stairwell~
A chipped stone stairwell zigzags its way up the side of the north wall,
half of the stairs caved in.  Huge gaps and rents look out over the north
forest and the Vale of Aramril.  Considering the massive damage to the
structure, it is wholly remarkable that the stairwell still stands.  A
narrow gap in the rubble still allows a flexible person to move south.  The
debris-clogged stairs continue up and down.

A Skeletal Sandstone Stairwell~
A chipped stone stairwell zigzags its way up the side of the north wall,
half of the stairs caved in.  Huge gaps and rents look out onto a solid,
roiling wall of dense smog.  The curved barrier of oily smoke clings
malevolently to the stone, wrapping the Tower in a dark envelope. 
Considering the massive damage to the structure, it is wholly remarkable
that the stairwell still stands.  A blackened arch allows egress to the
south, and the stairs descend into darkness at your feet.

A Cracked, Open Dome~
You stand on an empty floor beneath a blasted, ruined dome.  The scale of
the dome is quite impressive, or was; now the curvature of the molded stone
is for the most part completely destroyed.  Pieces of rock lie smashed to
bits on the floor, the barest fragments of ornate bas-reliefs still evident
upon them.  Chips of rubble crunch and shift underfoot.  A small metal stair
which once spiralled to the top of the Dome lies twisted and blackened, bent
out of shape and pushed almost completely over.  An enormous arch leads
south, and two smaller arches lead north and east.  The dome is, for the
most part, open to the sky, a dark, sulphuric smog obscuring any light which
might filter in.

The Desecrated Vault of the Champions~
Carved from pure grey marble and marked with mystical runes, this vault
is an enormous room, easily large enoug h to hold a stone giant, or even a
dragon.  Supported by enormous tons of stone, the Vault appears designed to
su rvive a very large amount of punishment.  The once-pristine marble is
scorched a pure ash-black, coated with a th ick layer of grimy cinders. 
Long, rent cracks in the stone issue wisps of smoke from time to time, and
each rune glows with renewed spiritlight.  The floor is oddly smooth and
unhurt, the glassy surface now polished to a mirr or finish.  To the north,
a charred archway leads out onto the open, ruined dome.

portal~
Thin beams of light stream through the shutters of the windows looking
out towards each of the four compass points.  The crude shutters do not
completely block the view however and to the north you can see the vast
realm of Avendar spread out like a beautiful carpet, from the green forests
of Nendor to the distant blue sparkle of the Uthlin Ocean.  West the shimmer
of a bridge of mist catches your eye, and east lies a view of the opposite
tower, glowing in the sunlight.  The shuddeni can overlook the cloudy
expanse to the south for signs of invaders.  The surface of the large desk
in the room is completely covered with battle plans and supply orders from
the front.  The furnishings of this room are imported from the undercities
of the Shuddeni, both plush and extravagant to serve the war-leaders of the
Scourge.  A twisting staircase leads back into the palace.

A Makeshift Prison~
The yellow sandstone walls of this room are scorched and charred, as if
by a great fire.  The floor has been swept clean of the ashes, however, and
several manacles have been secured with metal bolts driven deep into the
rock.  A multifaceted crystal glows with dull red light, illuminating the
room.  A large iron-banded safe sits in one corner.  To the west, a
doorless arch opens out onto a ruined, blasted dome.

multifaceted crystal~
This crystal has been carved into a multifaceted pear shape, seeming like
a blood-red fruit.  Pendulous and almost ripe-seeming, it illuminates the
room in a garish crimson light.  
~
E
portal~
A large chamber spreads before you.  Braziers have been lit in different
parts of the chamber, and dark smoke roils forth, filling the air with ashes
and stinging your eyes.  Stone pillars rise in the middle of the room,
carved with dark runes and horrific images.  Four passages spread from the
corners of this chamber, leading to the altars that pay tribute to the
principles the shuddeni worship.
  
[Exits: north east south west]
(Invis) (Translucent) The high priest of Yithoul stands directing the work of his underlings.
