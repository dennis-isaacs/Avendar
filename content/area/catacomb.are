A twisted, deformed humanoid creature leans against a wall, exhausted.

Stooping before you is a thing that might once have been human, but some
foul process has rendered it too deformed to tell for certain.  Its spine is
twisted, and its left arm is nearly withered away.  Its ribcage extrudes
unatturally over an emaciated, concave stomach.  One of its wide-set eyes
droops nearly halfway down its cheekbone, and the right half of its face is
horribly scarred by acid burns.  One leg is almost half again as long as the
other, and its frame is horribly bruised.

A Dark Cellar~
This cellar appears to have been built to store wines and other niceties;
the dust on its empty shelves, however, must have accumulated over hundreds
of years.  Anything it once held must have been looted and sold long ago by
the poverty-stricken denizens of the house above.  Other than the gaping
hole, wide enough for an Alatharya to walk through, in the south wall, the
place looks entirely bare.

A Smooth-walled Tunnel~
The massive hole torn in the north wall is nearly the only imperfection
in this oddly smooth east-west tunnel.  The gray stone walls almost seem to
reflect your light back at you as you move through the corridor.  Wide
enough for three men to walk comfortably abreast, the nearly circular walls
still make you a bit uncomfortable, as if they were closing in on you.  The
air here, under the city, feels strangely thick, and your breathing seems to
become hoarser with each step.

Bend in a Smooth-Walled Tunnel~
The tunnel sweeps a slow arc east and south here, the smooth walls
curving almost imperceptibly into the blackness to either direction.  The
gray stone remains so oddly smooth that your eyes seem to slide across it
without finding any distinguishing marks to catch on.  Every so often, you
hear unintelligible sounds echoing down the corridors ahead, somewhat
muffled by the thickness of the air.

Council Chamber~
This spacious stone chamber appears to be kept remarkably clean.  The
floor is tiled with some glistening black substance, streaked with veins of
silver.  Resting in the center of the room is an ornate wooden table,
surrounded by thirteen chairs.  All but the chair at the table\@s head are
crafted from some dark, sturdy-looking brown wood with whorls of crimson
paint adorning their backs and legs.  The head chair seems to be made of
some black chitinous substance, forged into a spiked pattern that would not
hold a human comfortably.  On the eastern wall hangs a large tapestry of
vibrant color and intricate detail, depicting some large battle scene.

An Oddly-Formed Chamber~
This nearly rectangular chamber is bisected diagonally by a string of
carved runes, running along the floor from the northwest to the southeast
corner.  Upon closer inspection, you notice that the runes in fact continue
up the nearly ten-foot walls, and a mirror image of the inscription on the
floor traces a similar path across the ceiling.  To the north and east of
the inscription , the walls and floor remain nearly flawlessly smooth, as if
scoured clean.  To the south and west, a drastic change occurs.  The rock is
marked with the outcroppings and indentations that characterize most natural
stone, making the mirror-smooth walls of the other chambers seem even more
unearthly.

A Smooth-Walled Tunnel~
These walls are as smooth as the rest, although the tunnel seems to begin
tapering inward here.  There is a thick slimy residue dripping down the
surface of the south side of the corridor; it almost seems to be giving off
some sort of steam.  To the west, the tunnel opens up into a large
intersection; to the east, it continues, mirror smooth, into shadow.

A Wide Rock Tunnel~
The tunnel here is broad and high, carved into the rock by some powerful,
unseen process.  The stone here is craggy, filled with cracks and crevices,
and probably somewhat treacherous underfoot.  The air is oddly fresh and
clean for an underground tunnel, stirred intermittently by a gentle breeze
that blows from the eastern entrance toward the west.

The surface of the walls is jagged, craggy, covered with indentations and
outcroppings, although the floor seems to have been worn somewhat smoother
by the passage of many feet.  The air is utterly still, disturbed only by
vague echoes from the corridor to the south.

A Wide Rock Tunnel~
The tunnel here is broad and high, carved into the rock by some powerful,
unseen process.  The stone here is craggy, filled with cracks and crevices,
and probably somewhat treacherous underfoot.  The air is oddly fresh and
clean for an underground tunnel, stirred intermittently by a gentle breeze
that blows from east to west.

A Rubble-Strewn Rock Tunnel~
A wide tunnel to the east comes to a sharp end here in this rubble-strewn
rock intersection.  Tunnels to the north and south continue into the dense
blackness, narrowing in either direction.  There are great pits and crevices
all along the corridor here, and dust and debris scattered over the surface.

A Narrowing Tunnel, Dense with Shadows~
The walls of this asymmetric tunnel jut out toward you at odd angles,
creating strange shadow-patterns that play across the floor.  To the south,
it widens a bit, diverging into shadow, and as it angles to the west it
narrows slightly before opening up into what looks to be a large,
well-lighted chamber.

A Rubble-Strewn Rock Tunnel~
This narrow rock tunnel is covered in rocks, dust and debris, with great
gouges carved in the walls and floor.  It widens a bit to the north, and
narrows further into the darkness to the east.  The air is deathly still,
and dust is stirred up at any motion.  The rock here is grayish-brown,
flecked with black and lined with a series of darkening strata that draw the
eyes downward.  The impact to shatter it in so many places must have been
tremendous.

A Small, Rubble-Strewn Chamber~
This chamber, cramped and shadowed, is covered in a thin layer of grey
dust, and chunks and shards of rock are scattered around it in no obvious
pattern.  The only exit is to the west, and there are a few scattered
circular indentations in the dust leading in that direction.  The walls here
appear to have been torn by some massive force, craters the size of a human
head pocking its surface and creating an oddly alien image.

A Subterranean Garden~
You have entered an odd, unearthly chamber.  The tunnel widens here,
abruptly feeding into a cavernous space, where the air is thick with
something you can\@t quite pick out.  The rock here is quite dark, nearly
black, and craggy with ridges and indentations.  A few stalactites and
stalagmites jut out of its surface, spearing into the dank air like teeth in
the maw of some great beast.  Odder still, there are several well-tended
rows of smallish grey mushrooms wending their way around the various black
ridges, with a few quite large ones cropping up at odd angles out of the
floor and walls of the cavern.

A Subterranean Garden~
This cavernous space is almost oppressively silent, save for a few
scratching sounds from the north and a slow dripping of water from an
outcrop above your head, spreading little rivulets through the grainy dust
at your feet.  There are well-tended rows of grey mushrooms here, although
the vagaries of the cavern floor have forced them to be somewhat haphazard
in their growth.  There is no breeze here, and the air is thick with what
might be spores.

This portion of the craggy rock chamber is coated with patches of
slippery-looking greenish mold , with a few rivulets of muddy water running
through and around them.  There is a shadowy alcove carved into the wall to
the north, perhaps large enough for a small child to stand in, about three
feet off the cavern floor.  The cavernous room continues to the east and
south, with a small earthen tunnel leading off into the blackness to the
west.

This rock chamber has a thin dusting of soil on the floor, which thickens
toward the center of the cavern.  The ceiling here is covered with a dense
forest of smaller stalactites, each slowly dripping water onto the floor. 
You notice a scattering of broad leaves, some green, some brown, covering
the central portion of this chamber.  The cavern continues to the north and
east.

This earthen, musty tunnel is quite small, and anyone but a nefortu would
have to bend uncomfortably to walk through it.  To the east, it opens
abruptly into a large, lighted cavern.  To the west, it continues into the
darkness.  The floor of this tunnel is worn with a dense trail of small
circular markings.

This section of the tunnel is wide enough for three humans to walk
abreast, but if the ceiling were any lower they might have to crawl.  The
deep brown soil here is quite moist, relatively smooth above you and quite
crumbled under your feet.  There is a trail of pockmarked indentations
leading east and west.  A faint glow emanates from some opening farther to
the east.

A Cramped Earthen Tunnel~
The tunnel forks sharply here, opening into a slightly larger chamber to
the north and continuing into the inky blackness to the east and south.  At
odd intervals, sluggish eddies of dry, warm air swirl through the tunnel
from the east, but they lack enough force even to break the silence.  A
densely worn path of circular indentations runs through the tunnel from east
to south, with a few fresher-looking trails diverging into the chamber to
the north.

A foul, putrid stench permeates the damp air in this chamber, which
seems unstirred by the small eddies of wind audible from the passage to the
south.  Some distance to the west, beyond the densely-packed soil wall of
the chamber, you hear the unmistakable sound of rushing water.  The floor
seems oddly viscous, squelching unpleasantly underfoot.

The walls seem to close in even tighter here, shrinking to such an extent
that even a shuddeni might feel claustrophobic.  The soil is a deep brown,
tending toward black, and the air is thick and moist.  From far to the west
and above, through the tunnel walls, the distinct sound of rushing water --
and a lot of it -- can be heard.  There is a dense trail of circular marks
on the ground, leading both south and north into the darkness.

A Musty, Crumbling Earthen Tunnel~
The tunnel widens somewhat here, with a narrower section to the north. 
It slowly curves between the north and east, tracing a broad path through
the dark catacombs.  The air here is thick and musty, and the earth is dry,
crumbling a bit with any impact.  The earth has also become somewhat
rockier, with large jagged chunks of granite extruding from the soil at odd
angles.  The trails of circular markings tend to run parallel to these,
diverging around them.

A Musty, Crumbling Earthen Tunnel~
This large tunnel bores an east-west path through the earth, emerging
from darkness and receding into darkness.  The air is uncomfortably thick,
with an odd moldy odor that lingers on your clothes and armor.  The soil is
dry and loose, filling the air with dust at the slightest disturbance.  It
clusters in small piles around the jagged rocks that extrude from its
surface all around the cylindrical tunnel, undisturbed by the passage that
has worn trails in the floor.

passage here, ruffling your garments and cooling you.

The tunnels twist and coil like the tendrils of some great beast,
diverging here to the east, west, and north.  The earth is deepest black,
and has been traversed heavily, by the looks of it.  The ground and
walls have become slightly rockier here, with jagged chunks of granite
extruding from them.  The areas around these rocks appear to have been
cleared away with a reasonable amount of care.

The tunnel abruptly reaches a dead end here, where its diggers seem to
have hit a solid rock wall.  The base of the chamber, just by the wall to
the east, is hollowed out into a bowl-shaped area with a medium-large ring
of stones surrounding it.  This primary ring is perhaps as wide as a grown
man\@s armspan, and deep enough that its bottom cannot be seen from the
entrance to the chamber.  There are smaller indentations, of the same sort,
scattered across the chamber.  Back to the west, the tunnel widens again.

travel.  To the east, it seems to end abruptly some distance ahead, and to

Southward, it narrows somewhat, although the trails of circular indentations
continue in that direction.

the east and west.  There is a strange viscous substance dripping down the
southern wall, and it almost seems to be steaming.

cold, harsh white light that casts stark shadows against the deep grey
walls.  The sound of muffled voices echoes through the corridor, with odd,
stilted cadences.  The corridor is straight, leading from north to south
with no intervening curves.

A Rune-Inscribed Tunnel~
This portion of the tunnel is apparently a small arc in a great circular
passage.  There is a conspicuous absence of any sort of debris or detritus,
and the entire area is well-lit by glowing crystals inlaid in the rock.  The
black rock is set off by a set of deep, blood-red runes inscribed in it,
tracing a slow, arcing path along the floor from northeast to southwest. 
The air here is deathly still and bone-dry, although intermittent noises -
footsteps, low murmurings - signify that the region may not be devoid of
life.

Apprentice Chambers~
This smallish stone room feels quite claustrophobic, crowded as it is
with various objects and and accoutrements of the void templar\@s study.  A
row of bunks lines the northern wall, the mattresses appearing clean but
less than inviting.  The northwestern corner appears intended for weapon
training, with three practice dummies lined up in a row, and wooden practice
weapons and padded vests hung from hooks in the wall.  A row of metal chairs
faces the southern wall, with a large stone podium on a slightly raised
platform jutting out from it.

Guard Chambers~
This wide chamber is sparsely decorated, the monotony of its deep gray
walls of stone broken only by a few small glow-crystals that shed a pale
yellow light about the room.  The north wall is lined with a row of simple
cots, each one with a small wooden crate at its base.  Along the south wall,
a number of low, straw-filled pallets give off a highly unpleasant odor,
amplified in the dry stillness of the air.  On the eastern wall hang a
number of weapon-racks and closets, mostly empty.  On the western wall, near
the only door, is a richly-colored tapestry, depicting some great blue-black
creature arising from a pit, with tiny human and aelin figures cowering in
fear.

A Rune-Inscribed Corridor~
This corridor is perhaps ten feet tall, and almost as wide.  Its deep
grey stone is smooth, and mostly free of debris, though glowing crystals
line the walls at regular intervals.  The center of the corridor\@s floor is
marked by a trail of deep, blood-red runes, Strange, muffled tones break the
stillness of the air at odd intervals, and yet the atmosphere feels somehow
heavy.  To the west, the corridor continues, and to the east it seems to
diverge.

A Rune-Inscribed Tunnel~
This portion of the tunnel is apparently a small arc in a great circular
passage.  There is a conspicuous absence of any sort of debris or detritus,
and the entire area is well-lit by glowing crystals inlaid in the rock.  The
black rock is set off by a set of deep, blood-red runes inscribed in it,
tracing a slow, arcing path along the floor from northeast to southwest. 
The air here is deathly still and bone-dry, although intermittent noises -
footsteps, low murmurings - signify that the region may not be devoid of
life.  On the eastern side of the corridor, a large stone door looms.

Guest Chambers~
This spacious chamber is an odd mix of spartan functionality and great
opulence.  The walls are nearly unadorned, with only an ornate full-length
mirror on the south wall to break the uniformity.  There are two sconces for
torches near the door on the north wall, but both are empty.  The walls are
polished to a nearly mirror-like sheen, and the floor is set with marble
tiles that seem well-kept.  An imposing four-post bed, covered with lush
silken blankets, stands against the wall to the west, while the eastern wall
supports a well-crafted oaken desk.

A Rune-Inscribed Corridor~
This corridor is perhaps ten feet tall, and almost as wide.  Its deep
grey stone is smooth, and mostly free of debris, though glowing crystals
line the walls at regular intervals.  The center of the corridor\@s floor is
marked by a trail of deep, blood-red runes, Strange, muffled tones break the
stillness of the air at odd intervals, and yet the atmosphere feels somehow
heavy.  To the north, the corridor continues, and to the south, it appears
to diverge.

Food Storage~
This clean, bare stone chamber is is lined with a number of wide shelves,
each containing large sacks of flour as well as other dried foodstuffs.  The
air here is quite dry, still, and cool, and it appears that little dust has
been allowed to settle on the floor or on the shelves.  Near the west wall
of the room is a stone pillar, about waist-high to a human, with a large
book attached to its top.  The only exit seems to be a thick stone door set
in the east wall.

nonetheless.  It is ringed by an array of glowing crystals set in the stone,
filling the room with a cold, harsh white light.  The walls here are quite
smooth, nearly reflective in its deep blackness, although it is marred by a
number of burn marks and deep, claw-like striations scoring the walls and
ceiling.  On the floor, there is marked a rather simple pattern, laid out in
blood-red runes that seem almost to writhe: four rays leading from the
center of the chamber to doorways in each of the cardinal directions, and
three concentric circles, the largest nearly flush with the walls and the
smallest perhaps the armspan of a human in diameter.

Upon closer examination, two things become evident: the runes form an
unbroken line, each connected to the next, and the color is not some paint
but actual blood, viscous to the touch, but seemingly a part of the rock
itself.

A Rune-Inscribed Corridor~
This corridor is perhaps ten feet tall, and almost as wide.  Its deep
grey stone is smooth, and mostly free of debris, though glowing crystals
line the walls at regular intervals.  The center of the corridor\@s floor is
marked by a trail of deep, blood-red runes, Strange, muffled tones break the
stillness of the air at odd intervals, and yet the atmosphere feels somehow
heavy.  To the east, the corridor continues, and to the west it ends in a
stone door.  Another broad stone door is set in the wall to the south.
