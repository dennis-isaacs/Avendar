    say You can find common stone easily enough. Granite tends to be the main mass of the great mountain ranges, and it makes up most of the deeper stone layers as well.
    say Sandstone is more plentiful in the western regions round about Earendam, or in the dry southlands. Shale, though, is found in and around great river valleys and swamps.

    break

A Large Cavern~
A large cavern stretches before you into darkness.  The ceiling is
covered with hanging stalactites, and mighty stalagmites reach up from the
cave floor, obstructing your path in some areas.  The cavern echoes with
faint fluttering sounds, and the clicking of something hard against the
stone walls.

The narrow tunnel opens into a broad, dry cave to the east, and joins
with another narrow tunnel to the west.  Flakes of stone crumble off the
walls as you edge through the narrow opening, and the shards crunch beneath
your feet.

Three cave tunnels converge into a small open area.  The floor of the
cave is covered with a thin layer of mud, caused by the droplets of water
dripping steadily from the stalactites overhead.  Several large stones have
been pulled together in a circle, apparently used as chairs.  A number of
footprints are visible in the mud of the floor, making it clear that several
bipeds have been in the area recently.  The cave slopes slightly upward to
the west, rising out of the mud, and a broad cave leads to the north.

to observe the incredible phase spider devouring more helpless mortals.  A

A Winding Tunnel~
The walls of this tunnel curve sharply, twisting about through the earth.
The cave floor is covered with a layer of rounded pebbles, such as one would
find at the bottom of a stream.  Patches of lichens color the walls, and the
air is damp and moist.

An Oddly Formed Tunnel~
This tunnel seems to be unnatural, but the walls do not appear to have
been worked with chisels.  The marks are unusual, as if something had
scraped, rather than chipped, the stone away, and then polished it to a fine
glow. The fungus of the cave seems to flourish on this odd surface, as
several patches of white mushrooms grow from the walls and floor.

A Dark Pit~
As you step into the darkness, stones skitter beneath your feet, and you
slide down a steep cave wall.  You land on a ledge in a pitch black crevice.
No handholds are available to return upwards, but the ledge seems to slope
sharply downward just beyond your resting place.  From below, a faint breeze
brings the slight odor of carrion.

The narrow cave widens slightly into a small open area, and to the

from the ceiling echoes throughout the small cavern.  A slight breeze drifts
up from the depths of the dark tunnel, carrying the faint odor of carrion
with it.

The Phase Spider\@s Lair~
The trapdoor opens into a large cave underneath the maze.  Several
humanoid corpses lay about, dried and crumbling.  The smell of carrion grows
stronger inside the lair, but it is still muted.  The walls are lined with
web cocoons which held the phase spider\@s victims still while it fed.
