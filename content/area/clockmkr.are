clockmaker man clockmakerguy~
the Clockmaker~
The Clockmaker scuttles about, spider-like, on spindly mechanical limbs.
~
Ten many-jointed brass limbs arch from the twisted torso of the old
clockmaker.  Little is left of his skinny, hunched frame - from the base of
his chest downward, his body is a clockwork monstrosity.  Wheels and gears
turn where his abdomen once was, driving six long, clawed legs, which
skitter about as if with a mind of their own.  Melded with the stumps of his
shoulders are four further limbs - one pair ending in mechanical hands, each
with seven multi-jointed fingers, and another, longer pair ending in
scythe-like blades.  

The Clockmaker is grey-haired and wrinkled.  One of his eyes has been
replaced by a construction of lenses and whirring apertures.  In his
remaining good eye, a frantic madness gleams.

Constance~
A girl lies upon the stone bier, eyes closed and utterly motionless.
~
The Clockmaker\@s lovely young daughter, Constance, lies resting upon the
stone bier in the center of the chamber.  She is dressed in a simple gown of
white silk, a shade paler than her smooth, milky skin.  Her flaxen hair
spreads across pillow, cascading over the lip of the bier.  The girl\@s
delicate hands hold an ornate wooden box closely to her breast.

A neatly-dressed ghost sits in the dusty, linen-shrouded armchair with
one leg crossed primly over the other.  Its smoky, transparent form is of an
old man, with thinning hair combed neatly across his balding pate.  It is
impeccably attired in a pressed butler\@s suit, with a neat cravat and

the clockwork hound~
A clockwork hound, made all of brass and iron, stands ticking here.
~
A mechanical dog, crafted from various metals, moves about in a perfectly
life-like fashion, apparently under the power of its clockwork innards.  The
frame of the hound is of iron, which forms it ribs, flexible spine and
hinged legs.  Plates of brass cover parts of its legs and his
friendly-looking head.  A mass of whirring clockwork can be seen between his
iron ribs, its cogs and flywheels buzzing and its gears shifting as the
creature moves about.  The mechanoid has eyes of crystal, which gleam
brightly, and a segmented tail of brass which wags back and forth.

A hawkish-faced man with deeply-tanned skin paces about the chamber.

This tall man\@s dark, hawkish features are reminscent of the folk of the

ringlets about his brooding eyes.  Despite his exotic cast, Marid is dressed

corpse shambling wife Clockmaker\@s Clockmakers Clockmakerswife Adele~
the Clockmaker\@s wife~
A shambling corpse, animated by gears and springs, lurches by the south wall.
~
Systems of gears and springs have been built into the joints of the
long-dead corpse of a woman to grant it a lurching, clumsy animation.  The
whirring clockwork hangs in racks from its formaldehyde flesh, driving
springs and belts which pierce the withered skin, to work in the place of
its dead musculature.  A hole scooped out of the side of its head reveals an
intricate, buzzing mechanism.  

The woman must have already been old when she died, with a bent, age-wracked
frame and long, whispy white hair.  The preserved flesh now sags in the
construct of brass and iron, and its head lolls about erratically with the
movement of the whole, casting its vacant, cataract glare about the room.  

It lurches back and forth around the south end of the room, its only focus
being the constant rubbing of its left ring finger with its purple right
hand.

gargoyle stone demonic eastern~
a demonic stone gargoyle~
A demonic stone gargoyle leers malevolently over the southern face.
~
This stone gargoyle has been chiselled to resemble a classical demon. 
Its body is short, muscular, and hunched over.  Its head is bulbous, with an
exaggerated, leering grin and oversized canines, and two horns sprout from
its forehead, curving outward to sharp points.  Stone wings sprout from its
back, crafted to resemble the wings of some giant bat.  Looking more
carefully at the creature, it appears that there are joints and seams
between its limbs and appendages, as though to allow movement.

Sinthestin srryn vicious vicious-looking mottled grey mottled-grey~
Sinthestin~
A vicious-looking, mottled-grey srryn stands here, counting his jewels.
~
This reptilian horror stands some six feet tall, even hunched over as he
is.  Long, muscular arms hang down to his knees, gripping a heavy,
iron-headed spear.  His grey-green scales are mottled from head to sinuous
tail with dark blotches.  A long-muzzled maw gapes slightly, lined with many
jagged teeth.

a snowy-winged hawk~
A large, snowy-winged hawk flies between the roof beams.
~
This large hawk has sleek, greyish-brown feathers, which become a snowy
white along the edges of his wide wings.  The hawk swoops about the upper
reaches of the dilapidated entrance hall, occasionally landing on a roof
beam or window sill, and peering about territorially.

A wiry srryn, clad in hides, leans against a gorse bush.

This srryn is of small stature, with the thin, sinuey frame suited to
trackers and spies.  His scales are greyish-green, and his heavy-lidded eyes
are yellow.  He licks his lips compulsively, and leans, as though at ease,
on one of the spindly gorse bushes which stud the mire.

Wallowing in the mud and mire, this srryn seems little more than a savage
beast.  His ragged scales are a dull brown, covering a strong, long-limbed
frame.  Dull red eyes watch you with an animal wariness, mixed with
bloodlust, and taloned hands grip a crude wooden club.

stolen, and now much the worse for wear.  Beneath the coat a study sheath
hangs from his belt, alongside a wooden cudgel, which dangles to his knees.

a brutish srryn~
A huge, brutish srryn, covered in horny green scales, stands by the fire.
~
A reptillian srryn stands here, hunched and massive, gnawing on a
half-cooked haunch as he warms his scaly hide by the fire.  The beast is a
particularly brutish example of this under-evolved race, stooping under the
weight of its own massive torso, its long tail stretched out behind for
balance.  The creature\@s scales are dull green, and form thick, horny ridges
along his back.

a blue heron~
An elegant blue heron struts through the shallows on long legs.
~
This large water bird walks slowly through the shallows, placing one long
leg carefully in front of the other, as it pecks occasionally at the mud
with its long, pointed beak.  Its feathers are more charcoal-grey than blue,
although an azure sheen is visible when the light catches its attractive
crest.

A brown-feathered moorhen paddles about, searching for food.

This dull-looking waterbird paddles about in the water, its duck-like
head bobbing beneath the surface as it scrounges for algae and small
insects.  Its feathers are brown, darkening towards the head, and its wings
and tail are tipped with white.

the harlequin marionette~
A bright harlequin marionette stands en garde, its strings trailing behind.
~
Standing about three feet tall, this wooden puppet is carved in the form
of a miniature man.  The figure is dressed in a bright harlequin outfit -
baggy trousers and a frilly shirt, stitched together from multi-colour
diamonds.  A triangular-brimmed hat sits askew atop its wooden head, which
has been carved with a large nose and a cheeky grin.  The marionette\@s
strings trail from its arms, legs and head as it moves about, dragging along
a pair of wooden crosses.  A steel poniard is attached to its right hand,
which it holds aloft like a tiny rapier.

the stuffed clown doll~
A stuffed clown doll stands here, bearing a sharp knife and a demented grin.
~
Now violently animate, this stuffed clown doll moves with frightening
speed and clear purpose.  The sharp knife in its plush, silken hand is
wielded with remarkable skill, made all the more dangerous by the prodigious
leaps which carry the little doll to roughly throat-height.  Its other hand
hangs limp and lifeless, charred and blackened to the elbow.  The demented
grin is still fixed on the clown\@s face, but is now even wider, and its
beady eyes gleam with murderous intent.

A mechanical cat, armoured in painted porcelain, crouches to pounce.
~
This beautiful model cat is built from shining steel, and armoured with
sleek plates of porcelain.  The inner workings of the cat seem highly
sophisticated.  The clockwork motor in its chest cavity whirs with
mechanical precision, driving its agile frame.  The white porcelain covering
has been painted with black and ginger stripes - halfway between the
patterning of an alleycat and a tiger.  Two green crystals form its eyes,
and fine strands of plaited gold serve as whiskers.

A beautiful clockwork owl, finished in silver, flies about the chamber.

This silver owl is a work of masterful smithcraft.  The attention to
detail employed in its creation is exquisite - from its individually molded
feathers, to its huge, hand-crafted eyes of obsidian and pearl.  As well as
being a piece of art, this clockwork bird is also a rather deadly construct
- it flies about the chamber with great agility, its steel-tipped talons
outstretched.

A tiny dragon, made all of copper and jade, swoops above.

The slender, sinuous body of this tiny model dragon is only about three
feet from snout to tail-tip, although its wing span is half again as long. 
The body of the construct is covered in articulated plates of copper,
overlapping sections of pure jade.  The limbs supporting the wings appear to
be green-tinted steel, and the wing membrane itself a fan of long, thin
copper leaf.  The dragon\@s eyes appear to be moonstones, and gaze
enigmatically from the copper and jade face.

boar brass small clockworkbeast~
the brass boar~
A small, brass boar, its short limbs run by clockwork, charges about the room.
~
This clockwork boar is perhaps the simplest of the mechanical devices in
the chamber.  Its only moving parts are four stumpy legs, which project from
the base of its compact body, which is heavily-armoured in plates of brass. 
The boar\@s head is fixed rigidly to its body, and its porkine features have
been only crudely rendered.  However great attention seems to have been paid

the sinewy srryn bandit~
A sinewy srryn bandit lurks in the mire, its huge, yellow eyes glaring.
~
This srryn\@s long frame is tightly-knit with sinewy, corded muscles. 
Crouching slightly in the mud, it gives the impression of a coiled spring
ready to strike.  Bright yellow eyes glare hugely from its short-snouted
face, offsetting the dull swamp-green of its coarse scales.

A large, black-scaled lizard raises its crest of spines in warning.
~
The entire length of this massive lizard, a a good six feet from the tip
of its long tail to its hissing mouth, is covered in horny, black scales. 
Running from between its prominent brow-ridges to half-way down its back is
a magnificent, webbed crest of spines.  Detecting motion nearby, the lizard
now raises its crest into a deadly-looking sail of spikes, and tenses to
attack.

the enormous crested lizard~
An enormous, black-scaled lizard is chained here, its spiny crest undulating languidly.
~
Like its smaller cousins, this enormous specimen is covered from tail to
snout with jagged, black scales.  In the case of this beast, the scales
(where not covered in mud or scar tissue) gleam brightly, as though the
creature were especially well fed.  Its huge, spiny crest undulates up and
down with a languid air - both confident and menacing.  A small hole has
been cut in the crest webbing just above the neck, to allow the fitting of a
thick, iron collar, with a short chain pinned to the ground.

This wiry dog has been bred for speed and bloodlust, and most of all for

a savage hunting dog~
A savage-looking hunting dog, its coarse hair bristling, stalks along.
~
This wiry dog has been bred for speed and bloodlust, and most of all for
tenacity.  It trots around the yard on muscular legs, its boney ribcage
showing through its coarse hair.  It emits a deep-throated growl at anything
which moves, the hair along its prominent spine bristling in challenge.

iron ribs, with cogs, gears and flywheels completely still.  A section of
the clockwork appears to have been tampered with.  The mechanoid has eyes of

14th of the Reaping

The Guardian has been completed.  It has the strength to hold the pendulum
still, and kill any who seek to move it.  It was not easy!  With supplies so
low, I had to scavenge parts from Constance\@s toys to complete it.  The
clockwork brain from that toy snake of hers, and an iron cog from the hound.
The music box has gone missing, which worries me.  But no matter!  No one
will make the connection.  As for the hound, well,it was the only creation
of mine which might have stood up to the Guardian.  And once Constance is
under the Chronometer\@s sway, she will no longer need its protection.  Until
then, I shall hide the hound in the caretaker\@s cottage so that she does not
find it broken.

1st of the Reaping

This is a great day.  The Chronometer has at last been completed, and the
pendulum set swinging with perfect rhythm.  I can feel the very waves of
time flowing from the base of the tower, metering out every second within
its vicinity.  All who come near the Chronometer will feel its pull, and so
be drawn into whatever flow of time my masterpiece decrees.  No longer shall
fugitive time run free, passing with unrestrained abandon!  No longer will
it take away those I love!  Once time is tamed, we shall be safe from its
ravages.

The servants have abandoned me.  I suppose they found my fervor too much to

journal1~
Skimming through the journal, you come across many entries of a technical
nature - drawings, measurements, and discussions on this or that component,
and plans regarding what next to build.  Toward the end of the journal,
spanning a period of a few years, the writer seems to be focusing on a
single, magnificent creation.  It\@s impossible to tell exactly what, as the
drawings are quite complex and abstract, although it seems to be a massive,
room-sized time piece of some description.  As this work progresses, the
handwriting be becomes spidery, scrawled and hard to read.  The writer
seems to be becoming more and more obsessed.  The final couple of pages are
in clear handwriting again, and the entries become highly agitated and
fervent. They read as follows: 

The Dragon\@s Feast

Ah, recalcitrant time!  Have I not given you enough these past decades?  For
five generations my family have served you as the greatest clockmakers in
the world, and for sixty years I myself have been your herald and your
doomsayer.  Each clock I built was monument to your mastery of the lives of
men.  Each silver face, gilded hand, and pendulum of brass an acknowledgement
of the inevitability of your grasp.  Now my wife is in your talons - I could
not save her, though it broke my heart to watch Adele slowly die.  I have
given you all that is mine, but my daughter I hold back!  You shall not have
her! I shall master you, and bend your passing to my own will!  No longer
shall my creations merely gauge your passing, eaking out your flow in
meager, devastating portions.  I shall build a device that holds you, binds
you, and masters you.  Thus will Constance be saved from your claws.  
~
E
journal~
This thick journal, bound in fine leather, contains hundreds of rough-cut
parchment pages.  On the front cover an emblem of a silver clock face is
emblazoned.  The tome appears to be full of a dense, spidery handwriting,
interspersed with sketches and technical drawings - most of it very
difficult to understand.  Skimming through the book reveals 8 legible
sections, which you can read with \@read journal <number>\@.

Standing in the center of this dilapidated building is an old, wooden
carriage.  The vehicle looks like it may have once been quite fine, trimmed
generously as it is with ornate carving and gilded patterns.  Now its paint
is badly faded, and it seems to slouch slightly on its heavy, spoked wheels.
These wheels still look functional, and are held from rolling toward the
back of the carriage house by a set of wooden blocks.  

The doors to the carriage also appear to be working, allowing you to open
them and enter the carriage if you wish.

An old, enclosed carriage plows its way downhill though the forest here,

A wrecked carriage leans against the westen wall of this room, completely
blocking the door in that wall.  The carriage looks like it might once have
been quite fine, with ornate carvings and gilded patterning across much of
its surface.  Now it is a ruin, apparently having smashed through the
northern wall of this room after a violent passage through the woods.  

One of the doors still seems to work, however.  You could open it and enter
the carriage, if you wish.

Two wooden blocks are wedged under each of the carriage\@s rear wheels to

Upon closer inspection, this small, plush doll reveals itself to be a
lovingly detailed study in grotesquery.  The skin of the doll is of silk
stocking, the colours and contours of its face picked out with multi-hued
patches, while protrusions of crimson material form a bulbous nose and
cauliflower ears.  The clown\@s mouth is fixed in an absurdly wide grin,
drawn back into its face with deep stitchwork.  In conjunction with its
beady, black-stud eyes and tussock of woolly, green hair, this demented grin
imbues the doll with an air of severe mania.  The clown\@s clothing, though
once brightly-coloured and extravagant, are now age-worn and frayed,
revealing in many places the amorphous, white bulges of the clown\@s stuffed
interior.  Much of the left arm has been badly burned, revealing a charred
wooden under-skeleton beneath, and the soles of its little silken shoes are
covered with old soot.  

In the course of the battle, a great hole has been torn in the doll\@s torso.
Inside, surrounded by greasy, woollen stuffing, a small, wooden key has been
stowed.

  Standing next to it is a  small box protruding a wooden key, with 
  drawings of musical notes drifting above it.

A child\@s handwriting below the picture reads:

This is Selwyn Two-tongues. He sleeps at the end of my bed, but always 
wakes up when someone comes near. Once Zig tried to sneak up on me while 
I was asleep. When I woke up, Zig was all wrapped up by Selwyn Two-tongues.

music from my silver music box. He stops whatever he\@s doing to listen to

This is my best friend Roly. He comes with me wherever I go, and is very, 
very brave. Once when I went for a walk in the forest he killed a wolf 
that was trying to eat me! Daddy gave him to me when mommy first got sick.

A child\@s handwriting below the picture reads:

This is Zig. He\@s a clown. He\@s not a very nice clown. He\@s always trying 
to play mean tricks on me, but the other toys stop him, especially Selwyn 
Two-tongues. Because of that, Zig hates Selwyn, and keeps stealing my 
music box key so that Selwyn can\@t listen to it. Zig\@s arm is all black 
because he once caught on fire from a spark from the fireplace. Now he 
hates fire as much as he hates Selwyn.

Vibrant watercolours have been used to portray this extravagantly 
  costumed marionette. Black strokes, representing strings, trail upwards 
  from its limbs, while in its little wooden hand a toy sword is held up 
  in salute.

A child\@s handwriting below the picture reads:

This is Saraband. Saraband thinks he\@s a knight, but he\@s really much too 
small to be one. He also likes to play copying games. If you win the game 
he\@ll follow you around and do anything you say. Sometimes it gets annoying 
when he follows me everywhere, so I take his strings, and he turns into an 
ordinary puppet again.

   Indeed, it is that last vestige of honour which I hope to preserve 
   in this desperate act. In my long tenure as butler in this madhouse - 
   nay, as butler, seneschal, councilor, and nursemaid - I have held two 
   things close to my heart: my bearing, poise and dignity, and poor, 
   dear, little Constance. Now that the latter is no more, I shall at 
   least salvage the former in death. Perhaps my bones will never lie in 
   a quiet grave beneath the forest eaves, but at least He will never 
   come for me. 

   So I have locked up the mansion for the last time tonight. If any now

sundial~
This simple sundial of carved bluestone stands right in the center of the
old graveyard.  Its pedestal is choked with a thick growth of nettles, which
send shoots upward to probe the wide, circular face of the monument.  The
face itself is layered with pale, blue marble, with the numerals of the
hours molded into it.  In the center of this face is a decorative inset - a
brass heart encircled by a golden ring.  From the center of the heart rises
the gnomon; a spire of marble carved into the form of a man and woman
embracing.  
~
E
groove~
A deep groove runs between the golden ring and the outer marble surface of
the sundial.  There is a small hinge at one point in the groove, suggesting
that the inset is actually a hatch, which might be opened.  
~
E
gnomon~
The gnomon is a vertical spire of pale blue marble, about five inches
high, carved into the form of a man and woman embracing.  Although the
carving is relatively simplistic, it gives the impression of two people very
much in love.  Normally, on a sunny day, the gnomon would cast its shadow
toward the outer numerals on the sundial\@s face, and so tell the time. 
However the thick, overhanging canopy of the forest keeps the gnomon in
perpetual shadow.  

The gnomon stands in the center of the image of a brass heart, surrounded by
a ring of gold.  
~
E
numerals~
A series of numerals are carved into the marble at the edge of the
sundial\@s face.  They are quite arcaic in style, suggesting that the sundial
is very old.

history1~
In the beginning, were the gods. Some to create,
some to destroy, some to taint, others to bring
hope, others to simply be. The gods, though, were
alone in the universe. Seeking a canvas for their
essence, they created the world of Avendar.
And, edged along ever so carefully by the gods
of creation, they created the alatharya,
first children of the gods. 

To the alatharya, the gods gave their greatest
gift - Magic. Magic to create, magic to destroy,
some portion of each of the gods\@ essences was 
sent to swirl through the prime material, creating 
the ether, the Quintessence from which mages drew 
their power.

As time passed, the alatharya waxed mighty. The
gods, pleased, began plans for other creations,
each mighty in their own way. But the Alatharya
were not content with the god\@s plans to make
others - jealous of the thought that other
children might bring the god\@s attention away
from them, and coveting the Quintessence, they
sought to steal the power of the gods. With their
mighty pyramids, and strange rites, their priests
and scholars came together one fateful night for
a grand theft. In their hubris, they sought to
steal the power of the gods for themselves, and
make of themselves Creators. 

But, alas, it was not to be. The gods knew of the
theft, and instead of invoking the power of the
gods, they invoked their deepest and darkest
wrath. All across Avendar, the great cities of the
alatharya were rent in blood and fire - their
libraries burned, their pyramids turned to
rubble, their homes driven to the four winds. The
revenge of a god is not a small thing, and the
revenge of the combined might of a pantheon can
level entire worlds. So it was that the Alatharya
were cast from their pinnacle as the mightiest of
races. No more would the minds of the Alatharya
follow the intracies of magic - nor would the
Alatharya do nought than strive for balance in
their day to day life, fearful of retribution for
their ancient crime. And, lastly, the gods
sundered Magic from its pure form into its
elemental components. Water, Spirit, Wind, Fire,
Void, and Earth did it break them, and forever
shatter the mortal dream of attaining the divine
through mystic arts. 
~
E
history2~
This sundering of the Magic released cataclysmic
storms of magic over the surface of Avendar, which
changed and alteried all that they touched. Of the
god\@s new children, vast changes were wrought,
some for good, some for ill. The aelin were
granted flight, and the gift of keen reason. The
caldarans learned wisdom, and were turned from
the night. At the same time, the brutal srryn
were born, spawn of languid swamp and foul
hearts. Beneath the earth fled the shuddeni,
blind minions of pure darkness, driven mad, some
say, by a love of much knowledge. 

The centuries after the Sundering of Magic were
dark ones. It was not until some hundreds of
years that civilization began anew, with the proud
selin and their cities in the skies. Striving,
perhaps, for a memory of things past, they
collected the artifacts of the ancient slatharya,
and built cities that at least faintly echoed the
glories of ancient days. 

And so it was the selin waxed powerful, the
srryn confined to their torpid swamps and the
shuddeni to their caves, and all others brought
into alliance with them. For a time, it appeared the
world would never again know such a destruction,
until, at last, the gods allowed a new race to
awaken on Avendar - the humans. 

The humans were taken by any and all things,
some easily swayed to evil, others relentless
paragons of virtue. Some claimed them akin to
gods, others to devil-spawn of the Void, others
still to reckless children. Nevertheless, the
passion that drove the humans lead them, at first,
into a reckless alliance with the brutal srryn. 
~
E
history3~
In their midnight rituals, the srryn had learned
much of the ways of fire. Fire to burn, fire to
make their will be done - fire, to destroy. The
humans, always more keen of wit, seized the
secrets of the srryn fire shamans, cultivated
among their numbers the first Scholars of Fire.
Savage men, of an unholy taste for pleasure and
power, unleashed their magics across the surface
of Avendar. 

Securing the yoke about their fellow men, the
great Scholars of Fire also trained warlords, or
templars of fire, to command in battle with the
sword, and yet still reign destruction with the
forces of fire. Most of the races scattered
before the hordes of humans and srryn that
plundered all they found, but the aelin stood to
defend their cities, and forged an alliance to
fight to keep the humans at bay, lest the night
consume all. 

Cities were reduced to ash. Aelin died in droves,
using their already small collection of ancient
artifacts to drive the humans back. And yet, again
and again the humans surged forward. Quick to
breed, quick to die, the humans stood at the
verge of a destruction that would consume all. 

Fortunately, not all among the humans thought as
the Scholars of Fire. Small in number, but
present, were humans who sought meaning in
more than brute destruction. Groping blindly,
they sought to bring peace, to heal, to purify.
They craved a life spent in other activity than
blind devotion to an orgy of chaos and
destruction. 

Praying to the gods, they were answered. Jolinn,
Father of the Seas, Lord of the Sapphire Spear,
sent these brave few to seek the titans, who
dwelt high in the mountains, where they had
slumbered since the Sundering. Waking, they
taught the humans of the magics of Water, and of
the strength of the Seas. These humans
returned, and became the first of the Scholars
of Water. Born to bring healing to a troubled
land, their love of life quenched the inferno of the
fire mage\@s hate. With their aid, the aelin drove
the armies of Fire back to the swamps, where
most of the Scholars of Fire were put to the
sword. 

Thus ended what the chronicles tell of as the War
of Fire, when men nearly brought ruin once more
to the world. 
~
E
history4~
And yet, the aelin were not the ones to come to
dominance after the war. The humans, their
passion driving them still, slowly grew in numbers
across the surface of Avendar, while the aelin
remained in their cities, lost in the intracicies of
their own life. 

Those humans not already devoted to healing
learned much of the ways of earth from the god
Iandir, who brought law once more to the hills and
valleys of Avendar. Men paused in their mad
growth, and built cities, homes, places of staying,
order, and protection. 

And thus, many thousands of years passed.
Quarrels came and went, but none so great as a
war to drench and entire world in Fire. And so it
was that the empire of the Humans subsumed the
entire world. And yet, the humans were drawn to
more than just the surface, and began their
explorations of the nether regions of Avendar.
There, they found the great cities of the
shuddeni, a race blinded by the night, but who
still saw much, and gloried in the horror of the
demon sultans who taught them. 

Here, human scholars went who wished to learn
more. Tortured they were by the shuddeni, but
some, a few, learned their ways. Combining the
ritual of the shuddeni with the ancient learning of
the humans, the discipline of the Void was born. 

Who can say why the gods suffer such things to
exist? Certainly, the gods of the dark revel in the
Void, the Things which inhabit it not always of
their own creation, but often after their own
heart. Certainly, what the Scholars of the Void
did was the antithesis of life, and everything
living, but the gods of light could not bring and
end to them without disturbing the balance of the
world. 

So it was, those humans who studied with the
Shuddeni waxed mighty in their counsels, and
taught the shuddeni much of the ways of war. The
shuddeni culture, grown stagnant in their
millennia under stone, was re-energized by the
promise of conquest above the surface. On the
blackest night, of the darkest day of the year,
the humans and their shuddeni allies road forth
from the caves of their dank abyss, to usher in an
age of Night the world had never known. 
~
E
history5~
Striking with meaning, order, and purpose rather
than out of blind rage, the forces of the Void
took cities, rather than burning them, and
corrupted them to their will. Mothers were
forced to offer their children as appeasement in
unholy rites, designed to serve the Things which
dwell beyond, some were kept as slaves, but the
cities under the sway of the Void lived, even if
they were more the corpses of cities than
anything resembling a living organism. 

The templars of water mounted counter-assault
after counter-assault. Some times, with success,
other times, with failures. For long 
years, the two sides held sway in a series of
enormous battles. With time, thought, the
Scholars of Water found their magic growing
weaker - the Things of the void had grown strong
on the flesh of the young, and pressed for more
mortal flesh. When all seem darkest, when even
great Earandam thought to send its children to
the aelin amidst the moutain, the unthinkable
happend in the ranks of the Void. 

Their dark rites prepared, their rituals chanted,
they brought forth not demons or other Things,
they brought forth instead the ch\@taren. The
ch\@taren, whether exiles from the world of
dreams or even the fabled astral plane, had used
the magic of the void against itself, and had
travelled into the Prime Material by means of
their gateways. 

Bringing with them large numbers and the magics
of the Spirit, they routed the dreadlord templars
of the void to their holes in the ground, where
those that served Fire waited, and picked off the
weak among them. Humans learned of the
freedom of the Spirit, and everywhere, cast off
their chains, and drove the fiends of the Void
back once more into seclusion. 

And, thus ended the War of the Night, where
men learned that the candle of hope flickers even
in the blackest of times. 
~
E
history6~
The ch\@taren settled among men, whose empire
lies shattered. The other races, long secluded by
humankind, came forth to a new Renaissance.
Some learned of the ways of the aelin, and
brought forth their own creation - the magic of
Air, which sought no rule, order, or code, merely
meaning in its own chaotic existence. 

Thus, all six of the great elemental magics were
brought to Avendar. Men, in time, sought to form
again their empire, but found the world too vast a
place - Ethron inhabitants of forest oaks, Dark
winged nefortu dangling in their dark places,
and even the alatharya of yore were returned in
diminished form. 

Still, for a time men formed a Republic on the
main continent of their home, but, in recent times,
these alliances were sundered by the raids of the
Kankoran barbarians and their allies. This has
resulted in the city states we see today -
Earandam the grand, Var Bandor, and even Ashta
Harrud, desert capitol of commerce. 

All races today find more meaning in finding their
own niche in the struggle for power, rather than a
great gasp at one empire. The Houses of Avendar
reflect this diversification of thought among the
people of Avendar. Likewise, the Scholars\@
Towers, were even the mages of void and spirit
exist in an uneasy detente. 

Moreso than any time in history, the world is a
wide place, separated by long distances, with
opportunity awaiting around every street corner
in the great cities. A time, where, perhaps, the
future belongs to those who would take it, and
dare to tread the Siege Perilous - a time for
adventurers.....

Beneath the Bandits\@ Shelter~
A few sheets of canvas form the sloping roof of this crude shelter, held
in place by a row of birch trees to the north, and a thick growth of
white-flowered privet to the south.  The privet also grows to the west,
although more thinly, and a wall of blackberries blocks the eastern exit. 
The floor of the shelter is littered with blankets, filthy clothing, and
shabby personal belongings of little worth - clearly the refuge of an
unsavoury gang.

A Collapsed Room~
This entire section of the building, both this floor and the one above,
has collapsed.  The north, south and west walls still stand, but the eastern
wall is destroyed and the sky is visible high overhead.  Broken stones and
shattered roof tiles lie strewn across the ground in a pile, and the forest
seems to be making an effort to reclaim this place, as lichen, moss and ivy
thread the rubble, and grasses push their way between the stones.  

A fastly closed door stands in the western wall, partially blocked by fallen
stones, and a gaping hole leads into a room to the south.  A very strong

The Gutted Servant\@s Quarters~
The walls and ceiling of this room seem mostly intact, although interior
seems to have been hit by a cyclone.  Cots, cupboards, and other,
indistinguishable wooden furniture lie splintered and scattered about the
chamber.  Here and there moss and ivy encroaches from the surrounding
forest, and small animal shapes scurry for cover amidst the debris.  A

A Flooded Chamber~
This room is fitted out as a general work area for the servants, with a
number of stone wash basins against the west wall, a small oven and cooking
area in the southeast corner, and a number of tables and benches scattered
about.  A wooden stairway rises from the center of the room through a hole
in the ceiling.  Now the chamber is flooded with murky water, as rain
falling through the ceiling hole has had no means of escape.  The stagnant
pool is a foot deep in places, lapping at the legs of tables, and spawning
thick algae on the stone walls.  

Besides the stairway up, the only exit from the room is a single door is set
in the northern wall.

Little remains of this upper-story room.  Only the north and west walls

The Balcony Over the Ballroom~
A narrow balcony, ballustraded in mouldy teak, occupies a short stretch
of the northern wall of this great hall, many feet above the floor.  Part of
the balcony has collapsed, leaving only enough room for two or three people
to stand here safely.  High above, the fluted columns which line the walls
can be seen to splay outwards, joining the vaulted arches of the ceiling in
floral capitals.  Between the pillars are set high, arched windows of
stained glass, which bathe the hall in coloured motes.  

A narrow, spiralling staircase of wrought iron leads to the ballroom floor
below, while a set of double doors lead from the balcony in the north wall.

The first window depicts the height of ancient alatharya civilization,
with their pyramids and mightly floating cities.  The alatharya figures
depicted are almost god-like in their nobility.  
~
E
second~
The second window clearly represents the Sundering.  A circle of
distressed alatharya surround a pyramid in the center of the window, while
the rest of the window is rent into four segments with jagged lead borders. 
Each of these segments is patterned to represent one of the four elements -
earth, air, fire and water.  
~
E
third~
The third panel depicts the slow rebirth of civilization after the
Sundering.  The great aelin cities, salvaged from the ruins of the alatharya
cities, occupy the upper region of the window, well separated from the races
struggling on the surface of Avendar.  
~

Again, this window shows civilization\@s recovery and continued rise. 
Here, however, human cities are shown to burgeon.  At the base of the pane,
a region of blackened glass hints at a new threat.

sixth~
This pane is difficult to resolve at first, as the coloured glass is all
black, deep blue and darkest purple.  It is soon clear that it represents
the War of Night, as the shadowy shuddeni forces and their unspeakable demon
allies look ready to overwhelm the meagre forces of light, which seem to
cluster meekly in a bottom corner of the window.

The seventh window seems to represent the modern age.  The scene shows a

The large, circular window, which sits high up on the southern wall, is a
complex, abstract work.  It depicts a series of multi-coloured spheres,
connected by shimmering arcs and circles.  One of the larger of these
spheres, made from opallescent greens and blues, is connected to two smaller
spheres nearby - one silver and one red.  In the center of the window is a
circle of gleaming, translucent gold.

E
pillars~
The high pillars which girdle the walls are carved from solid Brintor
granite.  Each is scored with smooth, vertical grooves, which merge with the
highly ornate floral capitals high above.  These then blend with the stone
of the arches forming the vaulted ceiling.

E
arches~
Arches leap from the fluted pillars, forming the two great vaults of the
high ceiling.  From the apex of each vault hang huge iron chandeliers,
bearing dozens of dead candles, their melted wax smothering the ironwork.

Three solid-looking doors greet the northern end of this dank, mouldy

A Young Lady\@s Bedchamber~
This bedchamber once belonged to a young lady - apparent from the
canopied, lace-trimmed, single bed and the ornately-carved vanity unit
against the northern wall.  Opposite these, a large fireplace stands framed
by a singed, wooden mantlepiece which holds some interesting odds and ends. 
Next to this looms a large, redwood wardrobe.  The pastel shades of the
walls are now faded and flaking, and the rich fabrics which adorn the bed
and the eastern window are moth-eaten and frayed.  The luxurious carpet is
soiled with soot.  

A single door leads to the west.

The area just in front of the hearth is thoroughly smeared with ash and

The Balcony Over the Entrance Hall~
A wide balcony overlooks the ruins of the entrance hall, some twenty feet
below. Beyond the loose ceiling beams, some of which hang down almost to
this level, large, arched windows gape out at the surrounding forest, their
once-intricate stained-glass faces now lying shattered on the ground below. 
The floor of the balcony itself is nearly rotted through in many places, and
creaks disturbingly with every step.  

The balcony extends half way around the southern part of the chamber, ending
to the east in a gaping hole, where the wooden staircase has collapsed, and
to the west where a door is set into the wall, facing a broken ballustrade. 
Another door is set in the center of the southern wall.

The Master Bedroom~
Apart for the profusion of clocks of different varieties, hung from every
wall space, this room is relatively simply and tastefully appointed.  An
antique double bed dominates the center of the room, by which stands a small
sidetable, bearing a small, silver-framed portrait, a complex-looking metal
box, and, of course, another clock.  The only other piece of furniture is
the dusty wardrobe standing against the southern wall, and in the opposite
wall is a small, cold fireplace.  The mouldering moisture of the passageway
seems to have spared this room.  Instead the air is dry and tense, and seems
to vibrate with the perfectly synchronised ticking of the many clocks.  

One doorway exits to the east, and another, smaller, service doorway is set
in the south wall.

portrait~
A small, silver framed portrait depicts an elegant woman in her middle
years.  Long, golden hair, just turning grey at the temples, frames her
feminine face, and eyes of clear, shining blue look our from the painting. 
The woman bears herself with the attractive, self-confident dignity of
someone contented with their lot in life - an impression which is
accentuated by the warm smile which graces her lips.  One of the woman\@s
hands is held lightly to her chest, as though to show off the elegant golden
ring - presumably a wedding band - which rests on her finger.  The painting
itself looks somewhat old, at least several decades, from the hairline
cracks which riddle the paint.

This sparcely appointed chamber was clearly a servant\@s quarters of some
sort.  A simple wooden bed stands against the southern wall beneath a small

The Clockmaker\@s Workroom~
Silence greets you as you enter this circular chamber - not the ticking
of a single clock breaks the utter stillness.  However this chamber holds
the most fantastical array of clockwork marvels yet seen.  Impossibly
intricate clocks crowd the workbenches and walls, jostling lathes, mills,
racks of clockmaker\@s tools, alongside tools for carpentry and glassblowing
and metal-smithing.  Even a tiny smelting oven squats in one corner. 
Partially assembled toys, and the metallic limbs, heads, cog-driven innards,
and even a few complete mechanical beasts lie scattered about.  Yet not a
single cog turns, nor do any clockhands tick.  A palpable inertia thickens
the air.  

The room may be exited to the east through the bookcase, or via a stairway,
which curves upward with the eastern wall.

clocks~
Some of the half-finished clocks in this room are highly experimental. 
There are clocks which tell time through the flow of mercury through an

delicately-counterweighted flywheels, which are now completely still; clocks
which operate, somehow, through the refraction of light by a series of
prisms and lenses, which are all now dark.  

One of the larger pieces appears to be a model of a celestial system - an
orrery, representing Avendar and its companion worlds orbiting a sun which
is afixed to a small pillar of intricate clockwork.  Attached to this piece
are several scraps of paper; apparently experimental notes.

across the workbenches, and form a few piles on the floor.  A few completed
creatures stand amongst them, all crafted with loving detail.  

Some of the half-finished clocks in this room are highly experimental. 
There are clocks which tell time through the flow of mercury through an
series of glass chambers; clocks powered by a complex array of
delicately-counterweighted flywheels, which are now completely still; clocks
which operate, somehow, through the refraction of light by a series of
prisms and lenses, which are all now dark.  

One of the larger pieces appears to be a model of a celestial system - an
orrery, representing Avendar and its companion worlds orbiting a sun which
is afixed to a small pillar of intricate clockwork.  Attached to this piece
are several scraps of paper; apparently experimental notes.

The High Tower Room~
The large windows of this top-most tower room look out over the vast
Forest of Nendor, its green canopy swaying and rustling in the wind.  Within
the chamber all is silent.  The rounded walls, which here are set with a
ring of heavy arches to found the battlements above, show no sign of age or
decay.  Framed by one of these arches stands an antique grandfather clock,
frozen in stasis with the rest of the tower.  The center of the chamber is
dominated by a bier, covered in a sheet of white silk.  

A stone stairway leads down, curving with the western wall, and a wooden
ladder leads up to a heavy, oaken trapdoor in the ceiling.

The Tower Battlements~
The bluestone battlements of the tower rise high above the forest\@s
canopy, which extends in all directions, rippling in the cool wind.  A ring
of square merlons shields this space, slotted with crenellations to allow
for bow-fire.  However few targets present themselves to any defending
archer, the thickly-foliaged trees blocking all view of the ground.  The
only creatures visible are the many birds, which dart from tree to tree and
fly in the sky above.  

In the very center of the circular floor a long, brass spyglass has been
fixed atop an iron tripod.  Next to it, a heavy, oaken trapdoor is set into
the stone.

spyglassnorthxx~
Focusing the spyglass on the cobbled streets of the city to the north,
your eye is caught by its vibrant activity.  The walled city of Var Bandor
sits where the Dantaron and Aragol rivers meet, and the Arien and Forest
roads make it an important hub of commerce.  Travellers of all types can be
seen in the streets, as well as vendors and merchants, and locals going
about their daily business.  

In the north of the city sprawl the slums - once an old and distinguished
part of town, it has been taken over by more nefarious elements, and its
dark, twisting lanes look quite unsafe.  A broad avenue divides the northern
and southern parts of town.  The avenue is lined with inns, and at its
center opens a broad square, paved with flagstones, and dominated by a large
marble water fountain.  Merchants and travellers throng the busy square.  

To the south of the square the city is divided, east and west.  In the
southeast stand many tall towers - fantastically designed, and built in
multi-hued stone.  Along the twisting streets of the Scholars\@ Quarter walk
figuresclad in magnificent, if sometimes absurd robes.  The southwest of the
city is dominated by several elegant mansions.  At street level, the cobbled
ways are lines with the shops of fine craftsmen and sellers of fine foods. 


Beyond the northern gate of the city, the pale ribbon of the Arien Road
stretches toward Earendam in the east.  Northward, however, the aperture of
the spyglass skims across countless leagues of brown prairy; the vast Arien
Plains, which march all the way to the forested foothills of the Brintor
Mountains in the distant north.  
~
E
north~
The stone towers and ochre roof-tops of Var Bandor can be seen a short
distance to the north, rising like an stone island in the vast surrounding
wilderness.  The city is perched on the end of a wide peninsula, formed
where the Dantaron and Aragol rivers meet, before flowing away toward
Earendam in the far northwest, through a furtile river valley.  Further
north, the Arien Plains stretch away to the horizon.  

Nendor begins to thin out as its long northward march approaches Var Bandor,
and the green and russet waves of the great forest break upon the city\@s
high, stone walls.  
~
E
west~
Westward the forest ends after a few leagues, where a broad, ashen plain
begins.  The sickly hue of that wide, utterly flat plain extends until it
meets the dim, blue serration of mountains on the very horizon.  The faint,
silvery-blue ribbon of the Dantaron River can be seen threading its way
across the plain.  
~
E
east~
To the east the forest extends for some leagues before giving way to
brown, rolling hills, studded here and there with small coppices.  These
hills rise gradually as they march southward, until they reach the great
spurs of high Mount Enrien, in the far southeast.  
~
E
south~
A sea of green flows away to the south - the waving, rippling canopy of
the great Forest of Nendor.  The forest seems endless in that direction,
save perhaps for a vague hint of golden-brown on the far horizon.  In the
distant southeast, a single peak rises above the forest, into the clouds -
lofty Mount Enrien, mythical home of the Spirit Palace.  
~
E
spyglasssouthxx~
The first thing you notice as you turn the spyglass southward is a small
cottage, nestled amongst the blackberry and privet, just a little way from
the manor itself.  It appears to be a caretaker\@s cottage, and judging from
the spire of smoke rising from its chimney, is still occupied.  The path to
the cottage looks completely overgrown, although perhaps some passage might
still be found through the thick privet shrubs.  

Beyond the grounds of the manor, the Forest of Nendor seems to stretch on
forever.  The circular window of the spyglass skims across countless miles
of this undulating, multi-hued treescape.  Few features are visible beneath
the high, thick canopy of the forest.  Thin streamers of rising smoke,
perhaps from some small village, are visible to the southwest, and some way
beyond that is a dark, twisted-looking section of forest.  Even further
south a wide circle of standing stones can be glimpsed between the trees,
clearly a shrine or holy place of some sort.  Further to the west, a series
of hills rise from the forest, thrust out from the foothills of Mount Enrien
to the far southeast.  

As you scan further and further south, eventually the forest reaches its
end, giving way to a wide, brown savanna.  The thin ribbon of the road can
be seen where it leaves the forest, winding its way across the savanna on
its way to the desert city of Ashta Harrud, far beyond the horizon.  
~
E
spyglasswestxx~
A thick forest of oak stretches a little way to the west.  You can see
the slight break where the Forest Road makes its way north to Var Bandor,
and beyond that a few signs of human endeavour.  A wide glade opens just
beyond the road, in which several people clad in greens and browns seem to
be training.  Further on, a triangular-roofed stone building peeks out from
above the canopy.  Yet further west, small tributaries of the Dantaron River
run through the forest, giving rise to a wood of vibrantly green, lush
trees.  And there, where the forest ends on the banks of the Dantaron, a
busy encampment of trappers can be seen.  

The Dantaron itself winds back northeastward from this point towards Var
Bandor, while further west it skirts the northern edge of a wide,
evil-looking fen country and the southern edge of a grey, ashen plain. 
Eventually the glimmering river fades into the haze of distance.  From that
haze, on the very horizon, rise the jagged Yargash Mountains, where, as the
stories would tell, Rahh-Nefor of the Nefortu burrows into the deepest
caverns.  
~
E
spyglasseastxx~
A forest of oak gradually rises to the east, thickly lining the rolling
hills in that direction.  The forest gives way long before the hills do, and
the sparsely-vegetated ridges stretch for many miles.  Eventually even these
drop away, leaving nothing but a vast, shimmering grassland which stretches
to the eastern horizon.  
~
E
spyglasssouthwestxx~
A little way to the southwest, the dry, oaken forest which surrounds the
manor drops into a shallow bowl.  Here, streams have collected to form a
wide, still pool, surrounded by a murky wetlands.  A small, raised patch
seems to be free of the swampy ground on the west side of the pond, and here
an tiny, overgrown graveyard is situated.  

Beyond this depression, the land rises once more towards the road, and then
past a small village, apparent from the thin streams of smoke which rise
above the forest canopy.  Further still, the forest gives way once more to a
far more extensive wetlands - the infamous Fens of Juk\@Euile, supposedly
home to all manner of fell beast.  
~
E
spyglassnorthwestxx~
The forest ends at the banks of the Dantaron river.  Beyond the opposite
banks stretches a vast, ashen-grey wasteland - the dread Plains of Shargob. 
Their dusty expanse is completely featureless, save for the pale road which
meanders across their middle, coming to its end at the brooding Plateau of
Gogoth in the far west.  The Plains find their northern border at a rim of
green - the Qilarn Forest, ancestral home of the Ethron people.  
~
E
spyglassnortheastxx~
After a few miles to the northeast, the Nendor Forest halts abruptly,
stemmed by the farmlands surrounding Var Bandor.  Crossing the Aragol River,
your gaze passes into the fertile Lithling Valley, which extends the entire
length of the Dantaron between Var Bandor and Earendam the Great.  At the
very limit of your vision you can see a glint of gold on the horizon - the
magnificent Dome of the Sun, atop the Tower of Aramril of the Champions of
Avendar, a few short miles westward of Earendam itself.  
~
E
spyglasssoutheastxx~
Just in the grounds of the manor, to the southeast, stands a dilapidated
old carriage house.  A short stretch of woods separates it from a
caretaker\@s cottage further south.  

Much further southeast, the land rises into a hilly country, at first
covered in forest, but soon bare and brown.  Low ridgetops roll away to the
east, and extend like great, long fingers toward lofty Mount Enrien, with
its head forever in the clouds, to the southeast.  Beyond the forest, the
hills look quite unsavoury.  The dark valleys between the bare ridgetops are
impossible to probe from this vantage, and rumour tells of desperate bandit
lords who make their lairs in the caves beneath those hills.  
~
E
spyglass~
This long spyglass is made from a single, tapering tube of shiny brass,
with an eyepiece at one end and a thick lens at the other.  The device is
attached to a large iron tripod in the center of the battlement floor, on a
hinge which allows it to be pointed in any direction.

The Ballroom~
A grand hall stretches before you, its bluestone walls rising to a high,
arched ceiling.  Fluted pillars line the longer east and west walls, rising
to support lofty ceiling arches.  High on the walls, between the pillars,
are set narrow windows of stained glass.  A much larger circular window
graces the southern wall, its coloured face depicting a complex system of
celestial spheres.  A muted, multi-hued light shines through these windows,
illuminating the rotting wooden floor.  

To the north stands a set of double doors, and above these doors stretches a
narrow, partially-collapsed balcony, accessible by a spiralling staircase of
wrought iron.

A narrow balcony occupies a short stretch of the northern wall.  It was

~
E
windows~
There are eight smaller windows in total, one between each pair of
pillars.  Their coloured panes portray the span of Avendarian history.  You
may look at the first through to the eighth, or you may look at the large,
circular window.  
~
E
first~
The first window depicts the height of ancient alatharya civilization,
with their pyramids and mightly floating cities.  The alatharya figures
depicted are almost god-like in their nobility.  
~
E
second~
The second window clearly represents the Sundering.  A circle of
distressed alatharya surround a pyramid in the center of the window, while
the rest of the window is rent into four segments with jagged lead borders. 
Each of these segments is patterned to represent one of the four elements -
earth, air, fire and water.  
~
E
third~
The third panel depicts the slow rebirth of civilization after the
Sundering.  The great aelin cities, salvaged from the ruins of the alatharya
cities, occupy the upper region of the window, well separated from the races
struggling on the surface of Avendar.  
~
E
fourth~
Wavy red sections of glass make up most of this window, superimposed atop
a horrific vision of the world during the war of fire.  Cities burn, while
green figures of srryn rampage across the pane.  
~
E
fifth~
Again, this window shows civilization\@s recovery and continued rise. 
Here, however, human cities are shown to burgeon.  At the base of the pane,
a region of blackened glass hints at a new threat.  
~
E
sixth~
This pane is difficult to resolve at first, as the coloured glass is all
black, deep blue and darkest purple.  It is soon clear that it represents
the War of Night, as the shadowy shuddeni forces and their unspeakable demon
allies look ready to overwhelm the meagre forces of light, which seem to
cluster meekly in a bottom corner of the window.  
~
E
seventh~
The seventh window seems to represent the modern age.  The scene shows a
motley collection of mortal races, set against an abstract, composite
landscape.  
~
E
eighth~
The last window is completely blank - made from a single pane of clear
glass.  
~
E

The large, circular window, which sits high up on the southern wall, is a

connected by shimmering arcs and circles.  One of the larger of these

spheres nearby - one silver and one red.  In the center of the window is a

Upon Marshy Ground~
The puddles and streams of this miniature swamp are fed from the north,
where a spring-fed fountain gushes into a trickling stream.  The waters
spread out to cover much of the ground here, creating a muddy area, studded
with deep, murky puddles.  Only a few spindley gorse bushes grow from the
sodden ground, their small, yellow flowers doing little to liven the area. 

The puddles are fed from a broken fountain to the north, which burbles
between the western forest and the looming mansion to the northeast.  To the

This wide patio area is paved with granite flagstones, which form a

fed by a natural spring, because it gushes steadily with cool, clear water. 
The bowl of the fountain is cracked, and the whole structure stands
lopsided, spilling the flow southward across the patio.  Surrounding the
fountain are a few stone benches, and looming over the whole area are the
great stone arches which support the high eastern wall.

mechanical devices - metallic frames crammed with cogs, levers and gears. 
Most seem to be broken, their former functions indecipherable.  

A single door leads to the west, to the main part of the cottage.

Inside an Old Carriage~
The dusty interior of this once-grand carriage is somewhat stifling.  The
decaying upholstery of the two facing benches has filled the compartment
with a cloud of fibres, suggesting that its doors have not been opened in
years.  The benches were once covered in luxurious red velvet, which is now
faded and tattered.  Intricate moldings line the windows and the frame of
the door, suggesting its former owner was a person of some wealth.  An upper
corner of the carriage is occupied by a thick, white spider web.  A windowed
door leads from both sides of the carriage.

A Clearing Before a Small Cottage~
A grassy clearing opens between the privet to the north and west, and the
dense forest to the south, forming a small front lawn for the little cottage
to the east.  The cottage looks quite dilapidated, with boards missing from
the walls, and large sections of terracotta tiles missing from the roof.  A
narrow porch, bordered by a carved wooden railing, extends from the front of
the cottage, in the center of which is set a faded door.  A tunnel through

A Well-Stocked Cellar~
This room seems to be intact - defiled neither by the destruction of the
kitchen above, or by the depredations of beasts and looters.  It has also
remained dry, by virtue of the carefully-tiled slate walls.  Several barrels
line the walls of the windowless chamber, as do bags of grain and meal.  A
row of shelves on the southern wall holds some large, clay tubs, sealed with

A Rutted Carriageway ~
The carriageway runs past another partially-collapsed section of the
building here.  The lower floor still stands, but the upper has crumbled to
ruin.  Nothing remains of the walls above but a few jutting fingers of
stone, silhouetted against the sky.  Amongst the stones perches a leering
gargoyle, its form horribly reptillian.  A stream of water trickles along
one of the ruts in the ground, flowing from north to south.  To the south
the path soon comes to an end, by the wide doors of an old carriage house.

A large pond spreads between the forested banks, fed by a little stream

plunging into the water.  The trees grow densely, and overhang the pond,
blocking almost all view of the sky.  The water is still for the most part,

A Small Graveyard~
An old graveyard is nestled within the dark woods here, and screened from
the eastern pond by a high growth of reeds.  Barely twenty feet wide, it
holds only a handful of sunken graves, all heavily overgrown with creeping
weeds.  Towards the edge of the forest, a single grave lies open, seemingly
dug long ago but never filled.  In the very center of the graveyard stands a
stone sundial, its raised gnomon useless beneath the shadow of the
overhanging canopy.

The Chamber of the Chronometer~
This circular, stone chamber is filled with a timekeeping device of
unsurpassed intricacy - an exquisite orrery, in which a minature, bronze
Avendar is surrounded by its celestial companions, all in perfect scale,
spinning, orbitting and precessing in their allotted paths.  The immense
astrolabe surrounds a tall pillar of complex machinery - a clockwork
structure replete with thousands of cogs, gears, levers and chains, all
whirring and spinning in unison.  Five shining clocks project from the
apparatus, marked with unfamiliar glyphs and sigils, each ticking away their
own obscure measures of time.  The tripod legs of the pillar stand astride a
hole in the floor, through which a huge pendulum hangs, its ponderous
oscillation driving the entire device.  

A stone staircase curves upward with the western wall to a hatch in the
ceiling, and an open trapdoor leads through the floor.

orrery~
The device is, at first, highly confusing to look upon, and its daunting
complexity eludes comprehension.  With further analysis.  However, the
magnificent symmetries reveal themselves.  The intricate orrery is a perfect
model of Avendar\@s celestial system.  Mounted on great brass wheels, driven
by a clockwork pillar, each planet, moon, ring and shell in the system is
represented in perfect, minature scale, each orbitting the spinning golden
orb of the sun at the center.  

Avendar itself is cast in bronze, and inset with lapis lazuli oceans.  Metal
struts extend from the planet, supporting the twin moons - Lunus of shining
silver, and Rhos of ruddy brass.  Two planets, of dull tin and green-tinted
copper, are set closer to the sun, while three huge planets of jade, pewter
and iron, each girdled by rings and moons, hang, stationary, farther out. 
Beyond the planets, five concentric brass rings girdle the entire system,
each marked with indecipherable runic scales, near the walls of the chamber,
and each set at a different angle about the plane of the planets.  

The brass rings rotate about their own axes, but also precess slowly,
mapping out incomprehensible swathes of time -- perhaps defining the very
ages of Avendar.

by the clockwork, and to these are attached the struts supporting the
orbitting celestial bodies of the orrery.  Each of the five main clocks
extending from the Chronometer\@s pillar bears an ivory face, with strange
astrological symbols done in mother-of-pearl.  Each clock face bears two
obsidian-black hands - each moving at a different rate, either backwards or
forwards.  Dozens of smaller clocks are also set deeper into the mechanism,
mapping out more familiar time scales; from seconds to decades.  An

The Clockmaker\@s Workshop~
A cacophany of sound greets you as you enter this circular chamber. 
Hundreds of clocks tick in discord, and a fantastical array of
half-completed clockwork marvels whir, buzz and lurch in an abortive frenzy.
The impossibly intricate devices crowd the workbenches and walls, jostling
lathes, mills, racks of clockmaker\@s tools, alongside tools for carpentry
and glassblowing and metal-smithing.  Even a tiny smelting oven squats in
one corner.  

The room may be exited to the east through the bookcase, or via a stairway,
which curves upward with the eastern wall.

marvels~
The unfinished parts of a number of mechanical beasts are scattered
across the workbenches, all writhing and twisting madly.  A number of
completed creatures also race about, in a somewhat more coordinated fashion.

The many clocks in this room tick in discord, resulting in an
almost-unbearable din.  Some of these pieces are quite remarkable: one, for
example, operates through the slow trickle of mercury through a series of
glass chambers and tubes, which hang from complex, bimetallic scales;
another clock consists of an array of delicately-counterweighted flywheels,
which remain completely inert for several seconds, before simultaneously
rotating into a new configuration; and yet another clock seems to refract a
bright beam of light through a circle of lenses and prisms, somehow driving
a flywheel in the center.  

A beautiful orrery, the perfect replica of the Chronometer, yet only a foot
in height, keeps perfect time with its sister-piece.

The High Tower Room~
The large windows of this top-most tower room look out over the vast
Forest of Nendor, its green canopy swaying and rustling in the wind.  Within
the chamber all is silent.  The rounded walls, which here are set with a
ring of heavy arches to found the battlements above, show no sign of age or
decay.  Framed by one of these arches stands an antique grandfather clock,
which ticks loudly as its pendulum swings out the seconds.  The center of
the chamber is dominated by a bier, covered in a sheet of white silk.  

A stone stairway leads down, curving with the western wall, and a wooden
ladder leads up to a heavy, oaken trapdoor in the ceiling.

The Tower Battlements~
The bluestone battlements of the tower rise high above the forest\@s
canopy, which extends in all directions, rippling in the cool wind.  A ring
of square merlons shields this space, slotted with crenellations to allow
for bow-fire.  However few targets present themselves to any defending
archer, the thickly-foliaged trees blocking all view of the ground.  The
only creatures visible are the many birds, which dart from tree to tree and
fly in the sky above.  

In the very center of the circular floor a long, brass spyglass has been
fixed atop an iron tripod.  Next to it, a heavy, oaken trapdoor is set into
the stone.

Just in the grounds of the manor, to the southeast, stands a dilapidated
old carriage house.  A short stretch of woods separates it from a
caretaker\@s cottage further south.  

Much further southeast, the land rises into a hilly country, at first
covered in forest, but soon bare and brown.  Low ridgetops roll away to the
east, and extend like great, long fingers toward lofty Mount Enrien, with
its head forever in the clouds, to the southeast.  Beyond the forest, the
hills look quite unsavoury.  The dark valleys between the bare ridgetops are
impossible to probe from this vantage, and rumour tells of desperate bandit
lords who make their lairs in the caves beneath those hills.  
~
E
spyglassnortheastxx~
After a few miles to the northeast, the Nendor Forest halts abruptly,
stemmed by the farmlands surrounding Var Bandor.  Crossing the Aragol River,
your gaze passes into the fertile Lithling Valley, which extends the entire
length of the Dantaron between Var Bandor and Earendam the Great.  At the
very limit of your vision you can see a glint of gold on the horizon - the
magnificent Dome of the Sun, atop the Tower of Aramril of the Champions of
Avendar, a few short miles westward of Earendam itself.  
~
E
spyglassnorthwestxx~
The forest ends at the banks of the Dantaron river.  Beyond the opposite
banks stretches a vast, ashen-grey wasteland - the dread Plains of Shargob. 
Their dusty expanse is completely featureless, save for the pale road which
meanders across their middle, coming to its end at the brooding Plateau of
Gogoth in the far west.  The Plains find their northern border at a rim of
green - the Qilarn Forest, ancestral home of the Ethron people.  
~
E
spyglasssouthwestxx~
A little way to the southwest, the dry, oaken forest which surrounds the
manor drops into a shallow bowl.  Here, streams have collected to form a
wide, still pool, surrounded by a murky wetlands.  A small, raised patch
seems to be free of the swampy ground on the west side of the pond, and here
an tiny, overgrown graveyard is situated.  

Beyond this depression, the land rises once more towards the road, and then
past a small village, apparent from the thin streams of smoke which rise
above the forest canopy.  Further still, the forest gives way once more to a
far more extensive wetlands - the infamous Fens of Juk\@Euile, supposedly
home to all manner of fell beast.  
~
E
spyglasseastxx~
A forest of oak gradually rises to the east, thickly lining the rolling
hills in that direction.  The forest gives way long before the hills do, and
the sparsely-vegetated ridges stretch for many miles.  Eventually even these
drop away, leaving nothing but a vast, shimmering grassland which stretches
to the eastern horizon.  
~
E
spyglasswestxx~
A thick forest of oak stretches a little way to the west.  You can see
the slight break where the Forest Road makes its way north to Var Bandor,
and beyond that a few signs of human endeavour.  A wide glade opens just
beyond the road, in which several people clad in greens and browns seem to
be training.  Further on, a triangular-roofed stone building peeks out from
above the canopy.  Yet further west, small tributaries of the Dantaron River
run through the forest, giving rise to a wood of vibrantly green, lush
trees.  And there, where the forest ends on the banks of the Dantaron, a
busy encampment of trappers can be seen.  

The Dantaron itself winds back northeastward from this point towards Var
Bandor, while further west it skirts the northern edge of a wide,
evil-looking fen country and the southern edge of a grey, ashen plain. 
Eventually the glimmering river fades into the haze of distance.  From that
haze, on the very horizon, rise the jagged Yargash Mountains, where, as the
stories would tell, Rahh-Nefor of the Nefortu burrows into the deepest
caverns.  
~
E
spyglasssouthxx~
The first thing you notice as you turn the spyglass southward is a small
cottage, nestled amongst the blackberry and privet, just a little way from
the manor itself.  It appears to be a caretaker\@s cottage, and judging from
the spire of smoke rising from its chimney, is still occupied.  The path to
the cottage looks completely overgrown, although perhaps some passage might
still be found through the thick privet shrubs.  

Beyond the grounds of the manor, the Forest of Nendor seems to stretch on
forever.  The circular window of the spyglass skims across countless miles
of this undulating, multi-hued treescape.  Few features are visible beneath
the high, thick canopy of the forest.  Thin streamers of rising smoke,
perhaps from some small village, are visible to the southwest, and some way
beyond that is a dark, twisted-looking section of forest.  Even further
south a wide circle of standing stones can be glimpsed between the trees,
clearly a shrine or holy place of some sort.  Further to the west, a series
of hills rise from the forest, thrust out from the foothills of Mount Enrien
to the far southeast.  

As you scan further and further south, eventually the forest reaches its
end, giving way to a wide, brown savanna.  The thin ribbon of the road can
be seen where it leaves the forest, winding its way across the savanna on
its way to the desert city of Ashta Harrud, far beyond the horizon.  
~
E
spyglassnorthxx~
Focusing the spyglass on the cobbled streets of the city to the north,
your eye is caught by its vibrant activity.  The walled city of Var Bandor
sits where the Dantaron and Aragol rivers meet, and the Arien and Forest
roads make it an important hub of commerce.  Travellers of all types can be
seen in the streets, as well as vendors and merchants, and locals going
about their daily business.  

In the north of the city sprawl the slums - once an old and distinguished
part of town, it has been taken over by more nefarious elements, and its
dark, twisting lanes look quite unsafe.  A broad avenue divides the northern
and southern parts of town.  The avenue is lined with inns, and at its
center opens a broad square, paved with flagstones, and dominated by a large
marble water fountain.  Merchants and travellers throng the busy square.  

To the south of the square the city is divided, east and west.  In the
southeast stand many tall towers - fantastically designed, and built in
multi-hued stone.  Along the twisting streets of the Scholars\@ Quarter walk
figuresclad in magnificent, if sometimes absurd robes.  The southwest of the
city is dominated by several elegant mansions.  At street level, the cobbled
ways are lines with the shops of fine craftsmen and sellers of fine foods. 


Beyond the northern gate of the city, the pale ribbon of the Arien Road
stretches toward Earendam in the east.  Northward, however, the aperture of
the spyglass skims across countless leagues of brown prairy; the vast Arien
Plains, which march all the way to the forested foothills of the Brintor
Mountains in the distant north.  
~
E
n~
The stone towers and ochre roof-tops of Var Bandor can be seen a short
distance to the north, rising like an stone island in the vast surrounding
wilderness.  The city is perched on the end of a wide peninsula, formed
where the Dantaron and Aragol rivers meet, before flowing away toward
Earendam in the far northwest, through a furtile river valley.  Further
north, the Arien Plains stretch away to the horizon.  

Nendor begins to thin out as its long northward march approaches Var Bandor,
and the green and russet waves of the great forest break upon the city\@s
high, stone walls.

A magnificent oak tree spreads its limbs over this part of the garden,

up the lower parts of the oak\@s trunk.  However a new invader is beginning
to drive back the ivy - thick growths of blackberry rise in an impenetrable

Beneath the Willow Tree~
A large willow tree leans over the sodden ground, sprinkling the puddles
and rivulets with slender green leaves.  The canopy formed by the long,
sinuous branches of the willow comes almost to the ground, creating a
shielded, almost peaceful space.  Several birds hop about the marshy ground,
hunting for food in the mud.  The marsh continues to the north, while to the

A Silent Pond~
The still waters of this murky pond spread beneath the overhanging boughs
of the forest.  The banks here are thick with slender reeds, which grow down
into the muddy shallows of the pond.  Their long stalks sway gently in the
faint breezes from the forest, filling the air with a susurrant rattle. 
Occasionally a swirling current will come from the deeper parts of the pond,
as though something were moving in its depths.  

The pond continues to the north, while to the east the low, reed-clad bank
of the pond may be climbed.

In the Branches of an Old Oak Tree~
The heavy boughs of this old oak stretch outward from a common point at
the top of the trunk, forming a comfortable perch in the middle.  The tree
is quite tall, and a view of much of the garden can be had from here.  You
can even see beyond the blackberry bushes to the south, where a small,
wooden structure stands, a stream of smoke wafting from its chimney.  A
large nest of woven twigs sits between a pair of forking limbs higher up.

tree limb to the roof of the carriage house.

of the pond, an area of deepest shadow lies, unbreachable by even the

Looming above you to the south is an old, stone mansion.  The building is
two stories high, with a tall bluestone tower set into the northwestern

blending the building with the surrounding forest.  Only a few patches of
lichen-ridden stone look out from the ivy, and shattered windows high
overhead peer blankly at the tree-tops.  The carriageway, which leads north

Once splendidly appointed, this large entrance chamber is now in a state

precariously from their sockets, now forming perches for the birds of the
forest, which come and go through the broken stained-glass windows. 
Girdling the southern half of the room is a wide balcony -- now unreachable,
as its wooden staircase has long since collapsed, blocking a door in the
eastern wall.  Several clocks, of different shapes and sizes, hang from the
plaster walls about the chamber, or lie toppled in the debris of the floor. 

Double doors are set in both the north and south walls, while in the western
wall the door has fallen from its hinges, and a faint, tinkling music comes

intricately molded parade of metal figures, designed to circle about,
tolling their bells at the decreed hours.  Some clocks also lie smashed on
the floor, victims of the general decay of the chamber.  Bizarrely, however,

clock~
Several ornate clocks hang from the walls - from cuckoo clocks, to
beautifully carved round pieces, with simple pendulums.  A few tall
grandfather clocks also stand in places.  One such clock bears an
intricately molded parade of metal figures, designed to circle about,
tolling their bells at the decreed hours.  Some clocks also lie smashed on
the floor, victims of the general decay of the chamber.  Bizarrely, however,
those clocks which stand or hang upright are all ticking, and keeping
perfect time.

E
balcony~
A wide balcony extends the length of the south wall, and half way along
the east and west walls, about twenty feet above the ground.  Doors stand in
each of these walls, although the eastern balcony door gapes upon open sky -
the room beyond apparently having have vanished.  The balcony itself looks
to be in a state of immanent collapse.  A large part of the eastern section,
including the stairs, have already done so.  There is now no way up to the
balcony besides flight, or through those upper doors.  
~
E
windows~
A series of large, stained-glass windows breach the northern face of this
room, high above the ground.  Their neo-pious style depicts the usual array
of divine representations, concentrating the the gods of light.  Many
coloured panes are missing from the windows, and their shattered remnants
can be found amongst the rubble on the floor.

A dark, ominous hallway leads north and south from here.  Its panelled

A dark hallway extends north from here, into deep shadow.  Directly to

A Dusty Sitting Room~
The curving wall of the tower cuts through this room to the northwest,
giving it an odd, almost-triangular shape.  It is efficiently furnished as a
comfortable sitting room, with a couple of divans and a single armchair
arranged about the walls, all covered in dusty white sheets.  Against the
narrow segment of the northern wall, in the nook formed between the tower
and the eastern wall, is set a beautiful, gilded harpsichord.  A tinkling
music streams from the instrument, and its keys depress and rise again, as
though at the hands of an invisible musician.  

An open doorway leads to a large chamber to the east, and a closed doorway
to the south.

The Chamber of the Chronometer~
This circular, stone chamber is filled with a timekeeping device of
unsurpassed intricacy - an exquisite orrery, in which a minature, bronze
Avendar is surrounded by its celestial companions, all in perfect scale. 
The immense astrolabe surrounds a high pillar of complex machinery - a
clockwork structure replete with thousands of cogs, gears, levers and
chains.  Five shining clocks project from the apparatus, marked with
unfamiliar glyphs and sigils.  The tripod legs of the pillar stand astride a
hole in the floor, through which a huge pendulum hangs into the chamber
below.  However, the entire orrery is still.  No cog turns, the clocks are
silent, and the pendulum hangs motionless.  The planets, moons and sun are
suspended as though frozen in an instant in time.  

A stone staircase curves upward with the western wall to a hatch in the
ceiling, and a heavy trapdoor of green-tinted metal is set into the floor.

pillar~
The clockwork pillar rises from the center of the chamber, an iron
framework bearing a timekeeping device of amazing complexity.  The thousands
of motionless cogs and gears are all locked together with mechanical
precision.  Several heavy brass wheels, set at different angles, are
designed to be driven by the clockwork, and to these are attached the struts
supporting the celestial bodies of the orrery.  Five main clocks extend from
the apparatus, marked with obscure glyphs and sigils, while set deeper into
the mechanism are dozens of smaller clocks, measuring more familiar
timescales; from seconds to decades.  

The entire structure is still, and the great pendulum, which hangs through a
hole in the floor to the chamber below, is motionless.

orrery~
The device is, at first, highly confusing to look upon, and its daunting
complexity eludes comprehension.  With further analysis. however, the
magnificent symmetries reveal themselves.  The intricate orrery is a perfect
model of Avendar\@s celestial system.  Mounted on great brass wheels, driven
by a clockwork pillar, each planet, moon, ring and shell in the system is
represented in perfect, minature scale, all frozen in orbit with each other, 
and about the golden orb of the sun at the center.  

Avendar itself is cast in bronze, and inset with lapis lazuli oceans.  Metal
struts extend from the planet, supporting the twin moons - Lunus of shining
silver, and Rhos of ruddy brass.  Two planets, of dull tin and green-tinted
copper, are set closer to the sun, while three huge planets of jade, pewter
and iron, each girdled by rings and moons, hang, stationary, farther out. 
Beyond the planets, five concentric brass rings girdle the entire system,
each marked with indecipherable runic scales, near the walls of the chamber, 
and each set at a different angle about the plane of the planets.

Amongst the Blackberries~
Movement is almost impossible through the middle of this blackberry
thicket.  Barbs catch your skin and tear your clothing with every motion. 
Through use of brute force alone, a meagre path can be cut, although to the
south and east the blackberries become thicker, and utterly impossible to
traverse.

A Bend in a Rutted Carriageway~
The overgrown carriageway turns south here, travelling down the side of
the old mansion, and to the west, past the mansion\@s front.  In the distance
to the south, beyond the rear of the mansion, can be seen the carriage
house.  Nearer-by, the forest presses in from the east and north, with leafy
boughs leaning over the path.  The mansion, ruined in places, looms to the

A Path Torn Through the Forest~
A wide path has been torn through the forest here, as though by the
passage of some great beast.  Shrubs are rent aside, or simply crushed in
many cases, and low-hanging branches have been ripped from trees.  To the
west, a thick stand of blackberries lies in tatters from the passage.  To
the north is the rear of an old, wooden building, which seems to have been
the origin of the destruction, as a great hole gapes in the wall, and
shattered wood is strewn across the forest floor.  To the south, somewhat
downhill, stands another, larger wooden building.  A similar hole opens in
its northern wall.

A Rutted Carriageway ~
The rutted carriageway passes beneath the ruined eastern side of the
mansion here.  The entire two stories of the building lie toppled in ruin
just to the west, and stones lie scattered across the path, moss-covered and
half-buried in mud.  Further south the mansion is still largely intact,
although the walls are beginning to crumble.  The carriage-way passes
beneath these walls before reaching a smaller, wooden structure in the
distance.  To the east the forest presses thickly against the road.

Here outer walls of the mansion are intact, although covered with patches

with a small, trickling stream running from the eastern road-bank, into one
of the carriage ruts, and southward.  Leafy boughs overhang the path, and a
few thistles grow up from amongst the broken cobblestones.  Some way to the

Before an Old Carriage House~
The overgrown carriageway comes to an end here, at the doors of a wooden
carriage house, just to the south.  The building was once painted red, but
has now faded and flaked to a pinkish-brown.  Many of the tiles of its
triangular roof have slipped, and lie scattered on the ground, and the whole
structure looks slightly lopsided.  A trickling stream of water flows under
the front doors, into the building.  To the west a cobbled footpath begins,
and winds around the side of the carriage house, toward the grounds of the
mansion.

An Old Carriage House~
This simple wooden structure is designed to hold both carriage and
horses, though the two stalls for the latter stand empty.  The carriage
house is all of wood, with an earthen floor, and seems termite ridden and
fragile.  Several wooden tiles from the roof have come loose, leaving large
gaps in some places.  A thin stream of water flows beneath the large, double
doors to the north, through the carriage house, and beneath a furrow under
the southern wall.

Clearly the wall of some great hall, it is lined with high, stained glass
windows, spaced between the buttresses.  The northern wall is lower, its
