The body of the once-famous Master Nayshan has been cruelly cut up,
sagging limply from the many broad-headed iron nails which affix it to the
wall.  The arms and legs are spread-eagled, broken in several places.  Long,
thin strips of skin and muscle dangle from the body, flayed and peeled away.
The shattered jaw hangs open, several smaller viscera cut from elsewhere
placed obscenely within.  The eyes are torn and ragged, bits of the pulpy
tissue hanging from the sockets.

Many years after the War of Night, when the Spirit Palace had become
fairly well established, it was noticed that some strange activity was
happening in the caves of Mount Enrien.  Unsettled by this, as it was
very close to the prison of the demon lord Kzroth, a few scholars were
sent to explore and establish what had happened.

In the mountain they found a group who referred to themselves as "Kohli"
and appeared to be the last remanents of a race which had lived for many
years deep underground.  Observing the kohli while invisible, it was
eventually deduced that some massive, evil creature had forced them from
their homes, and was responsible for their now sparse population.  The
amber dragon, upon hearing the details, realized it was the void dragon
Tzet-Sabanthe.  Knowing the pure corruption and evil that the dark dragon
was, the amber dragon sought it and drove it off, unwilling to allow it
to destroy an entire race.  The kohli, thankful and awestruck, came to
worship the amber dragon as their diety, and elected to stay in their
new city, close to their god.  It was not until sometime later that the
details of this were discovered, however, due to the generally seclusive
nature of the amber dragon.

The Spirit Palace, in all its beauty and glory, has attracted many who
hate it for those it houses.  Between the six magics a balance has always
existed, keeping a peace that is understood by most powerful scholars.
Envy and hate cloud reason, however, and during the rule of the fifth
great Arch-Mage, Gaene Vosatair, dark stirrings were heard.  A group of
void and fire scholars broke from their guilds to create their own sect,
the Maevis'Hra, which loosely translates into "Bringers of Darkness".
Hoping to eliminate the presence of the golden light that is Spirit,
they performed many dark rituals, a twisted meld of pain and darkness.
Believing themselves strong enough to fight this small sect, the many
schools of spirit around Avendar prepared to defend themselves, and those
at the palace settled down for war.

To the spirit scholars, triumph was never in doubt.  The Arch-Mage,
however, had underestimated the Maevis'Hra and their fanatical devotion
to their cause.  The night the Maevis'Hra struck has been burned into
legend as the greatest tragedy ever to befall the scholars of Spirit.
All over Avendar spirit schools were besieged by scholars and their vile
demons.  The guild in Drellan Myr fell early, burned to the ground by
unnatural fires, and not leaving any survivors.  For the Spirit Palace
was saved the darkwalkers strongest ally, the demon lord Kzroth, a being of
fire and destruction.  He cut through the palace defences easily,
feasting on the bodies of those he killed, and growing stronger for each
one.

Knowing the demon must be stopped, or it would most likely succeed in
destroying the palace, Arch-Mage Vosatair went out to fight him alone,
giving his body up to become a true avatar.  By giving all his soul to
his transformation, he became more powerful than any before him, burning
up his own life energy.  The battle between the Arch-Mage and Kzroth was
long, but eventually Kzroth was weakened enough to be trapped.  The
remaining Maevis'Hra fled at his defeat, and Kzroth was locked in a
magically warded cell within the mountain.  When the cell was closed,
the Arch-Mage fell and as the consuming light dissipated, so did he, until
nothing remained of either.

The Spirit Palace was first suggested about a decade after the magics of
air had been let loose upon the land.  Realizing the destructive force
of pure entropy, and the seeming weakening of the barrier between the magic
of air and the prime material in the clouds around the ancient Mountain
Enrien, a young human scholar suggested a place of work and magic be
built nearby.  Not only would this palace serve to watch over the beings
of chaos that roamed this energy-charged place, but it would also be a
symbol of the strength and hope that spirit magic itself represented.
The young man, Heclan Nayber, would become the first Arch-Mage of the
Spirit Palace, and its first leader.  Always wise beyond his years, his
decision was oft proven a good one as time progressed.

This large room is very dark and a musty reek fills the air.  Once a

serves as a makeshift fungus cave.  The windows have been thoroughly sealed
and numerous varieties of pale fungus cover the floor and walls, growing on
the carrion remains of former denziens of the spirit palace.  Cave slugs,
imported from Yithoul, slither about the grim carnage, feeding on the
fallen.  A shallow pool of fetid water sits in the center of the room, the
fungus growing about it.  A single door leads north, back to the main part
