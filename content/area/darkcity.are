Patrolling the city for any disturbances, a kohli guard walks here.
~
The guard is battle-harded and strong, his dark face set as his small
black eyes scan the area.  Fine brown fur covers the boney hand that rests
on his sword, and he seems ready for anything.

The gate guard seems to fit her armor well, her hard bat-like face
angular and firm.  Her wings are folded back, and she stands straight in

A kohli special guard stands here, protecting the Lord and his manor.

The kohli guard stands here, his thin lips pursed as his shiney black
eyes survey you in return.  The fine brown fur covering his body doesn\@t
diguise the muscles on his slight frame, and he seems quite competant. 
Thin, leathery wings fold behind him, and his oddly delicate hands never
waver from his sharp blade.

The high priest nods to you, as all are welcome in the temple of the
dragon.  His long robes flow down, cloaking him entirely, and they pick up
the warm light of the dragon, making the priets himself almost seem glowing.
The wings that are normally present on most kohli are not visible, most
likely hidden in the folds of his robe.  Fine lines marr the wise lightly
furred face of the priest, and his black eyes look worried as he looks away.

Kzroth, the demon lord is here, glaring at you with fury.
~
Kzroth glares at you dark red eyes seeming to glow in contrast to his
scorched charcoal black hide.  His skin is thick and when he moves flakes
fall to the ground, almost as if his skin is atually burning and chipping
off.  He reeks of urine, death and sulphur, making the air hard to breathe. 
In fact, each breath he expels seems to darken and contaminate the
surrounding air.  Massive hands, tipped with long claws that match the
colour of your blood, swing at you, in unthinking rage.

This gargantuan beast is nearly thirty feet in length and nine feet at
the shoulders.  Its angled, stone-like scales are midnight black, razor
sharp, and gleam with a glassy sheen.  Folded against the sides of this
creatures head and neck is a ruff of leathery skin which can be expanded
into a vibrant frill.  A large crest of vertical scales runs from the head
down to its tail where the scales become more like spikes.  Hooked claws
reside at the ends of powerful forelimbs as thick as tree trunks, and dim
orange eyes set deep in narrow sockets shine with a faint luster.  Huge
leathery wings fold seamlessly onto its back when not keeping the beast
aloft and are kept protected beneath a retractable carapace.

chessboard~
Carved of rock and then painted to the appropriate colours, the
chessboard seems sturdy enough to survive the most drunken of players.  The
rock has been roughly carved and shaped into the pieces, little detail added
beyond what was needed to make the distinction between the different
positions.  The only difference is the king of each set, carefully and
intricately done to look like a large dragon, the wings of both painted
amber.

Unholy, Dirty, and Beautiful~
Bound by the time on the clock
Bittersweet wondering the quiet transfusion
Hold tight nothing is complicated
Hold tight everything\@s fine
Confidence fell through the hole in your pocket
The simples illogic so it be logic
I\@m caught in the diaries with all your complaining
The curious scribblings of one who has everything
 
Leave me unholy and dirty and beautiful be
Unholy and dirty and beautiful
 
Cherish the lies that you brought
Charming delusions gone crack in the fire
I know we might be mediocre
I know nothing\@s on fire
Confidence fell through the hole in your pocket
The simples illogic so it be logic
I\@m caught in the diaries with all your complaining
Ridiculous grumblings from one who has everything
 
Leave me unholy and dirty and beautiful be

A Shrine to the Demon~
The room is very dark, the walls, floor, and ceiling painted to an inky
black.  There is a small altar, made from finely polished wood, set up near
the front.  It is ornately designed and covered in depictions of a demon. 
The images show a huge demon being trapped, then some sort of chaos breaking
him free from his prison.  The pictures are vague, with many strange symbols
that you can\@t recognize, but the message is clear; the demon has awoke. 
There is a small ladder leading upwards, and a thick door with a heavy iron
lock on it, leading east.

counter, waiting to be purchased.  At the back, several tools lay in various
stages of completion, but all seeming of the same sort as what is on the
table already.  South, a door leads back to the city, and back to cooler
air.

knicknacks in the room, more than a small inkwell and a pen.  The bed looks
more like a bunk, sticking out of the east wall, looking hard and

A Small Shrine~
A small mural of an amber dragon stares unblinkingly back at you from the

has been constructed, a single candle burning on top of it.  The candle is
surrounded by the ashes, and you can smell the acrid smoke that comes from
burning paper.  Besides a small carpet to lean on, the only other thing in
the room is the exit back east to the priest\@s home.

passes by, the Kohli walking it don\@t even glance your direction.  North the

A Ruined Home~
Most likely due to the shifts in the cavern walls pushing a huge slab of
rock out into the middle of the rubble, this house has not been rebuilt like
the others.  An enterprising young Kohli has converted what is left of the
rubble into a display for some pieces of furniture for people to buy to fill
up their new homes.  To the north lies the main road, through the frame of a
doorway.

calm, and of patience.  To the east, a beautiful shrine is set up, glowing
with the radiance that lights this room.  North, a few candles are lit,
above a wide copper bowl, and the exit back to the road lies to the west.

A large statue sits here, of an amber coloured dragon, wings unfurled,
and standing majestically.  It\@s eyes are two chips of apache\@s tear, and
seem to be deep and all knowing, surveying you and weighing your soul. 
There are some wooden benches infront of the statue.  Polished to a warm
gleam, for the worshippers of this dragon to sit on as they contemplate. 
West lies the main room of the temple, seeming dull and drab in comparison
to the dragon\@s inner light.

anywhere there is a gap, you see fine cracks running through the stone. 
North lies the door to the grand ballroom, and south the door to the dining
room.  The hall continues west, coming to an intersection.

The Ballroom~
You are in a grand ball room, and this is perhaps one of the most
impressive examples of Kohli architecture you have ever seen.  The ceiling
arches high, with murals of a large amber dragon, and different impressive
looking Kohli, most likely ancestors of the Lord.  The sculpted
candleholders are spaced evenly along the walls, each holding a white
candle, the fickering light illuminating the area well enough to see, but
lending soft shadows to the harsh stone.  The beauty of the murals and
carvings along the wall is marred by the pile of stones lying to the north,
cutting off the rest of this majestic room.  Wide double doors lead back
south, to the main hallway.

This room is luxious, compared to most of the other Kohli homes.  The bed
is stone, but with thick blankets to cushion and warm.  A large dresser
takes up half the wall; it seems the lord\@s daughter needs as much in
clothing as the other Kohli need in house space.  A carpet covers the floor,
the colours exactly matching the blankets and tapestries on the walls.  A
lone door leads east, back to the hallway.

Gates to Kohlis~
The city stretches out to the east and south of here, small houses
leaning against each other in hasty construction.  Further east is a tall
manor, the grey stone smooth as it raises up, nearly to the ceiling.  A door
stands open to the north, and from the motifs in the carvings around the
door, you would assume it to be the guard house.  The gates loom to the
west, the tall pillars holding them fading up into the darkness above.

A Cell~
The room is dank and completely bare, nothing to make the hard stone more
comfortable or livable.  The whole place has a feeling of hopelessness, and
the walls seem closer around you than they did when you first stepped in.  A
whole day in a cell like this would probably break most people, couped up in
such a tiny little space with nothing for company but your thoughts, while
the loss of hope sank into your bones.  A small door leads west, with a
heavy iron lock on the door, the only break in the flat continuity of the
wall.

The tunnel bends here, curving east into what appears to be a wall of

The whole room seems heavy with malevolence, as if all the evil in the

of a large hole in the northeastern wall look as if some great force has
smashed through the stone.  Jagged rocks cast bizarre shadows, and seem
scattered as if thrown in anger by some divine hand.  The floor is smooth,
and almost slippery as glass, but marred by deep furrows where large claws
have scratched it.  The doors leading south have dents in them, as though
something has been trying to break through them, and large rents scrape the
stone around the doors.

You gaze at the Mark of the Damned, examining with care the fine lines
and gouges making its form.  Even as you do so, you feel the world about you
waver and fade..  

You find yourself floating within the void, surrounded by nothingness. 
Soon, the nothingness takes form, appearing as wraithlike figures with
quicksilver eyes.  The lost spirits beckon, whispering promises of knowledge
and power, carressing you with limbs of wispy cold.  You find yourself
moving, if such can be discerned in an unchanging landscape, and after what
seems like an eternity you arrive at a blackened gate hanging in the
nothingness.  

Here your chilling escort fades, but the whispers remain, as well as shining
pinpoints of silver light.  They call for you to step through, to become one
with the power of the void.  You hesistate, and begin to float through. 
Whether this is by your will or that of some malevolent force is unclear. 
You pass through, and all becomes light.  

White fire rages about you, blinding you with its sheer intensity.  Tongues
of flame envelop you and you can feel your flesh blacken and flake like
burnt parchment.  You can not even scream in agony as the very air is burnt
from your lungs, suffocating you even as you are consumed..  

The light fades suddenly, and you find yourself again in Kzroth\@s chamber,
the Mark of the Damned seared into your memory.
