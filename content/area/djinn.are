Dullaek Pak~
The Djinn Caliph, Dullaek Pak, hovers upon his throne.
~
Dullaek Pak, the greater djinni, rises before you in a vast blur which
flickers between two images.  The first is an enormous, barrel-chested
humanoid more than twelve meters tall, muscled and bronze-skinned, with an
intense hawkish face and wild locks of black hair.  The second is a whirling
silver wind funnel, laced with flashing sparks of raw energy.  

Caliph of the border region between the the elemental plane of air and the
prime plane, Pak rules his domain with the wild, fierce glee.  His morals and
purposes are things more elemental than mortal, thus beyond the understanding
of mortal beings.

Meandering banks of many-hued clouds, wispy tendrils of swirling vapors,
and gyrating whirls of smoke surround you.  In the distance, vague humanoid
blurs weave along obscure currents to destinations unseen.  Great whirling
vortexes appear and disappear, accompanied by halos of jagged lightning. 
All around you, breezes spin, zephyrs tug and twist, and sudden gales
embrace you in frenetic blasts of air.  
~
>data_prog desc4~
Wind billows furiously around you, randomly shifting direction from
moment to moment.  In every direction, unending sky reaches out to the
limits of perception.  Tumbling, twisting clouds and funnels of smoke spin
in the distance, following unseen, erratic currents.  Your senses are
assaulted by a cacophony of moans, whistles, and howls, as well as fleeting
scents both wrenchingly foul and exotically fair.  
~
>data_prog desc3~
Dappled clouds and convoluting wreathes of mist and fog swirl about the
elemental plane of air.  Strong winds buffet you and disappear, replaced by
gentle zephyrs which in turn grow into howling gusts.  There is no downward
pull of gravity, and though light glows and recedes with the clouds and fog,
there are no suns nor moons to account for the illumination.  Unearthly,
piercing shrieks and deep, shuddering moans occasionally rise up over the
whistling of the wind, though it is unclear from what direction or source.  
~
>data_prog desc2~
Mist and haze enfold you in convoluted eddies and currents as you pass
through the elemental plane of air.  In the distance, vortexes of brilliant,
shifting color reel around twisting, gyrating clouds and massive cyclones of
smoky haze, all in a chaotic mottle of color, motion, and howling,
whispering, shrieking sounds.  Faint blurs of humanoid-like form meander in
the distance, weaving through the tempestuous billows.  
~
>data_prog desc1~
You are in an unbound panorama of air, with no land visible in any
direction.  It seems that a very weak pull of gravity is focused all around
you, coming from many different directions at once, and that darkness and
light shift without any sun, moons, or stars to account for the change. 
Clouds in striations of every hue swirl and tumble in the distance, and the
wind whistles piercingly around you, tugging in one direction and then
another.

A Chaotic Wind~
You are in an unbound panorama of air, with no land visible in any
direction.  It seems that a very weak pull of gravity is focused all around

A Chaotic Wind~
Dappled clouds and convoluting wreathes of mist and fog swirl about the
elemental plane of air.  Strong winds buffet you and disappear, replaced by
gentle zephyrs which in turn grow into howling gusts.  There is no downward
pull of gravity, and though light glows and recedes with the clouds and fog,
there are no suns nor moons to account for the illumination.  Unearthly,
piercing shrieks and deep, shuddering moans occasionally rise up over the
whistling of the wind, though it is unclear from what direction or source.

A Chaotic Wind~
Wind billows furiously around you, randomly shifting direction from
moment to moment.  In every direction, unending sky reaches out to the
limits of perception.  Tumbling, twisting clouds and funnels of smoke spin
in the distance, following unseen, erratic currents.  Your senses are
assaulted by a cacophony of moans, whistles, and howls, as well as fleeting
scents both wrenchingly foul and exotically fair.

Mist and haze enfold you in convoluted eddies and currents as you pass

shifting color reel around twisting, gyrating clouds and massive cyclones of
smoky haze, all in a chaotic mottle of color, motion, and howling,

A Chaotic Wind~
Wind billows furiously around you, randomly shifting direction from
moment to moment.  In every direction, unending sky reaches out to the
limits of perception.  Tumbling, twisting clouds and funnels of smoke spin
in the distance, following unseen, erratic currents.  Your senses are
assaulted by a cacophony of moans, whistles, and howls, as well as fleeting
scents both wrenchingly foul and exotically fair.

A Chaotic Wind~
Mist and haze enfold you in convoluted eddies and currents as you pass
through the elemental plane of air.  In the distance, vortexes of brilliant,
shifting color reel around twisting, gyrating clouds and massive cyclones of
smoky haze, all in a chaotic mottle of color, motion, and howling,
whispering, shrieking sounds.  Faint blurs of humanoid-like form meander in
the distance, weaving through the tempestuous billows.

A Chaotic Wind~
Dappled clouds and convoluting wreathes of mist and fog swirl about the
elemental plane of air.  Strong winds buffet you and disappear, replaced by
gentle zephyrs which in turn grow into howling gusts.  There is no downward
pull of gravity, and though light glows and recedes with the clouds and fog,
there are no suns nor moons to account for the illumination.  Unearthly,
piercing shrieks and deep, shuddering moans occasionally rise up over the
whistling of the wind, though it is unclear from what direction or source.

A Chaotic Wind~
You are in an unbound panorama of air, with no land visible in any
direction.  It seems that a very weak pull of gravity is focused all around
you, coming from many different directions at once, and that darkness and
light shift without any sun, moons, or stars to account for the change. 
Clouds in striations of every hue swirl and tumble in the distance, and the
wind whistles piercingly around you, tugging in one direction and then
another.

in the distance, following unseen, erratic currents.  Your senses are
assaulted by a cacophony of moans, whistles, and howls, as well as fleeting
scents both wrenchingly foul and exotically fair.

A Chaotic Wind~
Mist and haze enfold you in convoluted eddies and currents as you pass
through the elemental plane of air.  In the distance, vortexes of brilliant,
shifting color reel around twisting, gyrating clouds and massive cyclones of
smoky haze, all in a chaotic mottle of color, motion, and howling,
whispering, shrieking sounds.  Faint blurs of humanoid-like form meander in
the distance, weaving through the tempestuous billows.

A Chaotic Wind~
You are in an unbound panorama of air, with no land visible in any
direction.  It seems that a very weak pull of gravity is focused all around
you, coming from many different directions at once, and that darkness and
light shift without any sun, moons, or stars to account for the change. 
Clouds in striations of every hue swirl and tumble in the distance, and the
wind whistles piercingly around you, tugging in one direction and then
another.

A Chaotic Wind~
Dappled clouds and convoluting wreathes of mist and fog swirl about the
elemental plane of air.  Strong winds buffet you and disappear, replaced by
gentle zephyrs which in turn grow into howling gusts.  There is no downward
pull of gravity, and though light glows and recedes with the clouds and fog,
there are no suns nor moons to account for the illumination.  Unearthly,
piercing shrieks and deep, shuddering moans occasionally rise up over the
whistling of the wind, though it is unclear from what direction or source.

A Chaotic Wind~
Wind billows furiously around you, randomly shifting direction from
moment to moment.  In every direction, unending sky reaches out to the
limits of perception.  Tumbling, twisting clouds and funnels of smoke spin
in the distance, following unseen, erratic currents.  Your senses are
assaulted by a cacophony of moans, whistles, and howls, as well as fleeting
scents both wrenchingly foul and exotically fair.

A Chaotic Wind~
Meandering banks of many-hued clouds, wispy tendrils of swirling vapors,
and gyrating whirls of smoke surround you.  In the distance, vague humanoid
blurs weave along obscure currents to destinations unseen.  Great whirling
vortexes appear and disappear, accompanied by halos of jagged lightning. 
All around you, breezes spin, zephyrs tug and twist, and sudden gales
embrace you in frenetic blasts of air.

You are in an unbound panorama of air, with no land visible in any

you, coming from many different directions at once, and that darkness and

Dappled clouds and convoluting wreathes of mist and fog swirl about the
elemental plane of air.  Strong winds buffet you and disappear, replaced by
gentle zephyrs which in turn grow into howling gusts.  There is no downward
pull of gravity, and though light glows and recedes with the clouds and fog,

The Hall of Mists~
You are within the Hall of Mists, a nebulous, graceful palace in the
elemental plane of air.  The walls are a cloudy, swirling mix of stark
grays, jet blacks, and pure whites.  This appears to be the central room of
the hall--a vast circular chamber with a high vaulted ceiling, formed of
ominous rotating storm clouds.  A strange blue pool in the center of the
hall rests within the misty floor, bubbling occasionally, with a thick haze
above it.  Pillar-like structures, flickers of blue flame wreathed in
columns of smoke, form a broad circle around the pool.

Erratic currents of air weave through a swirling cyclonic funnel of

Clouds in striations of every hue swirl and tumble in the distance, and the

A Chaotic Wind~
You are in an unbound panorama of air, with no land visible in any
direction.  It seems that a very weak pull of gravity is focused all around
you, coming from many different directions at once, and that darkness and
light shift without any sun, moons, or stars to account for the change. 
Clouds in striations of every hue swirl and tumble in the distance, and the
wind whistles piercingly around you, tugging in one direction and then
another.
