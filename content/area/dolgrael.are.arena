Akatheian~
Akatheian~
Akatheian the human is here.
~
Standing just a bit over six feet in height, Akatheian exudes an aura of
leadership and charm.  Hawk-like green eyes are framed by dark ebony
eyebrows.  His hair is tied severely into a small braid that just barely
reaches his shoulders.  Slightly sunken cheeks, along with highly structured
cheekbones, suggest that this is a man who does not care to indulge his own
physical needs.  While Akatheian\@s confident stance and demeanor further
enhances his aura of command, it also illustrates his already tall, but
thin, body.  An almost perpetual half-smile is evident on his face, except
those few times that something or someone manages to anger him.  Akatheian\@s
hands are hidden underneath a constant pair of black leather gloves.  The
hilt of a blade can be seen showing, though the rest of his blade is hidden
underneath his cloak.

Vashel~
Vashel, Mistress of War, Captain of the Invincibles stands here.
~
A beautiful dark-haired woman stands assertively in front of you.  Her
firmly muscled body is well-proportioned for fighting and holds a deadly
sort of grace.  Her steel armor holds a menacing beauty to them, and were
obviously crafted by a divine hand.  The black steel with silver trim
provides a startling contrast to each other.  Her eyes are the lightest
blue, and have a somewhat cold quality to them, as if they were filled with
tiny ice chips.  Her gaze when she looks upon a person is frigidly
calculating and solemn.

Dilasem~
Dilasem meditates within the chamber, ready for any challenges.
~
Dilasem is approaching his elderly years with grey hair that is slowly
turning white.  While he might be slightly past his prime, his hardened
muscles and unyielding appearance suggests he is still well able to defend
himself.  Twenty years before Dilasem had achieved a glorious reputation by
leading a phalanx of the Invincibles in a border war.  His valor and courage
had won him the rank of Lieutenant amongst the Invincibles, and the sigil of
the Hammer of Steel.  Now in retirement, Dilasem has chosen to spend the
last of his years near his god, and to spend time training the active
members of the Invincibles.

Nehruin, the high priest of the temple, is a tall man in the prime of his
life.  His brown hair is closely cut, and he is conservatively dressed in
gray robes without any adornments or embroidery.  Nehruin, while not a
member of the Legion of the Invincibles, has taken it upon himself to take
care of his temple.  He orchestrates the many other priests into making sure
that the temple grounds are well cared for, and that nothing goes awry. 
While the task is large, and the material rewards small, Nehruin goes about
his duties with a calm acceptance.

This belt appears to have been forged out of a thin, and extremely

polished enough to be able to give a hazy reflection of its surroundings.

A Smokey Room~
Here in this nondescript room a perpetual pall of smoke hangs in the air,
making exact vision and details harder.  The walls of the room have been
constructed out of solid oak wood, except for the crude stone fireplace to
the west.  Simple wooden rafters support the low ceiling above.  A bar,
though no bartender, sits in the southern corner.  Most of the room is bare
and empty.  Only in the northern corner do you see a table with several
chairs around it.  The room is badly illuminated with no windows and only a
few lanterns that hang from various places on the wall.  Back to the south
you see the murky portal from which you entered from.

Twin trampled mounds of earth are positioned on each side, the grass
barely clinging to its soil.  Boot-prints old and new scar the ground
in-between the mounds, in some places the fresh earth\@s overturning displays
moist soil.  To the north, a large, grassy hill rises, filling the horizon
with earth and foliage.  A massive stone wall circle the hill, with gates at
the southern trail up the knoll.  At the very top, a red marble structure
juts into the sky, with its domed ceiling raised to the heavens.

A large stone wall circles the hill, composed of unmarred grey granite
stones stacked with ends overlapping.  Upon the wall you can see carved
gleaming scarlet arcane runes that seem to imbue the wall with strength and
permanence.  Blades of green grass cover the earth even to the base of the
hill, where it stops several inches from the outer wall.  The hill rises
steadily to the north, towering over the countryside around it.  A massive
steel gate is present between the opening in the granite wall, scored with
the same runes that protects the wall.

The hill climbs upward, the green carpet of grass mixing with a few trees
between the outer and inner circles.  Also present amongst the grass are
small green bushes that seem to thrive in this hilly terrain, bearing an
impressive assortment of red berries and sharp thorns.  To the south a large
ring of stone surrounds the hill.  Northward, and farther up the mount,
another stone wall circles the hilltop, closing off the building at the
highest point.  A wide set of granite stairs begin here, leading to the top
of the hill.  Wildflowers mix with the grasses, but only a few, standing out
in small clumps among the covering of grass.

Along the side of the hill, in between the two circular walls is a quiet
area filled with grass and an occasional few trees.  It is apparent that
this land here receives care and nurturing from the staff of the temple,

In this recess the earthen walls have been excavated to form crude
shelves in which simple foodstuffs and supplies can be stored on.  The
alcove, and shelves, are small, suggesting that the supplies stored here are
for emergency use only.  A neat bundle of furs from various forest animals,
which lie at the bottom of one of the shelves, indicate were the predominant

A Crudely Dug Cave~
Inside the hill is a crudely dug cave.  It appears to have been hollowed
out shovel by shovel, as hinted from the rough marks and scars on the
earthen walls.  Thick tree roots form the veins of the walls, giving it a
very textured look.  On the floor of the cave grows various small weeds and
plants, indicating that the cave was not just excavated recently.  The whole
cave has the look of being constructed out of a simple necessity, and not a
need for comfort or elegance.  A pile of refuse is piled neatly into one
corner, obviously waiting to be disposed outside.  A small stone lever comes
out of the wall by the entrance of the cave.  To the east and west are small
recesses that further widen this cave.  To the south is a wider area, where
the earthen floor and walls has been smoothed.

simple necessities are stored into small alcoves dug into the walls.  These
necessities range from a single unlit tallow candle, to some simple homespun
clothing that is folded neatly into each alcove.  A few pieces of wood lie
on the floor here, sitting next to a flint and steel.  A modest hole, now
covered by a blanket of grass, has been dug into the ceiling, allowing any
smoke from a tiny fire to escape the confines of the cave.  To the west the

artists spent their lifetimes to paint the murals that decorate the temple
dome.  These murals range from stylistic representations of famous battles,
including the fight between Converu and the Blight of Celanim, and the
symbolic icon of Dolgrael himself: the silver hammer with the ebony handle. 
The walls of the temple have been decorated with motifs showing Dolgrael as
taught the art of metalworking and the smith to the mortals after the
Sundering.  The altar to honor is to the east, while the altar to the War of
Night is to the west.  To the north stands the central altar of the Temple,

that sparkles in the light of the temple.  Some who have spent a night\@s

hammer with swirls of obsidian giving the handle a darker ebony appearance. 
This hammer is said to be an enlargement of the actual hammer that Dolgrael
wields in his forge and against his foes.  This is the place where the
worshippers and supplicants to Dolgrael come to pray for strength and honor
in future endeavors, as well as give thanks for the past.  Fallen comrades
and foes alike have been honored here, for those who follow Dolgrael
understand that an honorable foe is to be treasured as much as any ally.

The Forge of Dolgrael~
Built, it appears, in the heart of a mountain, the colossal smithy of
Dolgrael rises high into the heavens.  Beautiful masterpiece pieces of armor
and weaponry line the walls of the forge, giving off auras of beauty and
deadliness.  A large ruby red marble anvil, over ten feet tall and over
thirty feet wide, dominates the center of the room.  A blazing blue inferno
dances within an enormous furnace built into the mountain.  You can also see
an unadorned granite well, filled with cobalt blue water, close to the
anvil.  A simple steel throne is rooted to the mountain floor, by the side
of the anvil.

Behind the Inner Wall~
Here in this area is the quiet region between the inner wall and the
walls of the temple.  Lush grass and plants once again grows once several
inches away from the wall.  Various worshipers and priests can be seen
walking about, involved in their own private thoughts.  To the west of you
is the large stone wall of the inner circle, which stretches around the
hill.  To the east is the temple proper.  To the north you can see the
well-defined area of the dueling circle, where many go to either train or
settle grievances.  To the southern side lies a more secluded area, where
the bushes and trees have been allowed to grow to help shield the outside

The Dueling Circle~
The area here has been cleared out of grass, and instead is composed of
packed down dirt in a large circular pattern.  Two smaller inscribed perfect
circles, one of silver and one of obsidian, are centered equidistant inside
the larger crimson circle, forming the boundary of the dueling circle.  To
the west in the wall you notice a small window set low, allowing the light
from a setting sun to shine upon those who duel within the circle.  To the

You are currently upon a jagged piece of land that is floating in the

the clouds as they drift past at a swift pace.  Intermittently some birds
can be seen flying through the clouds, periodically visible through the
breaks in the clouds.  The island itself appears to have been a piece of
white marble mixed with vein of silver that was forcibly torn from the earth
and cast into the air.  The surface of it has been polished to the extent
that it is possible to see ones reflection by gazing at it.  Jutting out of
the center of the island are two large obsidian columns bearing arcane runes
that support a crimson portal between them.

you note that no animals or insects of any kind seem to live upon these
battlefields.  To the south one can make out a few tents that are clumped

the tents an unnatural coloring, giving off shadows of pale red.  It is
obvious that such formations are used to simulate the feel of an actual
village, or as means to train for urban combat.  No efforts have been made
to decorate these tents to further the illusion of being a village however,
almost as if the people who erected them disdained of the need to do so.  In

Tall ebony trees are rooted firmly into the moist earth underneath them. 
Occasionally gnarled roots can be seen entwined amongst each other as they
compete for nutrients.  The dark leaves of the trees provide the canopy
overhead, leaving only a faint vermillion hue to be seen through the leaves
as an indication of the sky above.  The whisper of leaves can be heard as
they rustle against each other under the sway of the gentle winds.  Other

In a Thicket of Ebony Trees~
Tall ebony trees are rooted firmly into the moist earth underneath them. 
Occasionally gnarled roots can be seen entwined amongst each other as they
compete for nutrients.  The dark leaves of the trees provide the canopy
overhead, leaving only a faint vermillion hue to be seen through the leaves
as an indication of the sky above.  The whisper of leaves can be heard as
they rustle against each other under the sway of the gentle winds.  Other
than the ebony trees though, there appears to be no other forms of plants or
animals that dwell here.  To the north and west the thicket ends as the
silver plains begin.

Within the Vermillion Clouds~
The blanket of vermillion clouds stains the sky as it overcasts the
fields of combat below.  The vermillion clouds contain small currents of
trailing mist and vapor that move erratically under the whims of the winds
here.  Occasionally there are small holes amongst the clouds that allow the
sunlight to pierce through to the land below.  A silence hangs in the air
here as you note that no birds or other animals are present.  Below you, you
notice the grasslands of silver and two obsidian columns that support the
crimson portal, while to the south the vermillion clouds continue.

Underneath the Lake~
Beneath the calm waters of the lake, the lake waters are still crystal
clear.  The reddish light from above is slanted and spread here beneath the
waters, illuminating the limestone bottom of the lake.  The effects of the
winds from above stop after a few inches into the water, and the rest of the
water is still.  The absence of any fish or other creatures further adds to
the quiet and calm of the lake waters.  To the east you can make out a

An Underwater Passage~
The limestone walls surround you on all sides, as this passage leads
between the two crystal blue lakes.  The walls of the passage are rough, as
if the passageway had been blasted through, and the water has not yet had
the time to smooth away the jagged edges of the rock.  Perplexingly however
the contact and wear between the limestone and the water does not appear to
leave any traces within the water, leaving the water here as clear as the
lake water.  The passageway is fairly dark, due to the fact that no direct
light can reach through the layers of rock overhead.  To the east and west
the passageway continues to either of the blue lakes.

people to move through at the simultaneously.  The limestone rock of the
walls is rough and appears to be weeping a faint sheen of moisture, leading
to the occasional soft sound of a droplet of water colliding with another. 
Periodically a breath of air drifts through the tunnel, but does little to

An Island Within the Sky~
You are currently upon a jagged piece of land that is floating in the
skies like an island in the middle of an ocean.  Beneath you, one can view
the clouds as they drift past at a swift pace.  Intermittently some birds
can be seen flying through the clouds, periodically visible through the
breaks in the clouds.  The island itself appears to have been a piece of
white marble mixed with vein of silver that was forcibly torn from the earth
and cast into the air.  The surface of it has been polished to the extent
that it is possible to see ones reflection by gazing at it.  A silver
fountain pipes crystal clear water in the center of this area.  To the north
are two large obsidian columns bearing arcane runes that support a crimson
portal between them.
