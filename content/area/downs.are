a human farmer~
A human farmer steadily swings his scythe.
~
This field hand bears his scythe with an expertise born of long, long
practice.  His frame has been clearly influenced by his work, with lanky
arms that almost appear longer than his legs.  From time to time, he glances
at his son, ensuring that the boy is learning his tasks properly.

a dark-bearded human farmer~
A dark-bearded human farmer stands near the barn.
~
This man is average-sized, if a bit on the stocky side.  His swarthy,
sun-browned face is framed by a thick black beard, extending nearly to his
dark eyes.  His role appears to be mainly a supervisory one, as he spends
most of his time staring out over the fields watching his workers. 
Nevertheless, his gaze does not appear at all harsh or oppressive.

A thin, green serpent slinks about on short legs.

This creature resembles a large green snake but for the four legs which
propel it.  Each of these is tipped with a set of digging claws, stout but
sharp.  Always staying close to the ground, it is constantly hunting for
prey.  Its thin eyes gleam with a hungry yellow, and it occasionally tastes
the air with a crimson tongue.

A transparent wraith floats here, emitting an eerie green light.

A long, billowing shade of deep, poisonous green hovers here, the
shapeless form little more than a ghostly cloak draped over an unseen
figure.  A pair of scabrous, transparent hands protrude from under the
cloak, twisted and clawed.  The face cannot be seen, concealed by the folds
of the cowl.  Some unfelt breeze stirs the wraith\@s garment, insubstantial
cloth filling and swaying silently.  A weird, unearthly illumination
flickers from within the wraith, filling the area with inconstant, ghostly
green light.

This fox is about as large as a medium-sized dog, but its green eyes
bespeak a feral cunning not often found in domesticated animals.  Its russet
pelt helps conceal it from its prey, and is valued by furriers.  The mud on

frame his simple face.  Alert eyes and a taut mouth imply a constant,
effortless vigilance, his body language relaxed yet watchful.  His throat is
a mass of scar tissue from some past wound, and he seems incapable of

This large wasp is a magnificent example of its species, fully two feet
from the tip of its head to the end of its abdomen.  Head, thorax, and
abdomen are all coated in almost fur-like bristles of deep, rich brown and
sunflower yellow.  The large abdomen pulses eagerly as the insect flies
around on gossamer wings.  The insect has no eyes; filmed-over chitin gapes
pitifully where they should be.  Several other features of the wasp seem
subtly wrong, too: the mandibles flex in front of a human mouth with thin
lips and crooked teeth, and the legs are tipped with malformed handlike
appendages which grasp and clutch at the air.

An ethron blacksmith is here, forging iron hoops.

This ethron man is only five feet tall but looks very strong.  Great
cords of muscle are visible all over his body, dripping sweat as he goes
about his tasks.  Every few moments he runs a sooty rag over his forehead,
removing sweat.  His constant exposure to heat and smoke seems to have
permanently darkened his green complexion.

A harrowing shade floats here, slowly undulating its arms.

The apparition is composed of bone-white mist.  It has the rough outline
of a humanoid skeleton, but possesses far too many arms: long, thin
appendages each crowned with a dozen long, thin claws, reaching horribly
away from its spindly torso.  The mouth of the spectre is so wide it almost
completely separates its head, and is filled with needle teeth.  Above the
mouth, a mass of ruby eyes stares with frightful malevolence.

to take great pleasure in his responsibilities as caretaker of this small
shrine, tending to the fountain, the statue, and even the grass with an
experienced and loving hand.  His once-brown eyes have aged into a mature
topaz, and they shine with wisdom and kindness.  Around his body is draped a

Ozin~
Ozin hovers restlessly, scheming.

This nefortu compensates for his short stature by hovering off the
ground, keeping his head about six feet high.  His angular, weasely face is
punctuated by a pair of beady black eyes which gleam with a low cunning. 
One of his ears is wrapped in a grubby bandage, inexpertly applied in the
field.  On the run from the law in most cities, Ozin has led his gang to the
Freehold to regroup and recover.  For the moment, he has decided to bide his
time, living off the land.

Baron Wheddence~
Tall and portly, Baron Eladam Wheddence stands here, exuding importance.
~
The middle-aged Baron Wheddence, the seventeenth-wealthiest man in Ashta
Harrud, is a tall, heavyset man, bearing a pronounced paunch.  The majority
of his face is covered by a luxuriant beard and mustache, with truly
enormous sideburns hiding his jawline.  He appears to have a habit of
forceful gesticulation, constantly waving his pudgy hands for emphasis.

A wreath of lilies crowns her head, and her arms reach out in an expression
of brightest welcome to all who approach her.  Grass grows around her feet,
and though the statue has been kept clean of moss and other stains, several
oddly-worn patches suggest this statue has been used a perch for many a bird

West of the vast and fertile Lithling Valley is a small hilly country

succession of princes who had as their seat a small citadel on a chalky hill
near the Dantaron.  

For a number of generations, the fiefdom was ruled peacefully and
unobtrusively, until a sudden cataclysm saw the entire dynasty felled at a
stroke.  With the mysterious death of the ruling family, the fiefdom
disintegrated, and was largely ignored by subsequent conquerors in favor of
the strategically far more valuable vale of Lithling proper.

embittered by the rejection of his suit to one of their daughters, betrayed
the royal family, murdering them by poison and carrying off the princess by
force.  To seal his vengeance, he bound a shade to the tomb of the high
prince, dooming him to an eternity of torment.  With the collapse of the
royal line, the eastern aristocrats were able to assert control over Jasa
Lake and the Dantaron, thus gaining the river access they had long sought.

Like most alatharya, he liked eating and breaking things!

He was tired of young Darien ruining his things, so he decided to put him to work sorting books instead.

[The aelin has a gentler expression on his face as he points out a huge stack of books to a visibly confused Darien.]
~
E

Darien, being not -quite- as dull as the average alatharyan, got the hang of his new job and even got to like it!

[Darien is shown smiling happily atop a ladder with an enormous pile of books in his hand.]
~
E

He got to like it SO much that he would even read the books when he wasn\@t working!

[Here, Darien is holding a copy of \#The Races of Avendar\# upside down.]

One day, he met the trickster god, Tzajai the Incomprehensible.

[A cackling nefortu is shown in front of a visibly shocked Darien.]

Tzajai told Darien that he would be allowed to make one wish. Darien wished for his very own library, with books he could read all he wanted!

{WAn Inessan Bedtime Story{n

(for Ill-Behaved Young Boys and Girls)
  
           by Cifete Elath-del the Songbird, 
         Sister of Yamr, Priestess of Alajial
  
   
                   \$  *  \$  *  \$
  
  
   
  
  
Author\@s note: When traveling to Inessa, I prefer the folksier, modest
accommodations of an Inessan home to Nika\@s inn, and exchange a new
composition or adventurous epic tale with my hosts for supper and a pallet. 
Often, I find myself unexpectedly presented with a tale or two from my
hosts, such as this bedtime story I recently overheard.  
    -C.E.D.
~
E
book2~
\#There once was a little boy named Chaith elm-Kalult and all of Inessa
knew him to be the most mischievous child in the village.  Chaith elm-Kalult
was so mischievous, he had his mother sew a back pocket onto his grey
breeches for the sole reason of carrying mischief with him wherever he went.
Of course, Chaith elm-Kalult did not tell his mother this was the reason he
requested the back pocket.  Chaith elm-Kalult told his mother the back
pocket was needed to tote his monthly allowed coin for the sweemeats and
trinkets he bought when the wandering peddler brought his wares to the
village.  
    
At first, Chaith elm-Kalult\@s misdeeds were harmless.  Chaith elm-Kalult
would knock the warblers out of the Rowan Tree with his slingshot and feed
the injured birds to the Charcoal Burner\@s scrawny cats, or he would smear
little Tomik\@s wolf-pup with Anya\@s honey and hold his sides and laugh as
the pup chased his tail, trying to bite the enormous houseflies back. 
  
But eventually Chaith elm-Kalult grew bored of such misdeeds, and he
sought more mischievous ones.  Once, he added just a touch of hellebore
bought from Old Althea to the goats\@ feed, and Inessa couldn\@t stay off
their chamber-pots for a week.  Another time, he set a hidden bear trap
within the weeds directly beneath the ogre parchment tacked to the side of
the barn, and a water templar passing through bound for Port Gaald mangled
her left foot when she stepped closer to read the reward notice.  If not for
her guild knowledge in the Waters of Jolinn, the templar might have had her
trip delayed more than just half a day.
~
E
book3~
Chaith elm-Kalult did not apologize for the incident, though.  He did not
even confess his misdeed and show true remorse by enrolling within the
School of Heroes to study as a peaceful true water scholar who wandered the
lands healing the sick and unfortunate.  Instead, Chaith elm-Kalult
snickered behind the barn as the Inessan elders tried to persuade the water
templar not to tell the Var Bandor Water Templar faction about Inessa\@s
unique way of recruiting ogre killers. 
  
So, no one was truly surprised when mischief befell Iyalisn M\@pryl, Lord
General of Aramril and Son of Jolinn, Zelenaes Vel\@taar, Warrior Pegasus and
Voice of Rystaia, and Jorir Tularnki, Wolf of Free and Blade of Girikha upon
one of their visits to Inessa.  The three Champions had just finished a
successful raid on the Halls of the Shunned Witches, and decided to rest for
a drink and sustenance at Nika\@s Inn on their return to the Golden Tower.  
  
Word of the three spirit templars present within the village spread like
plague, and every able-bodied man, woman and child crammed Nika\@s tiny bar
to get a glimpse of the three renown warriors of the Light and hear their
most recent tale of triumph for the cause.  Chaith elm-Kalult pushed his way
into the bar as well, for such close quarters were the perfect cover for
mischief.
~
E
book4~
Unbeknownst to his mother, every Mettenday Chaith elm-Kalult had been
dabbling in fire majicks under the tutelage of a rogue Var Bandor fire
scholar instead of buying supplies for the household.  So, eager to practice
his newly learned skills (and cause mischief at the same time), Chaith
elm-Kalult jostled through the crowd of awed people until he was standing
directly behind Jorir\@s seated form and bushy tail.   
  
Giggling uncontrollably, and with visions of an enflamed, leaping and
howling Jorir in his head, Chaith elm-Kalult rubbed his thumb and forefinger
together.  But instead of producing a small flame between the fingers (which
would have then raced up Jorir\@s tail), a single small spark leapt from
Chaith elm-Kalult\@s fingers onto the spirit templar\@s tail, sizzling a
second or two before fading and dying.  
  
Now, Chaith elm-Kalult might not have been found out as the trickster,
even with his fingers leaking tell-tale curled smoke.  But the village of
Inessa had tired of Chaith elm-Kalult\@s mischief, so as one, drew back from
him to expose his misdeed. 
  
And hardly missing a beat in the flow of conversation with his Champion
brothers, Jorir turned, opened his mouth wide, revealing long, white sharp
teeth, and devoured Chaith elm-Kalult in one bite.

An ivory longsword with a gleaming gold hilt rests here.~
This mighty weapon was forged with divine purpose and authority by the
capable hands of Ch\@hiern, the legendary artisan of the Warders.  Though he
was most known for his armorments and skills at defense, Ch\@hiern also knew
that the best way to defend yourself was to either turn your enemies away or
defeat them rapidly.  \#Justice\#, or \#Ev\@hac\#, was a commanding force on any
battlefield striking fear into its enemies and fervor into its allies.  

It came into being when Ch\@hiern had a vision of a great battle in a dream
that felt too real to ignore.  The opposition was fierce, vile and terrible
with hope being worn thin before them.  He woke with a clear thought of the
tool necessary to repel the hoards of evil and began forging it immediately.
Known to imbue his creations with powerful magic, Ch\@hiern began to pray to
Rystaia for divine powers to be molded into the weapon.  

Almost immediately, a visitor came upon his forge, she said that her name
was Calaera and that she had been directed here by a divine presence to
obtain a weapon that would alter the fate of the world.  The two then prayed
over the sword for hours, each channelling their energies into it until it
began to exude an audible vibration.  It was then declared that this weapon
would bring justice upon the dark forces that had laid Ad\@masteisa to waste.

A Green, Open Pasture~
A small path makes its way through an open pasture here.  The terrain is
gentle, rolling hills slowly rising into forested lands far to the south,
and flattening down to the banks of the swift Dantaron River to the north. 
About you, tough green grass carpets the ground.  The hills which slowly
rise to the south, east, and west appear to be comprised of chalk - bits of
white stone show through the ground cover.  To the east a small copse of
silver-barked trees rise, and the path continues to the south, where it
passes by a small barn.

A Copse of Birches~
You are in a small stand of slender birch trees.  The silver-skinned
trees, trunks peeling with papery bark, stretch overhead.  Gentle, rolling
hills rise to the south, carpeted with tough green grass.  To the north, the
wide Arien Plains can be seen in the distance across the river Dantaron, a
veritable sea of grass bending in the wind.  The copse of trees continues to
the east, and a small dirt path is visible to the west.  A grass-covered
hill of chalky white stone rises slightly to the south.

A Copse of Birches~
You are in a small stand of slender birch trees.  The silver-skinned
trees, trunks peeling with papery bark, stretch overhead.  Gentle, rolling
hills rise to the south, carpeted with tough green grass.  Far, far off to
the north, across the river, the sweeping Brintor Mountains can be seen
rising up out of the Arien Plains.  The copse of trees continues to the
west, and a small, unclimbable face of blank chalk rises to the east.  A
grassy field slowly declines away to the south.

An Open Field~
This wide, open field stretches out around you, inclining ever so
slightly to the north.  A copse of silvery birch trees grow in that
direction.  To the south, a low wall of stacked stone stands at the edge of
a small gully.  The field is full of verdant, knee-high wildgrass, each
stalk tough and woody, though quite green.  A low, thatched building is
visible to the west.  To the east, a hill gently rises, the chalky rock
showing through the grass in spots.

A Rising Chalk Hill~
You stand on the side of a low hill in the Lithling Freehold.  The chalky
ground is covered in tough green grass, and there is very little in the way
of trees or bushes.  The ground continues sloping upwards to the north,
cresting a short distance away.  The slope evens out to the west and south. 
Southwards, several small, simple buildings are clustered together in a
modest hamlet.  The hill continues descending to the east.  A few stunted
shrubs of bracken and heather vie with the grass but do not seem to be
thriving.

Atop a Low Hill~
You stand atop a low chalk hill.  To the north, you can see a long, dusty
decline leading down to the the shore of the Dantaron River.  Birch trees
grow down the hill to the west, their flexible tops on level with the ground
on which you stand.  Eastward, a small, dusty road has been cut into the
hillside, leading north to south.  Broad beech trees ring the top of the
hill.  Their positioning is such that is is not clear if they were planted
in this ring, or grew naturally; both are possible.  A simple chalky boulder
protrudes from the hilltop, its top worn smooth from apparent centuries of
use as a bench.  The hill drops precipitously for a short distance on all
sides but one.  The only safe way down is south.

At the Bottom of a Low Hill~
The ground begins sloping upwards to the west here, with more rocks
visible pushing to the surface.  The chalky pebbles seem to choke off the
plant life to some extent, but a fair amount of grass and shrubbery still
appears able to thrive.  Westwards, the slope continues upwards to a chalk
ridge, while a stand of mature aspen trees grows in the more fertile soil to
the south.  An outdoor shrine lies to the east, and a dirt path follows a
barely-perceptible downwards slope to the north.

A Small Dirt Path~
This dirt path leads out of the hilly freehold to the flat river plain
near Var Bandor.  It appears well-trodden by people and animals of all
descriptions, particularly geese.  Wagon ruts give some sign of the commerce
between the farms and the city, bringing crops and honey to the river
traffic running between Var Bandor and Earendam.  Though the woods encroach
upon the path to the east and west, it is easily passable to the north and
south.

A Stand of Aspens~
A small cluster of aspen trees, tall and stately, stretch their
branches overhead.  One of the larger trees has a small carving in its
smooth, greenish-grey bark.  A small dirt clearing sits in the middle of the
stand of trees, worn by someone or something over a long period of time. 
The ground is disturbed and gnarled with the intertwined roots, begrudgingly
giving way to the tough green grass at the edge of the copse.  The terrain
is gentle but hilly, rising and falling in all directions.  A particularly
large hill stands to the northeast, a ring of standing stones crowning the
top.  A small building can be seen in the distance to the west, a plume of
smoke rising from it.

This smithy is open to the air, sheltered by a wooden roof with a hole
for ventilation.  At its center, a great stone furnace glows red-hot, its
enormous leather bellows protruding from one side.  From a row of hooks
along one side of the roof, various smithying and measuring tools are hung. 
Near the furnace is a huge iron anvil along with a barrel of water.

A Square Yard~
A tall oak shelters this open yard.  Roughly square, L-shaped fences
block off the corners.  Gates which once fitted into the openings facing in
each direction have long fallen off, and only one can be seen, half-covered
by grass at the edge of the yard.  The ground is hard, packed earth, the
occasional rock showing through.  To the southwest, over the fence, a low,
tumbledown stone building sits next to a paddock.  East, the smells of fire
and metal hang about what seems to be a smithy.  Two small houses sit to the
north, slightly ramshackle and unkempt.  Weeds grow around a tired, tiny
farmhouse to the south, a single bright yellow forsythia bush growing beside
the door.  Westward the open lands of the freehold spread out, a path
meandering its way along through them.

A Green, Open Field~
Tough green grass covers the hilly country of western Lithling, rising
and falling slightly with the rolling hills.  Southwards, the waist-high
grass is increasingly dotted with a shrub or low tree, as the terrain draws
closer to the Aragol River and the marshes of Jasa just beyond.  A wooden
gate opens into a paddock in the same direction, a small farm outbuilding
leaning next to it.  East, a fenced-off yard of packed dirt stands in the
shade of a tall oak.  Small buildings surround the yard, forming a small
hamlet.  A path meanders west, and the open country rises northwards to a
chalky hill.

Gentle, rolling terrain stretches out around you, tough green grass
growing thickly on the rises and declines.  White, crumbly stone shows
through the ground cover in many places, the limestone bones of the hills
providing a stark contrast to the lush grass.  A copse of slender birches
stands to the north, their silver bark distinct even from a distance.  Some
sort of simple building is visible to the west, a thatched roof and stone
walls dotted with moss.

A Path Through an Open Pasture~
A small path makes its way through an open pasture here.  The terrain is
gentle, rolling hills slowly decaying into the muddy shallows of Jasa far to
the south, and smoothing down to the Arien Plains far to the north.  About
you, tough green grass carpets the ground.  The hills which slowly rise
around you appear to be comprised of chalk - bits of white stone show
through the ground cover.  The path continues to the north and south.  To
the west, a low stone wall of crumbling, chalky limestone blocks the road,
the crude bricks stacked without mortar.  A barn squats to the east.

A small path makes its way over a low, grassy hill.  The terrain is
gentle and rolling, though it rises into ever-rougher and barer hills to the
west.  The Arien Plains can be seen far off in the distance to the north,
stretching beyond the horizon.  About you, tough green grass carpets the
ground.  The hill appears to be comprised of chalk - bits of white stone
show through the ground cover.  The path continues to the south, descending
and flattening into the bank of the river Aragol.  To the north, it passes
by a low thatched building.  An open field lies down the hill to the east,
and the hill steepens upwards to the west.

A Small Shrine on a Hill~
A circle of standing stones rings the top of this small hill, the chalky
rock cut into even blocks about seven feet tall.  The terrain is gentle,
rolling hills slowly descending into the muddy shallows of Jasa Lake far to
the south, and to the Dantaron River to the north.  A small copse of trees
is visible to the southwest.  Within the circle, a small altar sits at the
feet of a simple statue.  A gurgling fountain pours into a pool about the
statue, and several small fruit trees have been planted next to some of the
standing stones.  A feeling of peace and safety permeates the area. 
Pathways lead out of the circle in all directions.

circle standing stones~
These standing stones ring in the hill, each disappearing into the
grass-covered ground.  The grass within the circle is far more verdant than
that without, though the chalk of the hill shows through in patches.  Aged
runes of life and protection have been carved deeply into the stone.  
~
E
all_the_pretty_trees~
Small, shrublike trees grow inside the ring of stones, apparently planted
here.  Each tree is covered in dense, slightly heart-shaped leaves of a
dark, rich green.  A profusion of oblong fruits dot the trees.  
~
E
rune runes~
These runes are relatively simple, carved in deep, straight lines. 
Attention seems to have been given more to their longevity than their beauty
or elegance; some of the carvings reach nearly three inches into the milky
white, powdery stone.  Others are nearly effaced by the relentless march of
time, yet their power seems to persist in this place.

A Rolling, Grassy Slope~
In contrast to most of the nearby hills, this one is quite loamy,
displaying little of the white chalk dotting the others.  As a result,
plants thrive much better, with the slope carpeted by lush green grass and
clover, with the occasional bee making its rounds.  To the east, the ground
falls away into a depressed valley, and a ring of standing stones surrounds
a tree and a statue to the south.

This shallow gully is a long trough in the earth, roughly four feet deep.
It rises up a gentle incline to climb a hill eastwards, westwards losing
itself in a stand of trees.  The open sky stretches out overhead.  The edges
of the gully are bordered with tufts and clumps of the tough green grass
which carpets the surrounding terrain in patchy profusion.  A small slope
breaks the northern wall of the gully, allowing you to scramble up a steep
hillside.  The top of the hill to the north is ringed in large standing
stones.

Rising gently from the north, the valley ends here with only a vague
depression compared to the surrounding terrain.  The ground is host to a
sparse covering of grass, struggling to survive in the poor soil.  Flakes of
chalk litter the ground, fragile enough to break under even a light
footstep.  To the west, standing stones form a ring around a statue.  The
terrain continues its rise to the south, culminating in a low hill.

Several large rhododendron bushes clump around the base of the short

has been made in the middle of the partially sheltered ground.  A crude camp
is set up here, two rickety brush lean-tos and a ragged tent huddled around
a small fire pit.  The small valley rises to the east and west, climbing

The ground dips into a small dell here, ringed on all sides by bushy,
thick hemlocks of dark green.  The ground is carpeted in old hemlock
branches, stirred and scuffed up in many places.  The air is fresh and
piney, and breezes seem to waft through occasionally.  Gaps in the trees
lead vaguely to the north and south.  Tender green vines struggle through
the dense hemlocks in places, fighting for sunlight.  To the north, the
hemlocks open out onto a rolling, grassy slope.  They continue to the south,
the ground obscured somewhat by the deepening shadows.  To the east stands a
small, unpainted wooden shed.

You are on a rolling slope in a series of long, gentle hills.  A thicket
of boxthorn and brambles stands to the north, not quite dense enough to
block passage.  All about you the land rises and falls, carpeted with tough
green grass.  The Dantaron Bight can be seen over the thicket to the north,
and a series of chalky boulders blocks passage to the east.  On one of the
hills to the southwest, a circle of standing stones rings the hilltop like a
crown.  To the south, a copse of dark hemlocks stands in a dell.

The ground dips into a small dell here, ringed on all sides by bushy,
thick hemlocks of dark green.  The ground is carpeted in old hemlock
branches, stirred and scuffed up in many places.  A heavy iron hook hangs
from a wire cable stretched overhead.  The air is fresh and piney, and
breezes seem to waft through occasionally.  Gaps in the trees lead vaguely
to the north and west.  An odd shape in the dense hemlocks to the east
catches your notice, and on closer inspection seems to be a blind of sorts. 
A small gap can be seen beside it, leading east behind the blind.  Hanging
vines obscure the entrance.

reminiscent of meat hooks used by butchers.

white boulder of the same stone crowns the top of the hill here.  The rise

On the Bank of the Aragol River~
A short distance from the nearby settlements, the sounds of people are
largely cut off by the thick-branched trees around you.  On the other side
of the trees, the Aragol River flows, making its meandering way north to
meet the Dantaron.  Small animals scurrying along the ground are visible by
their disturbance of the grass, and occasionally the splashes they make
diving into the water.  To the north, the country opens out into rolling,
green hills.

A dirt path ends here on its way out of the hills, the terrain

terrain rises and falls in gentle hills.  A patch of rich black topsoil has
been carefully tilled into neat furrows.  Small green shoots of some stalked
plant poke up through the fertile earth.  A wattle fence, roughly three feet
high and woven from strips of alder wood, has been erected around the field.
A forlorn, threadbare scarecrow hangs drunkenly from a post in the center of
the field.  To the north, the land is covered by a snarl of impassably rocky
ground.  In all other directions the landscape spreads away.

threadbare scarecrow post~
In the center of the field, a pole ten feet high supports a vaguely
man-shaped figure stuffed with grass and hanging at a crazy angle.  Tied
burlap sacks appear to lend it shape, and it is crowned by what might once
have been some kind of hat.  Tufts of grass are whisked from it by every
gust of wind, and occasionally birds can be seen fluttering down to steal
pieces of it.

By the Dantaron River~
In all directions save north, undulating hillocks of stony ground stretch
away from you.  Sparse, tough grass grows here and there, but the soil is
poor and choked with rocks.  To the east and south the terrain flattens and
becomes more green.  The rocks continue to the west, trending into a barren
field of stones.  Northwards, the land descends to the Dantaron River.

Within a Low Barn~
The crude log roofbeams of this barn are relatively low, forcing taller
adventurers to stoop.  A roof of tightly-bundled thatch protects the barn
from the elements.  Light filters through chinks in the mortar and gaps in
the ceiling.  The barn is filled with the sweet, dusty smell of drying hay,
bundled in sheafs around the walls.  A simple floor of boards is raised off
the ground, allowing air to circulate.  A dark space can be seen underneath.
The walls are made from limestone blocks, stacked together and sealed with
thin mortar.

A Steep Chalk Hill~
This hill is steep but not terribly high, dwarfed by the much larger hill
a distance to the south.  Though chalky, the earth here can support a fair
amount of greenery.  Of particular interest are the rings of toadstools
crowning it, each of varying age.  Bird calls and the sounds of scampering
wildlife suggest that this is a less-cultivated part of the downlands.  To
the north and west, the hill descends to open fields, while a path leads
east.  A pile of craggy rocks prevents passage to the south.

Undulating hillocks of stony ground stretch away from you.  Sparse, tough
grass grows here and there, but the soil is poor and choked with rocks.  To
the east and south the terrain flattens and becomes more green.  The rocks
continue to the west, into a barren field of stones.  Farther to the west,
the downlands descend to the intersection of the two rivers outside the
distant walls of Var Bandor.  A stone retaining wall of crumbling, chalky
limestone rises to the east, blocking travel in that direction.

A Small Stand of Yew Trees~
A group of perhaps a dozen yew trees grow here in a loose cluster, the
puffy evergreen branches dense with short, deep green needles.  The rolling
terrain about the trees is somewhat rocky, dotted with patches of sparse
grass.  A small bare clearing, dusty and littered with needles, sits among
the yews.  The Lithling Freehold extends in all directions under the open
sky, the ground becoming generally more fertile to the east and north, and
stony and hard to the south and west.

An Open, Thinly-Grassed Field~
Thin, sparse green grass covers the Freehold of Lithling, rising and
falling slightly with the rolling hills.  Southwards, the waist-high grass
is increasingly dotted with a shrub or low marsh plant, as the terrain gives
way to the banks of the Aragol River.  Several large chalk boulders are
clustered here, beneath a spreading hornbeam tree.  Cedar and yew trees grow
rather thickly to the west, though passage is possible through them.  To the
east, the ground rises sharply to climb a low hill of white stone, dotted
with grass and shrubs.  Northwards, another small stand of yew trees grow in
a loose group.

A Small Vineyard~
The ground rolls in long, curving rows of hillocks, the sun-baked dirt
choked with stones.  Several patches of ground have been cleared and tilled,
set with wooden frames upon which grapevines grow.  The soil beneath is
hummocked and carefully kept free from weeds.  The terrain continues to the
east and south, growing more rocky to the west.  Far off to the west, beyond
a great chalky hill, the walls of Var Bandor can be faintly seen across the
Aragol River.

An Overgrown Field~
This field is decidedly overgrown.  Once tilled, the remains of wooden
fenceposts can be seen among the profuse weeds which choke the soil here. 
The terrain is almost impassable but for thin paths which seem to run in all
directions, converging in the middle of the clogged field.  All around you,
the terrain of the Lithling Freehold grows wilder and less cultivated, the
rolling hills covered with green grass.  A chalky hill rises to the west,
and trees crop up to the south and east.  Northwards, hillocks of cleared
soil have been planted with rows of grapevines.  The open sky spreads above
you.

A Copse of Evergreens~
Short, stunted evergreens grow here, crowding more closely together to
the south.  Firs, pines, cedars, and yew trees fill the air with their fresh
scent and coat the ground with fallen needles.  A vague path of sorts runs
between the trees, arriving at the base of a particularly large cedar
southwards and fading away on the open grasslands to the north.  The
vegetation is thin enough to force your way through to the east and west,
but not without some difficulty.

A Stony Field~
This open field is littered with stones of white limestone.  Small shrubs
of tough, brownish bushes grow here and there, and a creeping vine covers
several boulders, but other than that the land is barren.  The rocks becomes
larger and larger to the north and west, making passage impossible, but the
Dantaron can be seen and smelt in places to the north.  It flows to the
east, bending around a distant plateau.  To the southwest the ground rises
sharply into a steep chalky hill ringed with standing stones.  A small path
can be seen wending its way up the side.  To the east, a vineyard has been
tilled in the rocky soil, and the open fields continue to the south.

A Plateau on a Chalk Hill~
The slope flattens somewhat here, surmounted only by the very top of the
hill.  Even so, it commands a view of the rolling hills and woods all
around.  In contrast to the verdant growth surrounding it, this particular
hill is largely barren, with only a few hardy shrubs able to survive in the
calcareous earth.  Winding around the hill, a path can be seen leading to
the summit.  All around you, the steep sides of the hill slope downwards
into a comparatively wild and uncultivated part of the downlands.

The Downlands of Lithling~
Tough green grass covers this hilly country, rising and falling slightly
with the rolling hills.  Southwards, the waist-high grass is increasingly
dotted with a shrub or low tree, as the soil becomes more fertile closer to
the river.  To the north, the grass grows shorter and thins out as rocks
choke the soil.  A faint path winds its way through the grass, running north
to south.  To the northwest, a bare, chalky hill rises starkly from the
landscape.  Cedar and yew trees grow rather thickly to the east, though
passage is possible through them.  To the west, the land slopes down to the
river.

This area is nestled within a bend of the Aragol River as it flows north.
Here, the contrast in terrain is striking on either side of the river, with
chalky rock dominating your immediate surroundings, while across spread the
trees of the Nendor Forest.  A short distance to the north rises a large
hill, and the Aragol River is to the west.

Among the Evergreen Trees~
You stand at the base of a massive cedar tree.  It grows in a dense copse
of thriving cedars, yews, and firs which block passage to the south.  The
needles of the various evergreens blot out the sky overhead, and the dirt
beneath is littered in a thick carpet of fallen ones.  A small path makes
its way out of the trees to the north, opening onto the chalky downlands of
Lithling.  A thick rope ladder, the cordage knotted elaborately, hangs from
the branches of the cedar.

A Shrine to Elar~
Sweet-smelling cedar wood of a rich, reddish tone has been used to build
an irregular, asymetrical platform among the branches of this enormous oak
tree.  Approximately twenty feet square, the rough-hewn cedar poles are
tightly lashed together in sections, affording a secure perch.  The roughly
ovoid floor centers around the trunk of the tree, which has been shaped,
through magic, design, or coincidence, into the rough caryatid form of a
woman.  The trunk continues to grow naturally upwards from the figure\@s
head, unchanged.  A rope ladder, rungs also made from cedar, leads down to
the ground below.  To the south, the forest gives way to the reeds and
marshes around Jasa Lake, and the great chalk hills of the downlands can be
seen through the branches to the north.

The Start of a Chalk Path~
A narrow path has been beaten around the chalk hill, beginning with this
offshoot from the overlook to the east.  The woods can be seen, but the
noises of the woods and downlands are peculiarly muted by the interposed
bulk of the hill, giving this place a strange, deadened atmosphere.  The
path itself has been worn very smooth by untold years of traffic- indeed, it
might almost have been paved at some point.  Continuing upwards, the path
begins winding around the hill.

This path leads around a great mass of chalk, jutting like an exposed
bone from the green downlands.  Though steep, the path is reasonably
straight, and smooth enough to traverse without undue difficulty.  Sound has
a strangely muted quality here, most likely due to the large hill.  The path
splits here, allowing you to continue upwards to the summit or north around

A Path Around a Chalk Hill~
This narrow path of beaten, stony dirt winds its way around the steep
sides of the chalk hill.  The hill continues to jut upwards, levelling off
somewhere above.  To the northeast you are afforded a view of the rolling
hills of the Lithling Freehold, gradually becoming greener to the east. 
Northwest, the walls of Var Bandor can be seen, surrounded by the peninsular
docks which reach out into the muddy waters.  The path winds its way around
from the east, hugging the chalk face.  To the south, a dark triangle is

of runes are carved over the entrance, which seems to continue inwards.

Inside a Chalk Hill~
You stand in a low, cave-like room formed out of the soft white rock of
the hill.  Bare and featureless, the room is vaguely circular, with dead
leaves and whitish, dusty earth piled up in corners, blown by wind or
animals.  The air is stale and dusty, with a hint of something more cloying.
The ceiling is slightly stained with streaks from torch smoke.  A triangular
hole leads north out onto the side of the hill, and on the opposite side of
the room, a dark, round hole angles sharply down and into the stone.

A Dark, Chalky Tunnel~
This narrow tunnel feels almost more like a warren than a product of
civilization.  Low, winding, and narrow, the walls are worn smooth by time,
roughly as wide as it is tall.  Wan light from the outside filters in from
the northern end of the tunnel, which curves sharply up a short, scrabbling
ascent.  The air grows closer and heavier to the south.  A small side-tunnel
branches westward here, some odd scratchings marring the wall before the
split.  Soot streaks the ceiling, and the ever-present whitish dust covers
the rough floor, crumbled from the chalky walls.  The tunnel is dark and
still, wisps of cobweb hanging here and there.

These ancient scrapings are crusted over with the dust of centuries and

have had is faded or broken.

The small, winding tunnels come to a dead end here against a dry grotto. 
No ambient light is able to penetrate this far underground, combining with
the hunched nature of the passages to give a very definite and
claustrophobic sense of the vast weight of rock overhead.  The oppressive
darkness seems to carry with it a barely-imagined echo of some spoken
language, but its meaning is utterly impenetrable.  To the east, the
warren-like tunnel continues deeper into the hill.

floor.  The tunnel winds away into cobwebby darkness to the north, and
delves deeper down a steady decline to the south.  At the bottom of the
decline, a crude lintel has been carved from the stone, along with two
uprights, to form a door of sorts.  Three runes are carved over the door,
and primitive stairs sink beyond out of sight.  The air is dusty, close and
still, the faint sickly-sweet smell of rotting flesh on the air.

is riddled with several large cracks, and whitish dust fills the corners of
the room.  Primitive steps lead into the room from the north, ascending
sharply out of sight.  Four large sarcophagi are arrayed about the edges of
the room, the largest of the tombs built in the center.  The other three sit
against the eastern, western, and southern faces.  Simple wooden torches are
hammered into the walls, black streaks of grease and ash from their use
staining the walls.  The torches are long burnt down to stumps, leaving the
crypt silent and dark.  The air is heavy, still, almost expectant, and

Atop a Broken, Chalky Hill~
The summit of this chalky hill is the highest point in the region,
surpassed only by the majestic spire of Mount Enrien piercing the clouds far
to the southwest.  From this point, the Dantaron and Aragol rivers can both
be easily seen, though their junction is obscured by the city of Var Bandor
to the north.  The farms and people of the freehold are visible below you
all around, beyond the wilder, untended growth immediately surrounding the
hill.  A tall black menhir crowns the summit, and a beaten path around the
hill leads downward.

To the west, the Aragol river flows north towards Var Bandor from its
source in Jasa Lake.  Across the river spreads the forest of Nendor, within
which you are able to catch glimpses of trapping camps and a small village. 
~
E
south~
The view to the south is dominated by the majestic Mount Enrien,
towering over the surrounding forest and Jasa Lake.  The forest obscures
most of the ground from view, but you can see a small fishing village on the

east~
To the east, the country grows less rugged, with small patches of
farmland peeking through the trees covering this region.  The terrain
continues to smooth further east, giving way eventually to the vast
plantations across the stream in the vale of Lithling.  
~
E
north~
To the north, you see the rolling terrain of the Freehold, all farmland
and woods.  Further north, you can see the Dantaron river flowing eastwards
from the walled trading city of Var Bandor, and across it the vast expanse
of the Arien plains.  Far, far off in the distance, the Brintor Mountains
rise out of the plains.  
~
E
menhir~
This monolith must have come from somewhere distant, as it is made of a
basalt not to be found anywhere in the surrounding countryside.  It stands
thirteen feet high, and has been beaten into craggy roughness by untold
years of weathering.  About three feet from its base, a single sardonyx is
set so perfectly that its edges cannot even be felt.  
~
E
sardonyx sard~
Set in the menhir, this cream-colored gem has been polished to a mirror
finish, unmarred by the elements which have weathered the surrounding stone.
It is cut into a hexagon shape about two inches across, and divided by
sharply contrasting vertical bands of brilliant crimson.

A Tumbledown Home~
The rough-hewn logs of this home are not very well fitted, with chinks
between them easily the width of a finger despite valiant efforts to cover
them with daub and wattle.  The hard-packed dirt floor is covered here and
there with paving stones in an effort to give it some more solidity, and
these appear to be dutifully swept.  A small rock fireplace occupies the
northern wall, and a rickety shelf full of children\@s books stands next to
it.  To the south, the home opens without even a door onto an oak-shaded
yard.

A Rickety Farmhouse~
This small farmhouse is rather ramshackle building, with a tumbledown
rear wall.  Made from a mix of hewn planks and wattle-and-daubed plaster,
the home\@s ceiling relatively low.  Roofbeams are darkened with soot,
bunches of herbs and onions rubbing shoulders with a modest selection of
cookware.  Two windows with woven-twig shutters let in some light, and a
doorway leads north.  A narrow double bed stands against a wall, and a table
and braided rug stand in front of the stone fireplace.

A Descending, Grassy Slope~
Tough green grass covers this sloping hill as it gradually sinks down to
join the slow-moving Dantaron to the west.  The muddy water laps gently
against the sandy bank, cattails and rushes growing thickly at water\@s edge.
To the north and west, the land rises steeply into a stark, chalky hill, and
to the south the underbrush thickens into an impenetrable morass of muddy
brambles on the bank of the Aragol.  The ground levels off in a grassy field
to the east.

Behind a Camouflage Blind~
This camouflage blind has been cunningly woven into the hemlocks which
grow thickly around.  A carpeted bed of old boughs cushions those who wait
here.  The blind, made of curved branches lashed with sinew, is laced with
growing vines and living branches from the surrounding evergreen trees.  It
faces west, looking down a short drop through angular gaps in the blind. 
Overhead, the trees all but block out the sky.  A small gap in the blind
allows egress to the west, and a thin trail vanishes in the trees to the
east.

Inside an Unpainted Shed~
The inside of this small shed is clean, if far from uncluttered.  From
the ceiling hang a dozen beehive frames, haphazardly arranged to leave just
enough room for a path from one door to the other.  A workbench stretches
along the north side of the shed, with a row of empty glass jars arranged
neatly against the wall.  A tinderbox by the eastern door supplies fuel for
the smoker.  About five feet from the floor, a hanger suspends the heavy
canvas beekeeping suits.  Through a small glass window in the eastern wall,
the fields are visible.  Doors open in each side of the shed, west to the
path and east to the beehives themselves.

A Field of Clover~
A quarter-acre field of clover stretches around you, most of the flowers
bearing the weight of fat golden honeybees.  The insects give off a constant
hum as they fly from one flower to the next.  The plot as a whole is bounded
by oak trees, some of them appearing to contain beehives of their own.  A
dirt path leads west to the shed and north to a cleared area where a few
squat whitewashed boxes stand.

A Group of Beehives~
Nine wooden boxes about a yard high stand here in three neat rows.  The
whitewashing on them appears not to have been renewed for some time, with
paint visibly chipping off on all sides.  Notwithstanding the state of the
paint, the hives themselves appear to be in good condition, with the bees
swarming in and out constantly.  Here, the omnipresent buzzing escalates in
volume almost to a roar.  No flowers grow in the immediate vicinity, with
the ground having been trampled to hardness by not-infrequent foot traffic,
but a path leads to fields of clover and dandelions to the south and west. 
Oak trees block passage to the north and east.

A Field of Dandelions~
This quarter-acre is carpeted with yellow dandelions in bloom,
interspersed with puffy white ones gone to seed.  Everywhere, bees make
their punctuated way around the field, stopping to collect the precious
nectar from the flowers.  To the north and west, oak trees prevent travel,
some of them appearing to contain hives of wild bees.  The wall of an
unpainted wooden shed is to the south, and a dirt path leads east to a
cluster of whitewashed boxes.

A Dense Thicket~
You are surrounded by a thick mass of shrubbery and bushes, all sporting
varying amounts of prickles.  Small insects buzz away from the thicket,
disturbed by your passage, but the sounds of crickets and grasshoppers
reveal that many more remain.  The terrain here is flatter than most of the
Downlands, as the ground levels closer to the Dantaron River, visible
through impassably-dense brambles to the north.  Rolling hills can be
reached to the south, while a bight of the Dantaron curves around the land
to the east.

The Dantaron Bight~
This low plateau juts north toward the Arien Plains and seems to have
forced the Dantaron River to make its way around.  It is covered in the
hardy, tall grass of the plains, with shrubs and some trees appearing
towards its southern edge, further into the Freehold.  The plateau extends
north and east, crowned in that direction by a ruined watchtower, while a
thick grove of trees blocks passage to the south.

By a Ruined Watchtower~
The ground here is littered with black stones, most densely around the
ruins of what appears to have been a watchtower.  The inside of the tower is
empty except for more rubble and a crumbling stair, whatever treasure it may
once have contained having long since been carried off.  The area commands a
good view of the Dantaron Bight, which extends in all directions save south,
where passage is blocked by a dense grove of oak trees.

ruined watchtower stones~
The black stones comprising this tower look quite alien, particularly
when compared with the chalky white stone native to the downlands.  Once,
they appear to have been arranged into a watchtower, most likely placed here
to command the Dantaron Bight and the Arien Plains beyond, but the tower is
now truncated a mere twenty feet from the ground, either by catastrophe or
the relentless hand of time.

The Dantaron Bight~
Here, the Dantaron River deviates from its west-east course, bending
north to go around this low plateau.  Plains grass covers the plateau, but
gives way to cattails and reeds closer to the marshy ground just along the
riverbank.  Across the river, you can easily see the vast expanse of the
Arien Plains, and the towering Brintor mountains beyond it.  The river
itself flows immediately to the north, while the plateau extends east and
south.

A Fork in the Dantaron River~
The Dantaron River returns here to its easterly course on its way to the
Uthlin Ocean, but not before splitting.  The bulk of the water flows east,
but the Lithling Stream, its slow, wide distributary, turns south, running
through the vale bearing its name.  Far beyond the fork to the east, you can
just make out the dockyards to the west of Earendam.  Both rivers can be
reached to the north and east, while a low plateau stretches west and south.

A Gentle Slope~
The land here takes on a barely-perceptible slope south and east, away
from the plateau overlooking the Dantaron Bight.  The same plains grass
dominates the ground, well-adapted to the wide range of exposed earth.  To
the southwest, you can see the farms and rolling country of the Nendor
Downlands, with their great limestone hill visible far off to the west.  A
grove of oak trees can be reached to the west, but blocks passage to the
south.  To the east flows the Lithling Stream.

The Bank of the Lithling Stream~
Split from the Dantaron, this wide stream flows south through the
Lithling Vale.  Its slow speed has allowed the development of a thriving
strip of marsh on both its banks, full of cattails and orchids.  The
generally-flat ground slopes almost imperceptibly towards the river, with
the earth gradually getting muddier and muddier closer to the water.  The
stream itself flows to the east, and the ground slopes gently upwards to the
west.

This small field occupies a depression in the surrounding hills. 
Shielded from the sometimes-harsh winds through the hills, it has proven a
fertile environment for all manner of delicate flowers.  The rolling terrain
prevents you from looking very far in any direction, but treetops are
visible all around.  The meadow opens through a shallow gap between a pair
of hills to the east.

A Gap Between a Pair of Hills~
Between the hills to your north and south, this gap has formed a sort of
pass extending from a meadow to the west up to the top of a low ridge to the
east.  The wind is focused through this gap, eroding the soil to such a
degree that very little remains, with exposed rocks and gravel covering the
ground.  It is possible to pick your way over the rocks to the south.

the Aragol River in the west.  The ridge overlooks the vale of Lithling with
its wide stream to the east.  To the south, the ridge descends to lower,

A Grassy Hill~
This hill is covered with long, tenacious prairie grass, bending low with
each gust of the wind.  Geese can be seen and heard moving through the
grass, hunting for seeds.  The ground here is surprisingly firm, perhaps
owing to the density of grass roots just beneath the surface.  To the north
is a gap between this hill and the next, while the hill slopes away to
flatter land to the east and south.

The terrain here is strikingly flat when compared to the ridges and hills

north, and a hill to the west, while the Lithling Stream can be seen flowing
a distance to the east.

Jasa Lake is only a short distance to the south, and appears to be
encroaching on the soil.  Stagnant, boggy water conspires with the masses of

west, while the truly waterlogged beach of Jasa Lake is south.
