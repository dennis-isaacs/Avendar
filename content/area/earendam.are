Temple of the Stars~
You stand within the magnificent Temple of the Stars, the only temple in
all of Earendam which is open to all visitors.  Dedicated to neutrality and
balance, the temple is a haven for both the dark and light as they desire,
with none turned away.  The grey granite building seems to be hundreds of 
years old, yet magical arts - and expert masonry - have preserved it to 
excellent condition.  Candles line the walls on small stands, illuminating
the entire temple.  A small altar lies on the east wall.

purity, and it reflects it in every way.  It is kept pristine, and all the
small tables are covered in pure white cloth, as are the priests and
priestesses of the temple who are dressed in white robes.  Instead of a
stone ceiling there is a glass roof, allowing in the light from the sun,
and providing the need for very few candles and lamps.  A golden altar lies
to the north wall.

You stand upon a black cobblestone street leading to the Temple of
Demons, which is dedicated to the path of evil and cruelty.  The buildings
seem to lean closer to you, casting shadows upon most of the street, and
giving you an eerie feeling.  Spider webs are littered about in the corners
of the doorways of abandoned houses, or those which have occupants who seem
to enjoy the presence of them.

The Temple of Demons~
You stand within a decrepid old building, which is dimly lit by magical
torches spouting black flames, which seem to offer no heat and very little
illumination.  Shadows play on the walls and floor following you, and you
get the feeling you are being watched very closely.  Rats and other rodents
scurry about, and some bats hang from the ceiling; all seem to be welcome
here by the clientel.  A sense of evil permeates the temple, whose source
seems to be an obsidian altar against the west wall.

varios liquids are placed on a table on one wall, but very little else here
seems to be of worth.

several wagons and caravans with good for sale.  Throngs of merchants are
about hawking their useless wares and trinkets to anyone who will buy, at 
extremely inflated prices.  Upon the gates themselves there seems to be
some writing, but it is difficult to make it out.

a large fountain, and several stands are placed about with fruits and 
other such items for sale.

standing on the sidewalks call out loudly, hawking their wares to anyone
foolish enough to treat their trinkets as having any value.  Merchant Road
heads north and south from here, while Main Street intersects it, heading

Eastern Square~

Many farmers bring their wares in on horse-drawn carts through the east
gate, hoping to make a living on the fruits, vegetables and meat which they
sell.  Several peddlers stand along the side of the road begging for change,
and occasionally reaching out and grabbing what is exposed.  Main Street
continues both to the east and west.

of all possible descriptions pass through, many in a great hurry, going
about their business.  Merchant line the street hawking their wares to any
who will listen, and are foolish enough to be convinced the goods have any
value.  Eastern Square lies just to the west, and to the East is one of the
City Gates.

battlement which surrounds the city.  Travellers pass freely in and out of
the city, except for the occasional seedy character who is stopped by the
guards.  Wagons pass through bearing the goods of farmers, bound for the
markets.  To the east, you can follow the path out of town.

On the River Dantaron~
The river here seems quite dark, so much so that you cannot see more than
a few feet down.  No fish or aquatic life lives here, mostly due to the
pollution the dumping of the city\@s refuse causes the river, driving life
elsewhere.  A few boats travel along the river, many of them bearing cargo
to or from the city.  You can head out of Earendam to the west, or eastward
toward it\@s heart.

Under the Bridge~
You are standing under a bridge which runs along Haven Road, spanning
above the River Dantaron.  The strong iron girders support the bridge fully,
and the granite reinforcement which has stood for hundreds of years is
scratched and etched with various marking left over time.  The brown river
contains very little sealife, as it is the victim of dumping from most of
the city.  You can climb up to the street above, or follow the river to the
east or west.

On the River Dantaron~
This section of the river is darker than most, and it seemes to get
darker the farther west you go.  Very few fish live in the polluted waterway
which runs through the city of Earendam, which is not fit to drink from.  A
few small boats float along the river, heading east into town, and west out
of it.

On the River Dantaron~
The slow moving River Dantaron runs through the middle of Earendam,
splitting the city in a north and south half for much of the way.  The
luxurious northern section is divided from the rest of the city by the
river, which boasts little in the way of sea life, which avoid the polluted
waterway.  The river runs to the east, and to the west.

On the River Dantaron~
The slow moving River Dantaron which runs through Earendam is of a dark
colour, filled with the refuse from the city.  Little sealife inhabit the
river, and it is certainly not used for swimming or water sport.  The river
leads to the north, and to the west.

On the River Dantaron~
The dark waters of the river here lie relatively still, broken in places
by the few boats which travel along in in the middle of Earendam.  The boats
are relatively alone, however; there is little sealife to accompany them in
their journey, as the refuse dumped into the river from the city drives away
most of the life in the river.  You can follow the Dantaron north or south.

extravagant northern half of the city.  Almost no squatic life stirs within
the dark waters here, as it is driven to life elsewhere by the refuse which
the city has filled it with.  You can follow the river to the east, or to

On the River Dantaron~
The dark river Dantaron divides the northern and southern halves of
Earendam, keeping the lives of those living in the luxurious northern half
and those of the inhabitants residing in the poorer southern half apart. 
The river is devoid of life, as most of what would live within it has been
driven out of the city by the refuse dumped into the river.  You can go to
the east, or west.

of the largest city in the Realm, Earendam.  Little or no aquatic life can
be found within the river, as the dumping of refuse from the city has driven
it elsewhere.  The river can be followed either to the west, or to the east.

The River in the Tunnel~
The River Dantaron here narrows significantly from its width through most
of the city of Earendam, as it heads into the tunnel leading east from here.
The water here seems to be slightly more clear and clean that it is in most
of the city, and here and there you can see a few fish swimming about.  You
can follow the east bound tunnel, or head west into the city.

in other parts of Earendam.  The streets are clean and well kept, providing
you with a sense of home.  Citizen Street leads to the south, and Blood Road

Grave Road~
You are standing upon the jet black cobblestones which pave the Grave
Road, running east and west in the southern section of the city.  This part
of Earendam is somewhat less reputable than the northern half, as crime and
vagrancy run rampant.  The dirty walkways are a distinct contrast to the
impeccably clean Main Street, and are largely unattended by the city guard. 
You can follow Grave Road to the east, and the Southern Square lies just 
off to the west.

Bend on Grave Road~
You are standing upon the jet black cobblestones of Grave Road, where it
bends to the south in the eastern section of the city.  This part of the
city is quite dingy and dirty, and ill-kempt; the city guard even has little
presence here, for they leave the residents to fight among and fend for
themselves.  The dirty street leads west to the Southern Square, or east
where it turns again and heads for the Graveyard.

Bend on Grave Road~
You are standing upon the jet black cobblestones of Grave Road, where it
bends to the east.  This part of the city is dingy and ill-kempt, and the
trim white-washed buildings of the northern half are a infinitely far from
here.  The residents are left to fight among themselves and fend without the
help of the city guard, who want nothing to do with such wretches.  Grave
Road leads to the east toward the Graveyard, or to the north.

Grave Road~
You are standing on the jet black cobblestones of the Grave Road, in the
south-east corner of Earendam.  This is truly a wretched place, as litter
and refuse is strewn about the streets, and the residents do not take enough
care to keep it clean.  Violence is commonplace as people fight among
themselves, and the city guard keeps little to do with this portion of the
city, believing it beyond hope.  The Grave Road leads to the west, or to the
Graveyard, to the east.

Grave Road under the Battlements~
The jet black cobblestone street known as Grave Road here passes under
the Battlement in the south-eastern portion of the city, on it\@s route to
the run-down Cemetary.  Solid granite stairs lead up to the battlements high
above, but are beginning to crumble with age and lack of care.  The Grave
Road leads to the west, and the Graveyard Gate is just to the east.

Graveyard Gate~
The obsidian gates to the old Graveyard in Earendam truly are a chilling
sight.  Carved by an ancient hand, aided by powerful magics, the gates
manage to send a chill down your spine.  Skulls are etched within the
obsidian, hundreds of years old.  A small etching is noticeable upon one of
the gates, faded but legible.  You can go into the graveyard to the east, or
follow Grave Road to the west.

Outside the Northern Gates~
You are standing outside the Northern Gate of Earendam, the largest city
in the known realm.  Many passerby go in and out of the gate, giving a
tremendously varied cross-section of the diverse population held within the
city walls.  Merchants and farmers, adventurers and miscreants pass under
the granite wall that guards the city, many passing without notice of you. 
The cobblestones are well worn from the feet of those who head north out of
the city, and south into it.

along the streets, merchants attempting to take advantage of the ignorant
passerby coming into the city from the north.  The North Gate is just to the

Merchant Road over the Bridge~
Youa re standing upon the cobblestones of Market Road, where it leads
over the River Dantaron.  The sturdy bridge is centuries old, and it\@s rail
is engraved with runes of some sort; perhaps for protection, perhaps for
enhancement, or perhaps script to be handed down over the ages.  Shops like
the Merchant Road to the north and south of here, and some are out on the
bridge hawking their wares.

beyond the understanding of mortals being invoked in the practices of
sorcery.  The scholars learn to use the elements of Fire, Water, Earth, Air,
Spirit and Void to perform feats that would normally be impossible.  Blood
Road lies just to the north, or you can enter the guild to the south.

You are standing within the hall of the Scholar\@s Guild, which is a
bustle of activity.  Members of the guild head in all directions, carrying
papers, books, and other magical objects with them, often reading as they
go.  The high domed ceiling is inlaid with small bulbs of magical light,
which illuminate the hallway without creating any heat.  There are doors to
both the north and the south, created from ancient oak.  To the east is the
Hall of the Elements, where the scholars practice their arts.  You can leave
the guild to the north.

Alchemist\@s Laboratory~
You are standing in an incredibly ill-kept room.  A long, narrow table
stands in the middle of it, holding a rack full of beakers, filled with
various substances.  Some of the vials and beakers have smoking liquids,
some are bubbling, and some are shaking so violently you think they may
explode.  A large book lies open on the table also, which is presumably a
magical cookbook of sorts.  The oak door to the north leads out into the
Hallway.

sage works for all the scholars who are a members of the guild.  The room is
lined with oak bookcases which are filled with old tomes, many of which are
covered with a thick layer of dust and have obviously not been touched in
some time.  A large mahogany desk stands in the other end of the room,
littered with various papers, sketches and notes left by a neat hand.  You
can head back into the hall to the east.

The room here could be called an arena for Sorcerors, where they perfect
their magics, often against one another in duels of sorts.  Inlaid in the
stone floor is a diagram of a circle with six points in it; one red, one
blue, one white, one black, one brown, one clear, and in the middle is a
grey stone which rises out of the stone floor.  The room is sparsely
decorated - likely to reduce losses - and is lighted with magical sources,
which give off bright light, but no heat.  You can head into the hall to the
west.

men-at-arms who are loyal to others of their profession rest, socialize, and
hone their skills.  This foyer is decorated with great pomp, as regal
colours adorn the walls and door, inlaid gold glistening in the light.  You
can leave the guild to the south, or tread farther within to the north.

men-at-arms meet to rest, train, and discuss issues of import.  The gilded
hallway bears many exotic weapons along its walls, beside murals and
paintings of the great battles of history.  Several well-muscled men and
women walk the hallway here, all bearing arms, and all of which look very
dangerous.  The Forge where many weapons are created is to the north, and a
conference room is to the east.  An Arena lies westward, and the guild can
be left to the south.

The Old Forge~

blacksmith, used for creating weapons and armor for use in battle by the
warriors of the guild; for a price.  Pieces of scrap metal are littered
across the floor, on and near a large anvil in the center of the room.  A
large fire on the far wall sends tendrils of smoke up a chimney, and beads
of sweat drip down your face.  A large door exits to the south.

maps.  More maps can be found in holders lining the walls, and books full of
military tactics line bookshelves.  Ceremonial armour can be found lining
the walls, along with some finely crafted weapons.  A door leads out to the

wall, used to practice.  Several different suits and types of armor can also
be found about the large, domed room, available for usage by the members of
the guild.  A huge passage leads out to the east, into the main area of the
guild.

of musicians practicing their craft, and can even catch glimpses of gleemen
practicing acrobatic tricks.  This is the guild for the jack of all trades,
the master of the performing arts, and the trickster on the street corner. 
From all walks of life the members of this guild have come forth, to perform
for the masses.  You can enter to the north, or leave to the south.

Within the Entertainers Guild~
The entertainer\@s guild is a vibrant place, bustling with activity. 
People head to and fro at a rapid pace, carrying instruments and piles of
parchment, many of which are lined with musical notes.  People recite
speeches to themselves, sing songs to small groups, and relate stories,
practicing their art.  To the north is a stage which can be booked by any
member of the guild, and to the south you can leave.  A hallway leads
westward toward some quieter areas.

stories, songs and poems in front of an audience, so that they can judge how
the public will react.  The quality of performers is quite varying, with
some seeming to teem with life, and others being fairly dull.  Several
tables stand in front of the stage for those who wish to listen to the
performers.  You can leave to the south.

room used for quiet study, and the main area of the guild lies to the east.

comfortable chairs, scribbling madly.  Others seem to be engorged in books
or scripts, studying their merits in hopes to improve their own skill.  You
can leave the room to the east, through the large oaken door.

The Entrance to the Guild of Shadows~
The buildings nearby seem to block out all light from reaching this
portion of the street.  The moisture in the air creates a thin fog, making
it hard to see in front of you.  Instead of cobblestone, the street here is
made from sandstone.  It is apparently effective; shades of people melt into
and appear from the fog without making a single sound.  Only those who have
learned to live in the shadows may continue to the north.

tables sit along the wall, complete with delicate flowers and handmade
vases.  A few fine portraits hang on the wall, adding to the hall\@s
ambiance.  The sounds of conversation and laughter come to you from the
north, and the entrance into the guild lies directly to the south.

The very heard of the guild is a meeting ground of sorts.  The founders
of the guild spared no expense in furnishing this room.  A glass chandeiler
hangs from the ceiling, holding serveral white candles.  Its fuction seems
more for beauty than anything else.  Elegant brass oil lamps stand in each
corner of the room to create its gentle light.  Several tables are scattered
around the room, and a red, plush couch rests against the northernmost wall.
A silver plated sign hangs above the room to the east, while a brass plated
one rests on the doorframe of the western room.  A private resturant for
esteemed members of the rogue community awaits to the north.

The Bandit Hall~
A rowdy laughter fills your ears as you enter the bandit\@s training room.
Thick smoke hangs in the air, making it hard to breath and harder still to
see.  Bandits of every size and order fill the room.  The guild is an
apparent off shoot of the Paper Crane; a mediocre tavern, but a tavern all
the same.  The carpet is stained with what appears to be blood and ale, and
the ceiling remains perminitely black from the smoke.  Knife holes line the
walls and the tables.

The Room of Thieves~
A few couches and chairs lie along the east wall for comfort, and a
large, glass coffeetable spans in front of them all.  Barmaids wander in and
out, serving the guildmembers and leaving as quickly as possible.  The soft
carpet gives way to a creaky hardwood floor.  The shadows of the room shift
every few moments, as the light changes.  A pile of stuffed dummies of all
shapes, sizes and races lies on the ground in a corner to be put into use as
the need arises.  The meeting hall lies back to your east, as the only exit.

The Paper Crane~
This restaurant exudes elegance.  The tables are adorned with silver
candles and a large paper crane basket that carries red roses and baby\@s
breath.  Blood red table cloths spill gracefully from the table tops and
brush lightly against the black carpet.  In the far front of the room is a
small stage and a piano.  Only the best of the local talents could hope to
perform here.  Paintings by the masters hang on the walls in gold and silver
frames.  Clearly there was no expense spared.  The only exit from the paper
Crane is south, back into the meeting hall.

Entrance to the Templar\@s Guild~
A polished marble walkway replaces the cobblestones, leading into the
guild of the Templars.  The noise from the street seems to hush near this
building, almost out of respect.  Every so often a person will wander in or
out, entralled in a book, or still practicing the latest move their
guildmaster has taught them.  Only those who follow the path of the Templar
could ever hope to see what lies to the south.  To the north, is east main
street.

extravagent by any means.  The walls have been painted a soft blue-green,
and the marble floor beneath your feet is an elegant shade of pearl.  A few
plain wood chairs are scattered here and their, but for the most part this
hall is empty.  The hallway branches out east and west from here, east
leading deeper into the building and west

The Main Hall~
The soft blue-green hall turns darker here, and is replaced by a rich
navy and forest green pattern.  This room is a bit more decorative; a large
silver rimmed mirror fills most of the north wall.  The chairs and tables
are oriented so that no matter where you are you can see yourself.  The soft
chant of magicks being spoken and harsh sound of swords being crossed, dully
reaches your ears from the south and east.

designated towards study.  The west is the only exit from this study room.

The Library~
The air is heavy with burning insense with the purpose of calming those
who enter here of their tension.  Books are scattered about, half-open on
the floor.  The majority of the books and scrolls, however, in order on the
shelves built into the wall.  A globe of the entire world sits by the center
of the south wall, on a black, steel stand.  Behind the globe is a giant
world map, with the major cities and towns of Avendar painted purple.  To
the north, you can see glimpses of the giant mirror in the main hall.

A Study~
A large bookshelf spans three walls of this room and stretches up as high
as the ceiling itself.  The wood looks worn with time, but is polished and
dusted to perfection.  The floor is hardwood, with a large circle drawn in
the center of the room.  Little markings for foot and body placement are
scattered througout the inside of the circle.  Along the empty wall wall are
weapons of all various sizes and weights to practice with.  In a far corner
there is even a sofa and a few chairs to relax in.  To the east you can see
the hall that brought you into the guild study.

Entrance to the Whistling Wind Inn~
You are standing at the entrance to the Whistling Wind, the finest Inn in
all of Earendam.  The well kept, thatch-roofed building appears to be in
good condition, and it\@s recent paint job proves it has not been neglected. 
Above the door hangs a wooden sign of a tree, whose leaves are rustling in
the wind; underneath it is the name of the Inn.  You can enter the common
room to the north.

The Common Room of the Whistling Wind~
You are within the common room of the Whistling Wind.  Numerous tables
are scattered about, each having a few chairs at them.  Close to the bar is
a small stage, for performers to provide live entertainment for the patrons,
many of which seem to flirt with the well-behaved waitresses who serve them.
To the west is a small hallway, and the staircase leading upward is to the
east.  You can head north and take a seat at the bar.

At the Bar of the Whistling Wind~
You are standing at the bar to the Whistling Wind, the finest Inn in all
of Earendam.  Here you can order any drink you so desire, from the Faerie
Sprinkler that can be found to the north, to the heavy malt so loved by the
Alatharya.  Some patrons seem to lounge at the bar, occupying some of the
stools; others seem deeply occupied by their beverages.  Oddly, none are at
all out of hand.  The kitchen is through a door to the north, and the dining
room to the west.  You can head into the common room to the south.

A Narrow Hallway~
The narrow hallway in the Whistling Wind connects the common room and the
stables, and is generally used by those who leave their mounts to be tended
and are seeking a warm bed for the night.  The floor is well swept, and the
few paintings on the wall are hung straight.  You can head to the stables to
the west, or into the common room to the east.

The Dining Room~
This private dining room in the Whistling Wind is generally used by the
more affluent guests when they wish to have a private meal, or a
conversation meant not for the ears of the public.  A long wooden table
dominates the room, lined with well-upholstered chairs.  On the western
wall is an oaken bookshelf filled with leatherbound tomes, many of which
don\@t seem to have been stirred in an eon.  You can head back into the open
area of the inn to the east.

The Bottom of the Stairwell~
You are standing at the base of the oaken stairwell in the Whistling
Wind, the finest Inn in all of Earendam.  The bannister seems age-old but is
still sturdy, and bears the inscriptions of long-forgotten characters upon
it, which have long since faded into obscurity.  You can head out into the
common room to the west, or head up to the bedrooms.

inscribed upon it some etchings; they seem vaguely farmiliar, but are
impossible to make out.  You can follow the short hallway either north or
west, or head down the staircase.

The Kitchen in the Whistling Wind~
The kitchen of the Whistling Wind is a hectic place, as cooks and
waitresses head to and fro, trying to satisfy the customers.  The smell of
fried potatoes can be detected very strongly, along with the scents of many
other delicacies.  A row of ovens lines the east wall, and you can head out
to the bar to the south.

scent of hay, bundles of which are stored in the rafters to feed the horses
of the patrons of the Inn.  Large wooden stalls, some empty and some not,
line the northern wall of the stables, all neatly kept.  You can head out
onto the street to the south, or into the inn to the east.

Entrance to the Growling Tiger~
The front step of the Growling Tiger is made of stone, and has seen
better days.  Cracked and crumbling, it seems better than the door to the
Inn, which is nearly falling off its hinges.  The sound of loud voices come
from inside the Inn, drowning out what seems to be a mediocre musician of
some sort.  You can head into the inn to the south, or out to the north.

The Growling Tiger is a dingy, run-down Inn.  The patrons seem boisterous
and crude, and cocasionally you can hear a shouting match between a few of
them.  The waitresses are constantly being yelled at by the customers,
regardless of how hard they work.  You can leave the Growling Tiger to the
north, or head inside to the south.

The Bar of the Growling Tiger~
The bar of the Growling Tiger is more decrepid than most of the rest of
the Inn.  The stools are all in a state of disrepair, and the solid wood bar
has chips taken out of it, and rings from drink glasses have been stained
into it.  Waitresses go back and forth, most of them seeming in grumpy
moods.  The bartender is terse and not at all chatty, and the clientel
either keep to themselves, or are rowdy and abrasive.  A stairwell is just
to the east of here, and the kitchen to the west.  You can head into the
common room to the north.

The Kitchen of the Growling Tiger~
The kitchen of the Growling Tiger isn\@t one that any self-respecting cook
would be proud of.  It is dirty and grimy, with dust and other unnamed
substances found all over the place.  The floor is covered with dirt tracked
in off the street, and spills which haven\@t been cleaned up.  The sight of
the kitchen could make one wish to reconsider eating here.  You can leave to
the east.

step.  A few even shift out of place as weight is put on them, creating a
not too safe environment.  A ragged carpet trails up the twisted staircase
in a vain attempt of decoration.  The stairs twist up to the rooms of the
Growling Tiger, while west leads into the bar.

hallway.  The plaster of the walls falls off in large chunks, and a large
hole takes the place of a final step.  North leads to the rooms of the
Growling Tiger, or you can chance the stairway once again to reach the bar
by leaving down.

The hallway of the Growling Tiger is nothing that would attract patrons
of any stature.  The floorboards creak loudly as you walk, and the pain on
the walls is chipped and coming off.  There are no decorations on the walls
save small candleholders which are rusted and falling apart.  You can follow
the hall southward to the staircase, or go through the door to the west.

floor has not been kept clean, and the small lavaratory off to the side
would turn the stomach of most.  The door leads out to the east.

Entrance to the Brothel~
The building before you is easily the largest on this side of the city. 
A thick, heavy black door separates the inside of the building from the rest
of the world.  A few women hang around outside, displaying their own wares
as a healthy alternative to what lays inside, but the attention they gather
is little.  The door to the north leads inside the brothel, and south takes
you back out onto Grave Road.

Inside the Brothel~
A small line of men lean casually against the wall, sending a few
impatient glances towards the stairs.  The servers and maids that do pass
through here do so with great haste, hurrying up the stairs to the east. 
With fresh bedsheets or bottles of wine.  Drunken laughter roars up every
now and again to the north while not a sound can be heard from the upstairs.

The Bar in the Brothel~
Laughter fills the air and harrassed barmaids walk the room, serving the
patrons of the bar with forced smiles.  Tables are scattered across the
room, made from a bright cherry wood.  With the exception of a few burn and
scratch marks, they are in a rather good condition.  If one looked closely
they could even see that ivy had been carved around the face of the table. 
The large bar counter is made from pure ebony, and is strangely unmarred in
any way.  Back to the south is the main hall of the brothel.

down the stairs.  A quiet hallway lies to the west, and you can hear a faint
drunken laughter coming from downstairs.

Servers hurrying back and forth, supplying the rooms with all the wine

remains quiet.  A few simple paintings hang on the wall, but aside from
those, the hallway is quite barren.  A gold, silk curtain covers the archway
to the north that leads into one of the private rooms.

Miriyana\@s Room~
Mirrors line the walls and ceiling of this room so that your reflection
can be seen from every angle imaginable.  A small pit lies at the far wall
of the room, upon closer inspection, you find that it is really a bed that\@s
been built into the floor.  The carpet, and what little wall space that is
left un-mirrored is as dark as midnight.  Strung beads cover the doorway to
the south, making a gentle rattle as anyone enters or exits.

Imandra\@s Room~
The entire room seems to be oriented around a large, circular bed that
rests in its center.  The bed seems almost as big as the room itself,
adorned with little red and gold pillows.  A thin screen of silk cascades
from the ceiling and forms a ring around the bed, offering some privacy,
albeit, very little.  To match the bed, the carpet is red with flecks of
gold scattered about.  It is exceptionally thick and plush, for any of
Imandra\@s impatient customers.  A heavy scent of perfume hangs in the air of
this room, one that could easily be overpowering and nauseating.  A thick
curtain to the east hangs over the archway that leads back into the hall.

Nadiya\@s Room~
A light, exotic insence tickles your nose as you enter this room.  A
small stage is set up on the west side of the room for Nadiya to dance upon.
A little walk way leads from the stage to a pile of soft, satin cushions
that wait patiently across the room.  The only light in this room comes from
the gentle glow of candles placed about the room in ornate holders.  Bamboo
cages hang around the room, housing elegant looking songbirds that sing
strange, hauntingly beautiful melodies.  A gold, silk curtain covers the
archway to the south, that leads into the hall.

The Butcher Shop~
The butcher shop of Earendam is absolutely spotless.  A large counter at
the far end of the small store it lined with several butcher\@s knives and
other tools used by the tradesman, and several different cuts of meat hang
on the back wall, and are packed in ice.  The shop is a very busy one, as
the good reputation of the butcher as a fair tradesman is well known.  You
can exit the shop onto Haven Road, to the west.

The Bakery~
The smell of fresh bread permeates your senses here, in the bakery. 
Severeal well-used ovens line the back wall of the shop, and a man seems to
merrily go between them, paying attention to all of his products.  The
shelves on either side of the store are lined with loaves of bread, cakes,
and several sweets.  You can leave the bakery to the west, where Haven Road
lies.

The Candle store~
Little beads of wax dot the floor of the shop, some of the wax forming
into solid pools on the wooden floor.  The room in made so that no natural
light could creep in from inside, only the gentle glow of the candles
illuminates the room.  A few strings of wicks hang against the wall, along
with some new unfinished candles.  A large kettle of wax sits below the
candles on a small fire.  The wax bubbles slightly, making a faint gurgling
sound.  At the far corner of the room is a large oak counter for the shop
keeper.  A small abacus sits on the counter, beside a small metal strongbox.

The Crematorium~
Perhaps the most morose store in all of Earandam, the Crematorium offers
an alternative to burying in an expensive coffin.  Ritual urns line shelves
to either side of the shop, and heat seems to emenate from the back of the
store, where a huge oven is kept.  You can leave onto Grave Road to the
north.

The Coffin Shop~
You are standing within one of the most morbid shops in all of Earendam:
the Coffin Shop.  Several well crafted oaken coffins are placed about the
room to show off to wealthy customers, made of various types of wood.  The
shop seems quiet, and somewhat morbid; the walls are painted dark colours,
and the dark stains on the wood seem to make it seem smaller than it is. 
You can exit southward onto Grave Road.

The low building that is the forge is warmed emmensely from the head of
the cast-iron stove in the near the back, used for melting metals to be used
in weapons.  Two large anvils stand near the center of the room, and next to
them several molds used for shaping the metals.  Along the walls hang
several examples of the craft of the vendor, and affixed are tags listing
their respective prices.  You can exit the shop to the west.

The extravagance of this shop is enormous, as suits of seemingly ancient
and invaluable armor line the walls, some dressed upon wooden dummies. 
Armour made of copper, steel, brass and even iron is strewn about the shop,
and parts from breastplaces to helms, to shin guards and gauntlets can be
found about; or ordered specially, for a price.

places in all of the city.  The countertop behind which the tellers work is
inlaid with gold, and the floor is made of solid marble.  Several people can
be found here during business hours, as this is the only reliable bank in
the city.  You can leave to the west.

Entrance to the Library~
You stand upon the grandiose steps leading into the libary of Earendam,
the oldest of such buildings in this part of the world.  Several scribes
enter in and out of the library, and it is surprisingly quiet for the number
of people who seem to be making use of it.  The steps lead to the south, and
Blood Road awaits to the north.

newer books, as compared to some of those in the back which have collected a
thin layer of dust.  Magical bulbs of light are placed around the room,
posing no threat to the parchments and volumes held here.  You can head into
a quieter room to the west, or leave the library to the north.

in which many of the animal pelts are being soaked.  Life-like recreations
of rabbits, boars, deer, moose and anteloupe are on display around the shop,
as well as those of such regal birds as the hawk, eagle, and owl.  Not a
very busy shop, the taxidermist does extravagant work, and charges
accordingly.  You can leave to the south.

gowns and bridal dresses are being displayed on mannequins, and you can see
several women working on even more dresses in the back of the shop.  You can
leave to the north.

both new and used volumes to those who can afford the large prices on such a
commodity.  There are some chairs around the store for customers to peruse
the goods, and a small desk in the back for the proprietor.  You can leave

cares enough to keep them clean.  Small houses can be seen to the north and
south which are nearly as run-down as the street.  They are dimly lit, as is
the alley.  You can follow the alley westward, or go onto Merchant Road to
the east.

Earendam\@s preformance hall.  The two large, oak doors are decorated
beautifully; Ivy is carved around the sides of each door, and a
stained-glass rose sits in the center of each.  The world\@s elite gather
here for the great concerts preformed by Avendar\@s greatest bards and
orchestras.  North leads into this monument of music, and south leads back
into the common riff-raff.

A silver and gold gate bars the public from entering the Performance Hall

path to these doors are six ebony ticket booths.  Large glass chandieliers
hang from the ceiling, glittering like diamonds.  The walls are slick and
made from marble like the floor.  A long purple carpet trails from the door
deep into the Hall.

Two staircases spiral up from the floor to the entrance into the chamber
hall to the north.  To the west is a somewhat less dramatic-looking door.

with peeling boarded floors and some liquid dripping down from the ceiling.
