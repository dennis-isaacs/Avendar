the foreman~
The foreman of the Earendam city workers is here.
~
This large, hardy man has dirt and grime in every crease of his person,
from his calloused hands to his ears.  His regulation coveralls, embossed
with the Earendam crest, have become so filthy and faded that you can barely
tell they once were a classic, noble blue.

shuddeni templar sinister mob_5808~
a shuddeni templar~
A sinister looking shuddeni glides through the night with dark, fluid robes trailing behind him.
~
This shuddeni stalks about with what seems like a cruel smile etched on
his face.  Lengthy scars curve from the edges of his mouth, the left side
forking midway up his cheek.  He twitches periodically and mutters to
himself in an angered tone as if playing out some tortured moment from his
past.

Northern Outskirts of Earendam~
Beyond the bare ground of the city walls begin the Grasslands of
Earendam, a vast sea of green vegetation that stirs and whispers softly in
the breeze.  The long Earendam grasses grow to your waist, and so densely as
to slow progress through the area.  The walls of the city Earendam are
visible nearby to the south.

Beyond the east walls of the city, a bare plain extends into the

and to the north and south of the city stretch the Earendam Grasslands.  
Now and then a breeze carries the distant smell of saltwater from the east.

The Earendam Road~
A narrow strip of stones that leads north into the grasslands, the
Earendam Road was once heavily travelled by caravans trading with the
mountain outposts to the north.  It has since fallen into disuse, but is
still nominally maintained by Earendam.
