Qaranstan~
Qaranstan, the leader of Eril, sits here, going over some papers.
~
The leader of Eril is an elderly ethron, his pale green skin wrinkled and
grayish in his age.  But though his body is giving up to the ravages of
time, his gaze remains clear and focused, and sparkling with intelligence.

Lerin trim ethron man erilshop~
Lerin~
A trim ethron man works in his shop.
~
Lerin is an ethron merchant of some repute, and the current owner of the
Eril clothing shop.  Originally born in Lithling Valley, he has traveled
extensively throughout Avendar.  He is trim and handsome, with a pleasant
face and deep, brown eyes.  His natural charisma gave him an advantage in
breaking into the clothing trade, and his sensibilities appealed to the
near-untapped ethron market.  This success allowed him to negotiate with the
Var Bandor\@s Merchant Council, and secure the materials and patterns his
clients wanted.  He set up shop in Eril to indulge his passion for clothing
and also be among his people.

Alajasi Chadirsa~
A caladaran artisan with large hands tends his shop.
~
The caladaran artisan Alajasi Chadirsa is well-known throughout Avendar
for his ceramics.  Originally born in Jandiska, he traveled abroad to study
with Chassalrin, the famed sculptor of Gaald.  He is tall and thin, with
almost comically oversized hands and feet for his frame.  His somewhat odd
appearance has worked in his favor, allowing him an unusually impressive
command of sculpting.  His work is most well known for the geometric forms
with which he decorates his pieces.  He was able to procure this location at
low cost from its previous owner, and now uses it to expand both his art and
coin-purse.

A short ethron man sits under a nearby tree, playing music and singing.

The man is short, even for an ethron, and his build is more fragile than
those of his race tend to be.  As he sings and plays music for those who

The jam-maker, Yilmiras, has her hair pulled back in thick, grey braids. 
Her face is wrinkled with laugh lines around her mouth and eyes, but the
years seem to have treated her well.  She seems a bit chubby, and her
fingers are stained various shades of red and purple from the berries she
works with day to day, but a perpetual smile keeps her from seeming worn.

painted ceramic bracelet thick~
a painted ceramic bracelet~
A thick ceramic bracelet painted with geometric forms is here.~
The style of this bracelet\@s shape and paint are typical of the caladaran
artistic aesthetic, which prizes simplistic shapes and abstract forms.  It
was shaped by hand rather than by magic, its subtle imperfections giving it
a genuineness that magically-shaped jewelry can never fully possess.  Many
caladaran appreciate such style, as the creator can find peace in its
creation as well as enjoy the product of their labor.

woven around one another.  They come together at what looks to be a small
seed, forming a living loop.  The smooth, supple sprouts seem to be
nourished by the magic of the seed that binds them.

The Belliful Tavern is a busy place, set inside a beautiful old oak tree.
The tavern looks as if it has grown with the tree, rather than killing it,
and the polished bar along the north wall seems a natural extension of the
tree itself.  Many of the people of Eril come here to socialize and drink,
and the room echoes with voices and laughter.  A door to the west leads to a
small hallway, and the bar continues up a wide staircase, and to the south.

The part of the tavern has a few tables, but the prime attraction seems
to be a few painted wood dart boards set against the south wall.  A woven

would not stab the tree though houses the tavern.  The comfortable, homey
feeling of the inn still prevades this part of the room, and the atmosphere
is light and easy-going.  The main entrance to the tavern lies to the north,

A Small Home~
The small home is clean and well-furnished, with sturdy wooden furniture
and a few odds and ends.  A thick rug covers the floor, and the only
illumination seems to come from the window out to the street.  There is a
pleasant smell in the air, a combination of berries and pine.  A door leads
north back to the road.

The Town Hall~
The town hall is quiet, well insulated so as to stop the noise from
outside.  Many chairs have been left in rows, all facing north towards a
small raised platform.  The town hall is seldom used as not many troubles
plague the village, and the chairs seem to be growing a bit dusty.  A set of
double doors leads south to the road.

The Market~
You stand by the edge of the market, a bustling part of Eril Village
where the merchants and traders show their wares.  The ground is packed
dirt, bits of grass poking up here and there, but for the most part it is
bare from the travel of so many feet.  The market continues to the east,
north and south, and the main road leads into a cluster of homes to the

The Market~
The market bustles with energy, being a combination of a trading place
for the merchants and trappers, and a park for people to rest in, and relax.
Patches of soft grass invite those wearied to rest, and enjoy the spectacle
of the rest of the people buying and trading.  The market continues on to
the north and east, each way leading to the road.

The market is at the busiest here, in the center.  People move to and fro
among the merchants, admiring the fine skins brought by the trappers, and
the new items from the city that the merchants carry.  A soft breeze and the
cooling splash of the water from the fountain help keep down dust, and the
patches of soft grass offer a place to rest a moment before continuing on.

and the merchants who visit greet them warmly as well, hoping to get the
pick of the furs before they reach Var Bandor.  The market continues to the

Lerin\@s Forest Fashions~
A small but attractive store, Lerin\@s clothing shop has a prominent place
in Eril\@s marketplace.  Various articles of clothing are displayed
throughout, showing off a variety of fabrics and styles.  These are not the
common items of the average citizen, though; instead they are expensive
works of art from one of the few masters of the ethron race.  A small wooden
counter sits at the back of the store, with much of the shop\@s interior left
in the well-worn, homey style of the village.  The shop is cool through much
of the year, even during the summer, and the room is well ventilated to
prevent stuffiness.  To the north is the rest of Eril\@s market.

The Jandiskan Kiln~
This store has store has been refitted to support a large kiln and other
pottery-related periphernalia.  It has been expanded, upward as well as
outward, and painted in a rich, earthy orange-brown.  The west wall supports
two respectable windows which flank its familiar doorway, giving the shop
interior a healthy amount of natural light.  The scent of the kiln and its
heat fill the room, giving it a heavier feel during the summer months and a
thick warmth during the winter.  A series of small counters provide places
for transactions to take place, as well as examples of the wares for sale. 
Outside to the west is Eril\@s marketplace.

Barrels are lined up by the northern wall, the tops lie askew to reveal the
contents as yeast, barley, and hops.  A rickety staircase leads downward

The field is encircled on three sides by the forest, making the area

seem to be doing well.  The crop seems evenly divided between barley and
hops, the barley growing in the more shady sections of the field.  To the

to give any light.  On the far side of the room is a line of large barrels,
filled about half-way full with a translucent milky liquid.  A yellowish
foam coats the liquid, clinging wetly to the sides of the barrels.  Aside
from the staircase leading upwards to the brewery, there are no other exits

Yilmiras\@ Jam Shop~
The shop is built within an old, hollowed out tree, which grows still
around the tiny establishment.  Small racks are set up around the room,
lined with jars of jam, each stoppered with white wax that is stamped with
the jam-makers seal.  A large counter dominates the rear of the room, and on
it are a few coloured bowls and glass vials used in the jam making process. 
Various pots are at a low boil in the area behind the counter, most with
water, but a couple seem to be brewing something else.  A small red rug
muffles the steps of patrons in the store, and a few live plants adorn the
room.  A door opens up to the south, leading to Eril\@s marketplace, and a
small ladder leads upstairs.

A Small Room~
This room is tiny, but well-built, allowing space for a dresser and a
large bed nestled against the eastern wall.  The walls are decorated with
prints of colourful flowers, and the whole room has a very cozy feel.  From
here, it is easy to glance down into the main area of the shop, while in any
part of the room.

An Entrance to Eril Village~
Two tall, majestic trees are on either side of the pathway leading south
into the village.  The oaks look ancient and strong, their wide trunks many
paces across.  The ground is packed hard from the passage of visitors in and
out, edged by scrubby grass.  The path winds north into the trees, and south
into the village itself.
