the basalt guardian~
A lone figure hewn from basalt stands here, its stony face devoid of any features.
~
Carved from pure basalt, this figure stands a full seven feet in height. 
An aura of power seems to shimmer about it, accentuating the natural force
of its movements.  Neither particularly fast nor slow, the being seems to
move methodically, wasting little effort.  Its rocky countenance is devoid
of all features; where the face would be, there is only smooth stone.

An obsidian staff inset with a diamond gleams darkly here.~
Though the true origins of this particular staff are steeped in mystery,
many suspect it was originally forged by the ancient alatharyan magi
themselves, in the days before the Sundering.  Critics of this theory note
that while it is certainly true that those scholars had an unparalleled
mastery of magic and could easily have forged such a piece, they would not
have been likely to squander their time on what, for them, would have been a
trivial forging.  

Regardless of the truth of its creation, it is known that sometime around
the War of Night the staff fell into the hands of the archmage Ankern
Earthblight, before his eventual defeat and exile into the boglands at the
base of the Mlejians.  It remained with him there while he rebuilt his
power, and was presumed lost to the marsh after he was once again repelled.

silvery bracer pain-drinking pain drinking barbs~
a silvery bracer of pain-drinking~
A silvery bracer with barbs at its edges lies here.~
It is said that when a mystical metal fell from the sky, two groups of
scholars set upon it, each finding it and the others at the same time.  The
first was a group of rigid dedicants of earth, void and law.  The second was
a primal conclave of chaos fire and spirit.  Knowing that no side could
easily best the other, they agreed to work in concert upon the precious
alloy from the stars.  

So in turn, each worked their craft upon the bracer.  Secretly, each party
wove magics to foil the other into the bracer they had forged until their
artifact was a mighty proof against many attacks.  The bracer twisted many
of the magics of void, earth and fire, empowering its wearer even as they
suffered through the affects of the maledictions.  

When each side learned of what the other had done, it was war.  The bracer
changed hands many times, tipping the balance of the conflict each time,
before it disappeared.  Rumors speak that it fell into the hands of a
tyrant-lord who once ruled the area now known as the Fens, ages past.

My mortal servants turn even as my serfs do, my warriors are overwhelmed

Sunderers of Chains.  Do these fools not realize that the chains they so
eupemistically break are the very things that hold this world together?  It
is no matter, Tal-Pui-Nir shall allow them to savor no victory.  

If this land is not ruled by Tal-Pui-Nir, let no man hold dominion over it. 
I shall crack the Alatharya artifact whose very power I have so skillfully
manipulated.  Let the rune-engine shatter and bring a second sundering to
this land.  It matters not, if I cannot have it.  Let those who rose against
me know the ultimate consequence of their actions with a searing finality. 
Though it may mean my end, I shall rest easy knowing that my deathless
guardians hold vigil over my most precious artifacts.  Those who would seek
the power of Tal-Pui-Nir shall find only their tomb.

The rabble is roused and gathered at the gates.  Roused to action, no
doubt, by those zealous insurrectionists who offer madness under the guise
of freedom.  Do they not understand the freedom offered by Tal-Pui-Nir?  A
freedom from chance, from distraction.  They speak of freedom when they hold
the crowds in their thrall and whip them into a towering bloodthirst.  What
do they hope to accomplish?  To usurp this rightful rule before the Black
Throne?  To invoke fear?  No.  Fear, like compassion, like mercy, is for
lesser men.  Never for Tal-Pui-Nir.  

I shall go and quell this mob and its mewling masters.  Let them know the
shame of fear, and the glory of submission.

basalt heavy casket monstrance obj_22592~
This heavy reliquary is carved from a cube of blackish grey basalt stone.
Squat, clawed feet support the plinthlike base, and an overhang of stone
runs around the top.  Ziggurats and pyramids are raised in low relief on all
four sides, with an obelisk displayed prominently on the front.  The top is
the most interesting side by far.  A cylinder has been built into the top,
sunk so as to show only a small section.  A raised flange holds the cylinder
in place.  The cylinder itself is made from eleven marble disks, carved from
pale white stone.  Each disk appears to rotate freely from the others. 
Letters adorn the surfaces of the disks, each separated by a notch.  Were
one so inclined, one might be able to rotate the disks and {ydial{n a word
into the cylinder.  

A harshly-carved inscription scars the stone above the cylinder.

obelisk~
The obelisk carved on the front of the casket is tall and pointed, yet
the proportions are somehow inexplicably squat.  Tiny lines representing
writing have been scratched into the stone on the front of the obelisk,

ruined basalt blackened casket monstrance~
This basalt casket appears utterly ruined.  Cracks line the surface,
though the structure is still, overall, sound.  Ash and smoke leak from the
fissures, and whenever the piece is moved the disheartening clatter of
glass, metal, and other debris can be heard rattling around inside.

A Dark Channel~
Black water cuts a path through the floating vegetation of the fens. 
Flowing from west to east, the swift current remains relatively clear of
obstructions, sweeping debris downstream.  Beneath the channel, long dark
shapes glide about, their movements causing eddies on the surface.  Clumps
of rotting grass and other debris choke the surface of the fens on both
sides of the channel.

A Dark Channel North of an Island~
Dark water flows between clumps of floating vegetation.  The channel
flows from the south, held to its banks there by the solid ground of the
island.  To the north and east is the shifting quagmire of the fens.  The
swift channel bends sharply west, cutting a clear path toward the Dantaron. 
Dark shadows glide silently beneath the surface, their movements stirring
the water.

The Beginning of a Dark Channel~
A dark river channel begins here, its rank, fetid water flowing out of an
earthen embankment.  Reeking of death and decay, the water runs swiftly out
toward the fens to the north.  High walls of earth rear up on either side of
the channel, deeply eroded by the passage of the filthy water.  Huge trees
overhang the embankment to the east and west, the leaves a leprous yellow. 
Under the trees, the dense underbrush consists almost exclusively of
thistles, tightly packed, foot long thorns preventing passage.  A small
trail leads up over the embankment to the south.

On Murky Waters~
The dark, putrid water of the fens lies undisturbed by wind or current. 
The surface, covered by putrescent knots of grass and algae, spreads out in
all directions.  A thick mist rises up from the water, obscuring the horizon
and reeking of decay.  Drops of brownish dew form on the blades of grass
floating in the water, falling occasionally to the dark surface, the
dripping sound echoing across the fens.

decay.  The unfettered islands drift about, stirred by the motions of the

Small knots of grass float on top of the dark water of the fens.  Moved
about by gentle current, the anchorless islands bump against each other. 
Twisted saplings grow on some of the larger islands, their bark black as the
water from which they drink.  One larger sapling lies in the water, the knot
of debris holding it tipped sideways.  A thick mist rises form the surface,
obscuring the horizon.

A Narrow Path Through a Crevice~
The trail winds through a narrow crevice in the cliffs surrounding the

leaving the pitted rock of the cliffs open to view.  Patches of fungi grow
in the deeper shadows of the cliff, feeding on the rotting remains of the
trees that fall down from above.  Thick thorn bushes encroach upon the trail
inside the valley to the south.  The trail widens into a twisted forest to
the north.

Thick fog rises from the dark water of the fens.  The small floating

move silently beneath the surface, made indistinct by the hazy water.  A
small sapling has taken root on one of the larger islands, its limbs laden
with small yellow berries.  The leaves of the sapling are dappled with red
spots.  Similar spots of red decorate the island upon which the tree grows.

about by gentle current, the anchorless islands bump against each other. 
Twisted saplings grow on some of the larger islands, their bark black as the
water from which they drink.  One larger sapling lies in the water, the knot
of debris holding it tipped sideways.  A thick mist rises form the surface,
obscuring the horizon.

Tangled Underbrush Near the Edge of the Fens~
Huge bushes grow against a high cliff face.  Thorns, nearly a foot long,
sprout from the bushes, resisting movement in all directions.  A thin trail
follows the base of the cliff, choked by vines and briars.  Thick fog drifts
in from the fens east of the trail, covering everything with oily, brown
dew.  The yellow rock of the cliff, pocked and scarred by years of exposure
to the acidic moisture in the fens, rises high above the fog bank.

Tangled Underbrush Near the Edge of the Fens~
Thick bushes grow about the edge of the fens.  Thorns, nearly a foot
long, grow at odd angles into the narrow path leading through the brambles. 
Large tracks are visible on the damp, black soil beneath the thorn bushes. 
Still mist rises off the fens to the east, obscuring the cliff face above. 
The rank odor of rotting vegetation trails in from the fens.  There is a

The Ruins of an Ancient Tower~
Mighty slabs of basalt lay strewn about this clearing, a testament to the
glory this tower must once have commanded.  Now it lies largely in ruins,
with most of the foundation crumbled or missing.  The few remaining stone
buttresses barely serve to hold up the second story, which has long since
been opened to the sky.  Ropy vines snake their way up what is left of the
walls, encouraged by the humid atmosphere and unrepressed by any gardener\@s
hand.  Both a cracked doorway and half-vanished wall lead back north to what
may once have been an entryway to the tower, while a sloping pile of rubble
provides access to the upper floor.

Atop the Ruins of an Ancient Tower~
Though this level of the tower now lies exposed to the open sky, a
mostly-destroyed staircase and fragments of walls indicate that it may once
have merely been the second floor of a much taller structure.  This place
appears to have once been a library of sorts; ruined stone bookcases lie
cracked and pitted on their sides, and the remnants of several display cases
have been broken open and scattered about.  An intact reading bench carved
from granite sits against what is left of the north wall; the southern side
has no wall left at all.  To the south in the distance the jagged peaks of
the Mlejian Mountains can just barely be made out through the mists and fog
of the fens, while a sloping pile of rubble leads back down to the ground
floor of the tower.

On Murky Waters~
The dark water of the fens laps quietly against the shore to the south. 
Small islands, comprised of grass and other debris, float upon the surface. 
Thick mist rises above the fens, blurring the horizon and tinting it brown. 
Dark shapes move silently beneath the water, their movements stirring the
islands and forming small whirlpools, which suck down smaller bits of grass
and algae.

The dark, putrid water of the fens lies undisturbed by wind or current. 
The surface, covered by putrescent knots of grass and algae, spreads out in
all directions.  A thick mist rises up from the water, obscuring the horizon
and reeking of decay.  Drops of brownish dew form on the blades of grass
floating in the water, falling occasionally to the dark surface, the
dripping sound echoing across the fens.

leaving the rock stained and pitted.  Small eddies swirl dangerously in the
stream, sucking the carcasses of insects and the remains of tree limbs down
into the depths.  The river widens downstream, combining with the purer
waters of the Dantaron.  Upstream, the channel continues through the deeply

are visible on the side of the ridge, colored yellow in the ever-present
damp.  The trees are somewhat thinner overhead, the rock of the ridge
appearing more often than the fine black soil.  Above, the trees and
underbrush prevent motion on the steep incline.  The trail itself follows
the side of the ridge to the south, or down on a shallower grade.

Midway up a high cliff, the trail winds its way amongst the underbrush. 
Thorny bushes hold tenuously to the cracks in the pale yellow stone.  The
trees above, swaying in the breeze, lack the girth of the forest giants
below you, their fallen limbs decorating the stone face of the cliff.  One
of the trees from above, larger than the rest, lies just below the trail,
bits of earth still clinging to its exposed roots.  The path the limb took
down from the top is clearly marked by the swath of flattened brush leading
up to the top of the cliff.

shattered to the south, broken and cracked by the eons-old efforts of roots
and wind, leaving an impassable tumble of white and yellow boulders.  A
large tree limb, fallen from one of the larger trees, has cleared a path
toward the bottom of the ridge to the north.

have gained purchase here, keeping the dark waters to your south from
claiming more of the earth.  There are some twisted trees overhanging the
water, a few branches hanging lifeless and brittle as they brush the rank
and poisonous water.  Small insects litter the convergence of water and
land, some dead, others eagerly snacking on the corpses.  The beach
continues to the east and west, and a slope of tumbled boulders leads up the
cliff to the north.  The fens extend far to the south.

The river channel runs north and south, bordered on the east by a high
cliff face.  Bits of rotting grass and yellow foam float downstream toward
the Dantaron, carried by the swift current.  The water is sluggish where it
meets the western bank, allowing stacks of the yellow and brown foam to
accumulate.  Dangerous eddies near the eastern side of the channel suck
floating insects and foliage down beneath the surface.

There is a dark, swiftly moving channel to the west, disappearing into a
narrow canyon as it flows northwards.

A Ruin Atop a High Ridge~
A circle of mammoth stones rises from the ground, each one reaching
nearly twenty feet into the air.  The base of each stone is covered by light
gray green moss, blending smoothly with the dark gray stone above.  Large
tracks lead through a gap in the circle, where a nest of sorts is built of
twigs and moss.  A narrow trail continues along the top of the ridge to the
west.  Rubble is piled toward the edge of the ruined tower.

rubble~
Looking closer, a trapdoor is partially covered by rubble.  One could
attempt to clear the rubble.  
~
E
nest twig twigs moss~
This large nest appears to be less of a constructed resting-place and
more of an impact crater.  The depression in the ground is roughly nine feet
in diameter, and half again as deep.  Moss and twigs are humped around the
edges, and the inside surface is worn down by constant use.  
~
E
tracks~
Tracks with four toes, three in front and one in back, lead into the
circle of stones.  Deep gouges lie in the earth, fully a hand\@s span deep.

At the Edge of the Fens~
A wide shoreline lies between the fens to the south and a high cliff to
the north.  Pale yellow grasses grow in clumps on the ground, starved for
sunlight by both the high cliff and the mist over the fens.  A few rocks lie
scattered about, some having rolled as far as the edge of the water to the
south.  There is a dark channel to the east, the quickly moving current
keeping it clear of the floating vegetation of the fens to the south.  The
shoreline continues along the cliff face to the west.

the fens and cutting off travel.

A Dark Channel~
Black water cuts a path through the floating vegetation of the fens. 
Flowing from the south and bending sharply east, the swift current remains
relatively clear of obstructions.  Tough yellow grasses dot the solid ground
to the north.  A pocked and scarred cliff face rears up beyond the northern
shore, its stone surface colored a pale yellow.  Beneath the channel, long
dark shapes glide about, their movements causing eddies on the surface.

A Dark Channel~
Black water cuts a path through the floating vegetation of the fens. 
Flowing from south to north, the swift current remains relatively clear of
obstructions, sweeping debris downstream.  Beneath the channel, long dark
shapes glide about, their movements causing eddies on the surface.  Clumps
of rotting grass and other debris choke the surface of the fens on both
sides of the channel.
