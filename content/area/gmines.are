Lokand~
Lokand the nefortu is here.
~
A short being, Lokand the nefortean merchant has a distinctly shady
appearance.  His dark, leathery skin is stretched over a small frame, which
appears even smaller because of the merchant\@s slight hunch.  Two stubby
wings are folded at his back, a small claw tipping each.  His eyes are dark
and beady, their aspect doing nothing to mitigate his sinister appearance. 
A perpetual smirk seems to have taken over his countenance.

an undead miner~
An undead miner shuffles along here, its work long since abandoned.
~
Flesh decaying, this miner moves slowly about the mines.  Caught suddenly
by the curse that fell on all the lands, it long ago forgot its work.  It
looks to have once been human, though it is not easy to discern much else
through its rotting appearance.  Though its undead appetite can never be
appeased, it nonetheless endlessly seeks for life to feed upon.

The undead mining foreman stands here, reeking of decay.
~
In life, this foreman was probably a burly man.  However, undeath has
taken its toll on his muscles, and what little flesh remains to cover his
skeletal frame is constantly rotting.  The sockets that used to contain his
eyes are now empty holes, yet somehow he seems to see.  The foreman no
longer directs the other miners, choosing instead to join them in their
quest for life upon which to feed.

a yreg~
A humanoid yreg slouches here, parts of it rotting away.
~
Though it might be eight feet in height, the slouching position adopted
by the humanoid yreg precludes an accurate estimation.  Even when it moves
it fails to righten itself completely.  Despite its slack jaw and dull black
eyes, the creature appears to be tensed.  Devoid of apparent hair and
reeking with a most foul aroma, the yreg seems to be rotting slowly.  Long
claws adorn both of its hands, but on only one of them are they cracked and
yellow.  Faint burbling sounds emanate occasionally from the yreg\@s hideous
maw.

an oddly-formed yreg~
An oddly-formed yreg is here, eyes vacant.
~
Unlike most of the yregi -- who appear half-undead -- this particular
yreg has only tinges of undeath about him.  He is shorter than the rest,
standing only about six and a half feet tall, and bears much of the look of
a kankoran about him.  Like the rest of his kind, however, this yreg does
bear the characteristic slack jaw and vacant expression, as well as the
stench of decay.  He wears a tattered cloak that has almost completely
rotted away.

Each leg working in turn, a chateira scurries about.
~
A long, low beast with twenty legs, the chateira moves with a flowing
motion.  Its body is segmented, a pair of legs extended from each segment. 
At the front of the creature is a strange head with two sets of jaws, the
upper set being smaller and more pointed than the lower.  A faint sheen
glistens from the single, bulbous eye implanted in the middle of the
foremost segment.  Despite being almost seven feet long and two in height,
the creature moves easily through the mines.

Covered in a thick natural armor, the chateira warrior guards the chamber.
~
With an armored body composed of many segments, the chateira warrior
seems well-prepared for combat.  In addition to the double jaw
characteristic of its kind, the warrior also sports pointed forelegs.  These
appear to be formidable weapons.  Chittering sounds come occasionally from
the warrior\@s jaws as they snap together several times in rapid succession.

searching for any who would dare intrude on the nest.

A spindly-legged korakk moves silently through the mines.
~
Perched atop three thin legs, this odd creature of about human height
moves swiftly and quietly through the mines.  Its manner of locomotion can
be dizzying to observe, as it swivels about in a spinning motion.  Appearing
radially symmetric, the korakk has three small apertures at the top of its
form, bearing a striking resemblance to eyes.  Three thin tentacular
appendages protrude from its body just above the spindly legs, seemingly
used as manipulators of some kind.

a dark shadow~
A dark shadow looms here, difficult to see clearly.
~
Vaguely formed of void and dark matter, this black shape is difficult to
discern.  It moves in complete silence, gliding easily over its
surroundings.  Any light that happens to strike it is wholly consumed by its
being, rendering any internal features impossible to observe.  Visible only
by contrast, the thin outline is vaguely remniniscent of a lanky human, save
for the shadow of a large talon that springs from each hand.

a cyinyar ksash~
A dusky cyinyar ksash lurks about the shadows.
~
Formed of shadow and fear, this cyinyar ksash demon makes a formidable
opponent.  With long, curling fingers ending in claws and a large mouth
adorned by fierce, sharp fangs, the demon looks ready to feast upon whatever
life it can find.  Its face is set in a fierce glower, its red beady eyes
peering out at the world.

Naluzdandur~
Naluzdandur, Shadow of the Deep, looms above you.
~
Towering above you, this massive demon seems to make shadow and nightmare
manifest.  Dark and powerful arms sprout from his thick shoulders,
shimmering slightly.  Two ribbed wings formed of blackness arch out from his
back, stirring the air.  From his back protrudes a long tail adorned with a
sharp spike, whipping around as if in search of prey.  Both of his hands end
in dusky claws, seven per palm.  His fangs are quite long, jutting out over
his lower lip.

A bit short for the average human, this old man looks to be in poor

his withered appearance, his eyes are dark and steely, full of resolve. 
There is something faintly disconcerting about the way they shift about the

Eryiuk~
Eryiuk, leader of the Tarnan mercenaries is here.
~
Short cropped grey hair crowns the head of this grizzled middle aged
human male.  His face is scarred, testament to a life spent in less than
optimal situations.  Dark brown eyes radiate an instinctive wariness; their
gaze hints at frighteningly cold calculation.  He has a hooked nose that
appears to have been broken more than once.  The man carries the solid
muscular build of a warrior, one of both strength and casual grace.

This body has somehow escaped the ravages of time, remaining completely
undecayed.  In life, she looks to have been a rather beautiful woman by
ch\@taren standards, with shimmering golden skin and flowing silver hair. 
She is clad in scholarly robes, bearing the mark of the Order of the Silver
Light.  Her right hand is outstreched, palm facing the north.  Her left hand
rests on her breast, clutched tightly as if holding something.

orb swirled black glass~
an orb of swirled black glass~
An orb formed of swirled black glass sits here.~
The Archmage Leycera, in preparation for her sojourn to the cursed mines
of Gogoth, devised this orb.  The technicalities of its workings are
intricate and detailed, but the general concept is not difficult to
understand.  The orb, having been imbued with potent Spirit magic,
rigorously searches for souls that have been twisted in such a way as to be
denied Salvation or Damnation.  Upon discovering these souls adequately
detached from their hold on the Prime Materium, the power of the orb bends
the spirit in such a way as to permit it passage.  

The details of how the renowned Archmagus lost the orb are not widely-known,
but one immutable fact has been oft-discussed amongst the learned: after
entering the mines, she was ne\@er seen amongst the living again.

Four thousand spotted flamingos fly up, pulling $O\@s arial carriage behind them.
$O winks out of existence, vanishing into thin air.
$O grabs the ball, stiff-arms past you, and sprints for the endzone.
$O goes directly to jail, without passing GO or collecting $ 200.
The heavy chords of an organ signal $O\@s departure.
Suddenly, four burly men in white coats arrive and take $O away, kicking and screaming.
$O points at something behind you, then tiptoes out of the room.
$O looks up worriedly, gasps in panic, and runs in terror!
$O whistles and looks about. No mount answering the call, $O walks away dejectedly.
$O makes like a tree and leaves.

A dirk fashioned from ch\@lonin lies here, sparkling.~
One of the few remaining examples of the Art of Availlae which exists in
Avendar, this slender dirk is made of the living metal, ch\@lonin.  The
ch\@taren who arrived at the close of the War of Night faced possibly the
most immense demonic force in all of recorded history, and wielded many
powerful weapons from their home plane against them.  This dirk is almost
certainly among them.  

The exact role of the dirk during the fateful close of the War is not
entirely clear; some say that it helped to seal the demilord of nightmares,
Naluzdandur, deep within the earth beneath the mines of Gogoth, while others
suggest that it was stolen from a fallen ch\@taren zealot and treasured by
the thief\@s family.  Its presence within the kingdom, at least during the
final years before its spectacular collapse, was certainly a secret, and
likely hidden somewhere outside the view of the king.  

Because of its power, it was sealed by the Shadow of the Deep along with the
Dove of Arafia and other sought-after treasures of the light, to keep them
out of zealous hands.

nightmare longsword flickering shadows~
the flickering longsword, \#Nightmare\#~
A longsword forged of flickering shadows is here.~
This appears to be what remains of the mythic Blade of Iniun.  Reputed to
be forged by Ghertin of Avirle, it was broken during the Battle of Tisroc. 
According to legend, the sword possessed a number of valuable gems set into
its hilt, from which it gained additional power.  Once broken, treasure
hunters pried the jewels from the shattered blade and sold the broken pieces
for profit.  The ancient caladaran sage, Jacharan, gathered the fragments of
the sword and presented them to the Earendam Gallery, where they remained on
display for many years.  

After the murder of the Patrician, Danrasad Elinstad, many of the city\@s
more famous artifacts were hidden to prevent their capture by the Scourge. 
This included the pieces of the Blade of Iniun, which were scattered
throughout Avendar in an attempt to guard them from theft.  Despite this,
the shards were tracked and stolen by a traveler named Lazular Apheru, who
sought their power for himself.  It is said that the Kor Thrandian Spirit
master, Valaiar Nora, fought Lazular\@s efforts, but was defeated.  With
Nora\@s death, records of the Blade, and Lazular, end.  

With its holy powers drained and its subjection to the constant, seething
corruption of Naluzdandur, the weapon has become known as Nightmare.  It is
said to play upon the fears of those who face it, its shadowy blade sapping
the life of its victims.

several enchanted compasses.  Though many have been lost to the feckless
winds of time, a few are still used today.  It is believed that Baron Krilin
and the Patrician each have one.  

To form this particular model, Ghertin had to fight and slay the Wyrm of
Orlot, a foul beast which plagued the Uthlin in his time.  From its scales
he made this device, and imbued in it the power to locate precious gems. 
How the compass came into the hands of King Gogoth is not precisely known,
but ere the curse upon the realm of Gogoth the king\@s miners used it in
their efforts.

orb swirled black glass~
an orb of swirled black glass~
An orb formed of swirled black glass sits here.~
The Archmage Leycera, in preparation for her sojourn to the cursed mines
of Gogoth, devised this orb.  The technicalities of its workings are
intricate and detailed, but the general concept is not difficult to
understand.  The orb, having been imbued with potent Spirit magic,
rigorously searches for souls that have been twisted in such a way as to be
denied Salvation or Damnation.  Upon discovering these souls adequately
detached from their hold on the Prime Materium, the power of the orb bends
the spirit in such a way as to permit it passage.  

The details of how the renowned Archmagus lost the orb are not widely-known,
but one immutable fact has been oft-discussed amongst the learned: after
entering the mines, she was ne\@er seen amongst the living again.

the Shaft of Adumbration~
A dusky shaft lies here, nearly obscured in shadow.~
Forged in the dark and obscure pits of the Nether regions, the Shaft of
Adumbration was created for the purpose of arming Naluzdandur, Shadow of the
Deeps.  This demon demilord sought to enter the Prime Material by
capitalizing on the negative energy brought forth by the lich King Gogoth. 
Before he could gather his full strength in this plane, however, a small and
courageous band led by the Archmage Leycera succeeded in trapping him within
Gogoth\@s mines.  The effort cost them their lives, but kept the unsuspecting
world safe.  

The Shaft itself is fashioned of shadow and nightmare, and can only be
wielded by one whose heart matches in kind.

work -- after mastering the craft -- to make a Diamond of Focusing.  This
particular specimen was created not too long after the War of the Night, and
kept amongst the few artifacts of Earendam\@s Order of the Silver Light.  The
Archmage Leycera took the stone for the purpose of containing Naluzdandur, a
demilord of shadow demons.  There is no official record of her fate.

platinum dove amulet~
a platinum amulet shaped as a dove~
A dove-shaped amulet formed from platinum is here, its wings glittering.~
This platinum pendant belonged to the renowned mage, Arafia, remembered
for all time for his heroism in the rescue of his lover, Istera the Green. 
According to legend, he delved into the nether to pursue her, and escaped
with both her, and his life.  It was he who first challenged the dread power
of Naluzdandur, demilord of nightmares, and his victory elevated him to
stand with the greatest of heroes.  Some say that the dove-pendant he wore
granted him great power; others say that it resonated with the purity of his
soul, and contains a fragment of his might.  

The Dove itself eluded scholars and historians for countless generations. 
While its story was well-known, no one knew precisely what it looked like,
and those who came to possess it did not realize the magnitude of its fame. 
It passed from hand to hand, family to family, eventually finding its way to
a clan of laborers in the ancient kingdom of Gogoth.  As they drove deeper
into the earth in search of riches, the dormant demilord sensed its presence
and stirred.  Still weak, it plagued the miners with persistent nightmares. 

The curse of Gamaloth, invoked by the Lich King, sapped the lives of all
within Gogoth\@s domain.  As darkness settled upon the dying plain of
Shargob, Naluzdandur fully awoke.  Perrun, who possessed the Dove, was one
of the only survivors of the kingdom\@s transformation.  However, he was no
warrior, and fell swiftly to the terrible fury of the demilord.  Recalling
his ancient defeat, Naluzdandur sealed the Dove within a pocket of void,
along with other artifacts of the light.  

The sojourn of the Archmage Leycera was ostensibly undertaken in search of
the Dove, but she and her party never returned.

Legends tell of the powerful bond between the Archmage Leycera and her

day, the couple exchanged a pair of rings formed of Spirit magics through
the efforts of the archmage.  These rings, it was said, helped to keep them
ever close.  

These bands comprise Prentirn\@s ring.  Though neither of the two were ever
seen alive again after they entered Gogoth\@s mines, their rings still exist.
However, their full power can never be experienced when separated, for they
were forged in the bonds of unity.

a ring formed from thin bands of energy~
A brightly-glowing ring has been left here.~
Legends tell of the powerful bond between the Archmage Leycera and her
famous swordmaster husband, Prentirn.  It is believed that on their wedding
day, the couple exchanged a pair of rings formed of Spirit magics through
the efforts of the archmage.  These rings, it was said, helped to keep them
ever close.  

These thin bands comprise Leycera\@s ring.  Though neither of the two were
ever seen alive again after they entered Gogoth\@s mines, their rings still
exist.  However, their full power can never be experienced when separated,
for they were forged in the bonds of unity.

If there is one thing to be said of Leycera, it is that she always
managed to get her way.  We set out within the week.  The plan was to make
the trip to Var Bandor first, to prepare our supplies and rendevous with the
rest of our party.  Apparently, this meant a small band of mercenaries from
Ashta Harrud that Leycera had secured some time before in anticipation of
the journey.  From Bandor we would press on to the Undead City itself.

The trip along the Arien Road was largely uneventful, the way I liked it. 
Besides Leycera, Prentirn, and myself, there was only one attendant with us,
a hulking kankoran with a gruff appearance and surprisingly pleasant
demeanor.  We made quite a spectacle.  Two humans, a ch\@taren, and a
kankoran moving purposefully west together cannot fail to raise eyebrows,
especially when one is a famous warrior and the other an almost
equally-renowned archmage.

Leycera and Prentirn spent much time together, and I could not help but feel
a twinge of jealousy for her.  Men of his kind did not come by often.  I
thought then -- and know now -- that I spent too much time on my studies. 
But alas, naught can be done at this point.
~
E
3~
Three months later Prentirn\@s presence was suddenly explained.  The news
of the wedding of the famed swordmaster to the archmage spread quickly, and
much talk of it abounded in the Tower, as well.  Much to my surprise, I was
invited.  The ceremony itself was a formal occasion, but has little bearing
on this recanting.  I must move on, as the protective glow continues to
fade.

It was a full two years before I saw Leycera again.  I was in my study,
pouring over a text by Tresacran on the theory of elementals when she
appeared suddenly in my doorway.  She cut her usual graceful figure, clad in
shimmering silver robes and radiating excitement.  \#I think I\@ve found it!\# 
She said.  The uncustomary entrance and greeting caught me off-guard, but I
quickly regained my composure and offered her a seat.  Declining, she paced
about the room, speaking rapidly.

\#I have for some years now been studying ancient artifacts, attempting to
discern their powers, purposes, and whereabouts.  The past year I have
dedicated to finding the Dove of Arafia, an amulet of considerable power. 
And I think I have it!\#

Leycera continued her rant for some time, and slowly her enthusiam spread to
me.  Apparently, her research had uncovered that the Dove had passed down
the line of Arafia, a line that dwindled in renown as the ages passed. 
Though the story of Arafia\@s descent into the Nether Pits for his lover is
well-known, there are few tales indeed of any heroic deeds performed by his
descendants.  At length the Dove came into the possession of the last of his
line, a simple mine worker living in the realm of Gogoth.  When the foul
King\@s curse fell upon the kingdom, all knowledge of the Dove passed from
mortal memory.  But not if Leycera was to have her way.  She was proposing a
journey to the undead city itself, in search of the Dove.  And she wanted me
along.
~
E
10~
We took shifts lowering people.  It was possible to lower oneself, but
required more muscular effort.  Hence, the kankoran -- whose name I could
never pronounce, much less scribe -- was the last to go.  He was lowering
the last of the mercenaries down to the rest of us standing below when we
heard a terrific bellowing sound from above.

The horror of what was happening struck us at about the same time as the
cage struck the ground.  Hard.  The Tarnan warrior didn\@t stand a chance. 
Apparently, the mine shaft didn\@t either.  The impact of the device was
enough to shake the shaft, and bits of rock began falling from above.  It
soon turned into a shower of stone, accompanied by the roars of our kankoran
compatriot, who was fighting for his life at the top of the steep shaft.

Then the ceiling collapsed.  We fled into the mining tunnel to escape being
crushed.  It suddenly occurred to me that despite the distate I had borne
for Var Bandor, I would have given anything to have been back there.  I do
not know what happened to the trusty kankoran, nor the orb he carried.  Both
were missed sorely over the next two days, measuring by the sleeping periods
we attempted to observe.

We made camp in a dark bend in the tunnel, leaving fully half of our
remaining complement to stand guard.  It was the first I had seen Leycera
actually look worried.
~
E
1~
I don\@t know how much longer I have, doubtless only a few hours, so I am
scribbling these pages in the hopes that one day my account might be found. 
Already the shadows draw close about me, and darkness seeks to overwhelm my
fading spirit...

It all started with Leycera, as most things did.  I first met her when I was
a mere pupil in the Tower of Salyra, when we received among our patients one
afflicted by a blight of the mind that mystified even the more advanced
journeymagi of the guild.  One of the masters recognized it as Void work,
and sent for a magus from the Order of the Silver Light.

I was tending a nearby patient when Leycera arrived.  Though she was less
than half of my eighteen years, already she was a respected journeywoman of
Spirit magics.  I had heard of her briefly as a rising genius of the Order,
but this was the first I had ever seen her.  Like most of her peculiar race,
her skin was a warm golden color, faintly translucent.  Her hair was long
and silvered, but not the silver of old age that I will not live to see. 
She entered with a grace and power that was evident even to one of my lowly
station, but no trace of haughtiness clouded her presence.  The power she
bore simply was, and she took it for granted as one of the rest of us might
regard an arm or leg.

It did not take her long to finish with the afflicted man, but ere she
departed I noticed that she cast a meaningful glance at me, as if somehow
knowing even then that our fates were to be so greatly intertwined.
~
E
2~
When next I saw Leycera, I had grown myself into a respected journeywoman
in the Tower.  She had not in the meantime left the promise of her rapid
ascent unfulfilled, and there was much rumor that she would soon be named an
Archmage.  At the time, I had just finished delivering my thesis on the
Cousten meditation techniques, and was surprised to find her waiting for me
afterwards.  Surprised by her, yes, but even more so by the startling green
eyes of the human behind her.  His face was kindly and bestubbled with a
faint beard.  He comported himself with an unusual grace, and he seemed to
radiate charm.  Prentirn, I recalled, the famed swordmaster.  A quick glance
to the two elegant blades at his sides confirmed the recollection.  But why
was he here?

Leycera was complimenting me on the thesis.  Bringing my thoughts back to
the present, I flushed slightly in embarrassment.  We conversed for a brief
period, but she never introduced Prentirn or explained her visit.  When I
retired to my chambers that evening, however, it was not her face that
stayed in my mind as I drifted off, but his.
~
E
5~
We reached the port town of Var Bandor the evening of the 13th day of The
Reaping.  After being ferried across the Dantaron, we secured lodging at The
Journey\@s End, not too far from Bandor\@s main square.  Every time I came
here I liked it less and less, and this instance was no exception. 
Earendam, the city of my birth and youth, is far grander.

The next day we went to the Nymph\@s Tears to meet with the captain of the
mercenaries.  A tall human clad in the armor of the Tarnan mercenary house
and bearing a prepossessing grin, I liked him at once.  Later I learned he
had been a friend of Leycera\@s father, and was not unknown to Prentirn,
either.  The man\@s name was Damasd, and he was accompanied by a lieutenant
of sorts by the name of Fersn.  This latter I did not like from the moment I
laid eyes on him, and later events bore this intuition out.  His skin was a
noticeable shade lighter than the copper color of the captain, bordering on
sallow.  Several scars (from knife-fighting, I later learned) were evident
on his knuckles, and his smile seemed forced.  The rest of the men were of a
mixed sort and numbered six, not including Damasd or Fersn.

Leycera provided funds (where did she get all the money?)  for canoes, and
ere long our reinforced party was on its way down the Dantaron towards the
cursed plains of Shargob.  What fools we mortals be.
~
E
6~
We traveled the Dantaron, arriving at a possible mooring point sometime
in the late afternoon.  The place looked to have been a dock at one point,
but was quite overrun now.  A sign was posted -- \#Warning!  To the west are
the cursed Plains of Shargob!  To enter is death!\#.  We tied up our boats
and proceeded to enter into our first squabble.  The Tarnan mercenaries
wanted to spend the night at the makeshift dock rather than risk the plains
by the night that was fast approaching.  Looking out over what I could see
of the barren lands to the west, I could see their point.  Leycera, however,
had different ideas.  And Leycera always got her way.  After a small
argument, we began trudging west, the mercenaries muttering amongst
themselves.  Soon we had left the boats behind, along with the unheeded
warning sign, which kept its grim watch over the docks.

After we had proceeded some leagues along an ancient road, the sun fell
behind the tall westerly mountains called the Yagash.  I could feel my heart
rate increase almost involuntarily.  It was almost an hour before I realized
my knuckles had grown white from gripping my staff.  Leycera, apparently
unfazed by the evil of the place, led the way.  She was infused with a soft
white light, and I could once again appreciate the extraordinary charisma
she possessed.  Somehow, I was comforted.

We arrived at a bend in the road without incident, despite the decidedly
unwholesome skitterings we heard from all around us.  There we made camp,
appointing several of the men to keep watch.  I think Leycera may have, as
well, but I was too exhausted to do much but sleep, and they didn\@t disturb
me until we were preparing to move on.  As I roused my sore muscles the
thought of soft couches and comfortable beds flashed across my mind, but I
quickly suppressed it.  Too much to do.

Sometime after noon, we reached the ruins of Gogoth city.
~
E
7~
How can I describe what we found in that horrible city?  And yet, our
experiences paled in comparison to what happened later.  Undead zombies
stalked through the place, ever a threat even though our trained mercenaries
made short work of each that wandered too close.  The stench was
overbearing, and it required a stiff force of will on at least my part to
continue.  I think it helped to reflect on what it would mean to turn back
alone now.

At one point we came across the form of a child, shuffling along in its
undeath.  What foulness possessed the king to so doom his kingdom? 
Fortunately, we didn\@t have to slay it, as the creature moved along away
from us.  We searched a great portion of the city, relying on Leycera\@s
sense of spirit to guide us to repositories of power.  In this manner we
found a run-down temple and several items of minor (and typically unholy)
strength.  The Dove, however, was not to be found.  As the day wore on, I
looked with increasing apprehension at the palace that loomed to the north. 
Surely, I felt, that was our next destination.  The mere rumor of what lay
within was enough to chill me to the bone, and I entertained little desire
to verify those tales.

As the day wore to a close, Leycera made the announcement.  Much to my
surprise, we were not to enter the palace, but rather seek out the mines.  I
supposed that it made sense, as the descendant of Arafia was one of the
miners in this place.  It would be several more days ere I realized that she
had to have known that would be our destination from the start.  Nothing
else makes sense - why else the excess of hired force?  Why else choose to
not search the palace, and why else give up so easily on the city?  Why else
prepare the orb?...  But I am getting ahead of myself.  At the time, I was
simply flooded with relief at not having to enter the palace.  Now, I wish
we had chosen the palace.  No.  I wish we had never come.
~
E
8~
The mercenaries grumbled again when we stepped off the road onto the
cursed plains, but didn\@t put up much of a verbal fight.  Perhaps they were
inspired by the ease of passage thus far, or perhaps they were just glad to
be putting the awful reek of the city behind them.  We had camped on the
road for the night, again without incident, and so were opposed only by a
few large crabs as we traversed the plains to the mines.  Leycera led us
swiftly and surely, and we never had to face that rumored horror, the
maglat.  Perhaps it doesn\@t exist, I know not.

It was late morning when we reached the mines.  The entrance loomed in front
of us, dark and forbidding, and for moment I wondered about the wisdom of
this move.  But Prentirn entered without hesitation, a fine display of
courage.  And so, trusting to Leycera\@s judgment, I pushed the doubts aside
and followed.  If you have found this manuscript, you already know of what
these mines contain, so I will not provide excessive detail.  Time is
becoming more important now, and I fear I must hasten my narrative.
~
E
9~
We soon came across these strange beasts, \#yregi\#, as Leycera named them.
Denizens of the mines, partially turned undead by the curse of Gogoth.  With
twisted souls, they could not perish.  Somehow, Leycera had foreseen this
difficulty.  She produced an orb fashioned of glass from her robes,
apparently imbued with some sort of spirit magic that allowed yreg souls to
pass on.  I do not understand it, and it no longer matters to me.  My gruff
kankoran friend bore its weight as we traveled.

It was here that we suffered our first casualty.  The yregi came in a swarm,
and though we drove them back, one of the mercenaries was slain.  This,
naturally, caused further unrest amongst those who remained.  Fortunately,
Damasd stepped in with a firm hand and got them back in order.  We pressed
forward swiftly.

Ere long we came to a strange device.  It looked like a cage of sorts, and
was attached to the ceiling by a system of pulleys.  It did not take long to
determine that the device could be lowered slowly down a large hole in the
ground, presumably a former vertical shaft.  Though the tunnel we were in
continued off to the north, Leycera seemed unhesitating in her desire to go
deeper into the mines.  Even Damasd looked at her with momentary disbelief,
but we all dutifully followed.
~
E
11~
Somehow, we all survived the night.  One of the mercenaries complained of
horrific nightmares, but none of us found that particularly surprising. 
Remarkably, there were few jibes made in regards to this from amongst the
hired warriors.  We had nothing to do but press on, so we did, wearing our
hearts in our throats.

How can I describe the events of that day, to do justice to what we all
felt?  The terror I experienced was surpassed only by that which I felt the
next day, and now.  I have not the time to detail this more dramatically, so
I will be blunt.  We were assailed by massive beasts with horrific, bulbous
eyes and deadly jaws.  They slew two more of the mercenaries, but this was
not foremost in my mind.  One of the many-legged creatures struck towards
Leycera, but Prentirn intervened.  Even with his remarkable speed and
agility, he had only the time to place his own body in front of hers, not to
turn the blow itself.  And so, deep within the cursed earth, Prentirn of the
Blazing Swords met his end in the jaws of an overgrown insect.

I cannot imagine what Leycera must have felt.  The look that transfixed her
face defies recounting.  However, I know myself the loss I felt.  I think in
that moment I realized what it truly means to be mortal, and to know that
death will come soon.  It would likely have come then, were it not for
Damasd.  Somehow, he managed to organize a retreat deeper into the mines,
down a sloping shaft.  The creatures did not follow, and we had a chance to
take stock of our situation.

Needless to say, it was bleak.
~
E
12~
Of the twelve who originally set out, only half now remained: Leycera,
myself, Damasd, Fersn, and two of the hired warriors.  There was no
grumbling anymore.  One of the mercenaries -- the same who had complained of
nightmares -- was particularly jittering, constantly looking over his
shoulder and peering into the shadows.  Maybe he had cause to.  He was next
to go.

It happened suddenly.  A dark mist roiled up from out of time and space,
covering the mercenary completely.  Just as swiftly as it came, it departed
again...  And the man of Tarnan was no longer there.  There were no cries or
shouts.  He simply wasn\@t there anymore.  We continued on in stony silence,
our spirits gripped by a firm resolve to see this through.  After all, we
could no longer turn back.

As the five of us passed through the depths of the mines, we glimpsed some
strange creatures that looked almost like fearsome walking tripods. 
Fortunately, they passed swiftly by.  We continued our descent into further
darkness.

We had travelled for some time when Leycera stopped suddenly and ordered
us to make camp.  Relieved to have the rest, we gladly obliged.  The shining
light around the archmage had faded to a muted glow by this time.  I
marvelled at her ability to remain composed after all that had happened. 
But even as I admired her, half-formulated suspicions grew in my mind.  Why
were we going so deeply into the mines?  Why had she hired a much bigger
force than was necessary to enter the city?  She must have known we would be
coming here...  And I was less than certain we were actually here for the
Dove.  But what she had in mind, I knew not.

We had not yet finished our meager meal when It came.  A Shadow, the like of
which I had never before seen, swept about us, and for a moment all was
dark.  I cried out in terror as it passed, and my heart felt ready to
explode from overwork.  Fersn and the mercenary froze in place, tied down by
their fear.  Damasd, like the true soldier he was, had somehow already
grabbed his spear and stood at the ready by the time I noticed him.  Leycera
snapped to attention, but did not seem surprised.  She must have been
expecting this.

We had arrived.  The end was nigh.
~

The ensuing struggle cannot be adequately described in the common tongue,
or any that I know.  What the Shadow was I still know not, but it fought
with an unnatural strength.  The hired Tarnan fell to it swiftly, his body
vanishing beyond sight and mind.  Fersn cowered behind Damasd, who took the
brunt of the onslaught.  All around us the darkness grew, and demons of
night and dusk seemed to spring from the walls themselves.  I was far too
focused on keeping Damasd alive to notice precisely what Leycera was doing,
so it came as a surprise when the bright light sprang out from her to fill
the cavern.  The demons snarled, drawing back from the intensity of the
illumination.  In front of me, Damasd slumped to the ground.  He was dead.

As quickly as they had come, the denizens of the deep vanished.  There was a
moment of stillness.  Then a mocking laugh echoed down the passage towards
us, and a dark form began to materialize before us.

Leycera wasted no time.  She shoved a strangely-humming ruby into my hands,
then hauled Fersn up from his cowering position and placed an equally
singular sapphire in his shaking palms.  I could feel the power of the stone
throbbing in my grasp, and suddenly a calm swept over me.  What would be,
would be.
~
E

As the dark form started to take definite shape, Leycera raised her hands
high.  One of them clutched a diamond of unusual clarity, and the other was
faced palm outwards towards the black outline.  Though I am fairly adept at
the ch\@taren language, the words she spoke were uttered too quickly for me
to understand.  I could feel the power focused from my ruby as she spoke
them, spreading out towards the darkness...

And nothing happened.  The incantation failed.  For the first time, I had
seen the power of Leycera fail entirely.  The calm resolve that had washed
over me quickly faded into anxiety and fear, and I glanced around in
panicked confusion.  It was that glance that explained the matter to me. 
Leycera was there, still shining brightly as the darkness formed.  But
across from me, the only trace I could make of Fersn was his legs, moving
swiftly away from us.

It is said that the courage of one can raise a nation, and the cowardice of
one can break it.  Never before had I realized the truth of that adage.  The
fool.  He had nowhere to run but to death.  But such is the nature of times
like these -- they reach through the facade that all mortals invent, and
pull out the true character that lies underneath.

Leycera understood the problem as quickly as I did.  Her chant did not
stop, but instead subtly altered.  Suddenly, the beam of light streaming
into the dark shape grew in intensity.  I did not at first realize where the
power was being drawn from, I was just grateful to see it appear.  Slowly, a
wall of pure light formed between us and the shape, which hollered and
bellowed in frustration.  Soon, it was completely sealed off.  Then Leycera
fell to the ground.

She had spent her own life to build the wall.  Even my magics could not
restore her.

The light that had filled this place has been slow to die, but fade it

I have taken Leycera\@s wedding ring, and wear it now.  I do not do this from
pretention or jealousy, but because the connection it makes me feel with
Prentirn is helping keep my spirits alive.  I have no recourse now.

Of the twelve who originally set out, only half now remained: Leycera,
myself, Damasd, Fersn, and two of the hired warriors.  There was no
grumbling anymore.  One of the mercenaries -- the same who had complained of
nightmares -- was particularly jittering, constantly looking over his
shoulder and peering into the shadows.  Maybe he had cause to.  He was next
to go.  

It happened suddenly.  A dark mist roiled up from out of time and space,
covering the mercenary completely.  Just as swiftly as it came, it departed
again...  And the man of Tarnan was no longer there.  There were no cries or
shouts.  He simply wasn\@t there anymore.  We continued on in stony silence,
our spirits gripped by a firm resolve to see this through.  After all, we
could no longer turn back.  

As the five of us passed through the depths of the mines, we glimpsed some
strange creatures that looked almost like fearsome walking tripods. 
Fortunately, they passed swiftly by.  We continued our descent into further
darkness.  
~
E
eleven pageeleven~
Somehow, we all survived the night.  One of the mercenaries complained of
horrific nightmares, but none of us found that particularly surprising. 
Remarkably, there were few jibes made in regards to this from amongst the
hired warriors.  We had nothing to do but press on, so we did, wearing our
hearts in our throats.  

How can I describe the events of that day, to do justice to what we all
felt?  The terror I experienced was surpassed only by that which I felt the
next day, and now.  I have not the time to detail this more dramatically, so
I will be blunt.  We were assailed by massive beasts with horrific, bulbous
eyes and deadly jaws.  They slew two more of the mercenaries, but this was
not foremost in my mind.  One of the many-legged creatures struck towards
Leycera, but Prentirn intervened.  Even with his remarkable speed and
agility, he had only the time to place his own body in front of hers, not to
turn the blow itself.  And so, deep within the cursed earth, Prentirn of the
Blazing Swords met his end in the jaws of an overgrown insect.  

I cannot imagine what Leycera must have felt.  The look that transfixed her
face defies recounting.  However, I know myself the loss I felt.  I think in
that moment I realized what it truly means to be mortal, and to know that
death will come soon.  It would likely have come then, were it not for
Damasd.  Somehow, he managed to organize a retreat deeper into the mines,
down a sloping shaft.  The creatures did not follow, and we had a chance to
take stock of our situation.  

Needless to say, it was bleak.  
~
E
ten pageten~
We took shifts lowering people.  It was possible to lower oneself, but
required more muscular effort.  Hence, the kankoran -- whose name I could
never pronounce, much less scribe -- was the last to go.  He was lowering
the last of the mercenaries down to the rest of us standing below when we
heard a terrific bellowing sound from above.  

The horror of what was happening struck us at about the same time as the
cage struck the ground.  Hard.  The Tarnan warrior didn\@t stand a chance. 
Apparently, the mine shaft didn\@t either.  The impact of the device was
enough to shake the shaft, and bits of rock began falling from above.  It
soon turned into a shower of stone, accompanied by the roars of our kankoran
compatriot, who was fighting for his life at the top of the steep shaft.  

Then the ceiling collapsed.  We fled into the mining tunnel to escape being
crushed.  It suddenly occurred to me that despite the distate I had borne
for Var Bandor, I would have given anything to have been back there.  I do
not know what happened to the trusty kankoran, nor the orb he carried.  Both
were missed sorely over the next two days, measuring by the sleeping periods
we attempted to observe.  

We made camp in a dark bend in the tunnel, leaving fully half of our
remaining complement to stand guard.  It was the first I had seen Leycera
actually look worried.  
~
E
nine pagenine~
We soon came across these strange beasts, \#yregi\#, as Leycera named them.
Denizens of the mines, partially turned undead by the curse of Gogoth.  With
twisted souls, they could not perish.  Somehow, Leycera had foreseen this
difficulty.  She produced an orb fashioned of glass from her robes,
apparently imbued with some sort of spirit magic that allowed yreg souls to
pass on.  I do not understand it, and it no longer matters to me.  My gruff
kankoran friend bore its weight as we traveled.  

It was here that we suffered our first casualty.  The yregi came in a swarm,
and though we drove them back, one of the mercenaries was slain.  This,
naturally, caused further unrest amongst those who remained.  Fortunately,
Damasd stepped in with a firm hand and got them back in order.  We pressed
forward swiftly.  

Ere long we came to a strange device.  It looked like a cage of sorts, and
was attached to the ceiling by a system of pulleys.  It did not take long to
determine that the device could be lowered slowly down a large hole in the
ground, presumably a former vertical shaft.  Though the tunnel we were in
continued off to the north, Leycera seemed unhesitating in her desire to go
deeper into the mines.  Even Damasd looked at her with momentary disbelief,
but we all dutifully followed.  
~

The mercenaries grumbled again when we stepped off the road onto the
cursed plains, but didn\@t put up much of a verbal fight.  Perhaps they were
inspired by the ease of passage thus far, or perhaps they were just glad to
be putting the awful reek of the city behind them.  We had camped on the
road for the night, again without incident, and so were opposed only by a
few large crabs as we traversed the plains to the mines.  Leycera led us
swiftly and surely, and we never had to face that rumored horror, the
maglat.  Perhaps it doesn\@t exist, I know not.  

It was late morning when we reached the mines.  The entrance loomed in front
of us, dark and forbidding, and for a moment I wondered about the wisdom of
this move.  But Prentirn entered without hesitation, a fine display of
courage.  And so, trusting to Leycera\@s judgment, I pushed the doubts aside
and followed.  If you have found this manuscript, you already know of what
these mines contain, so I will not provide excessive detail.  Time is
becoming more important now, and I fear I must hasten my narrative.  
~

How can I describe what we found in that horrible city?  And yet, our
experiences paled in comparison to what happened later.  Undead zombies
stalked through the place, ever a threat even though our trained mercenaries
made short work of each that wandered too close.  The stench was
overbearing, and it required a stiff force of will on at least my part to
continue.  I think it helped to reflect on what it would mean to turn back
alone now.  

At one point we came across the form of a child, shuffling along in its
undeath.  What foulness possessed the king to so doom his kingdom? 
Fortunately, we didn\@t have to slay it, as the creature moved along away
from us.  We searched a great portion of the city, relying on Leycera\@s
sense of spirit to guide us to repositories of power.  In this manner we
found a run-down temple and several items of minor (and typically unholy)
strength.  The Dove, however, was not to be found.  As the day wore on, I
looked with increasing apprehension at the palace that loomed to the north. 
Surely, I felt, that was our next destination.  The mere rumor of what lay
within was enough to chill me to the bone, and I entertained little desire
to verify those tales.  

As the day wore to a close, Leycera made the announcement.  Much to my
surprise, we were not to enter the palace, but rather seek out the mines.  I
supposed that it made sense, as the descendant of Arafia was one of the
miners in this place.  It would be several more days ere I realized that she
had to have known that would be our destination from the start.  Nothing
else makes sense - why else the excess of hired force?  Why else choose to
not search the palace, and why else give up so easily on the city?  Why else
prepare the orb?...  But I am getting ahead of myself.  At the time, I was
simply flooded with relief at not having to enter the palace.  Now, I wish
we had chosen the palace.  No.  I wish we had never come.  
~

We traveled the Dantaron, arriving at a possible mooring point sometime
in the late afternoon.  The place looked to have been a dock at one point,
but was quite overrun now.  A sign was posted -- \#Warning!  To the west are
the cursed Plains of Shargob!  To enter is death!\#.  We tied up our boats
and proceeded to enter into our first squabble.  The Tarnan mercenaries
wanted to spend the night at the makeshift dock rather than risk the plains
by the night that was fast approaching.  Looking out over what I could see
of the barren lands to the west, I could see their point.  Leycera, however,
had different ideas.  And Leycera always got her way.  After a small
argument, we began trudging west, the mercenaries muttering amongst
themselves.  Soon we had left the boats behind, along with the unheeded
warning sign, which kept its grim watch over the docks.  

After we had proceeded some leagues along an ancient road, the sun fell
behind the tall westerly mountains called the Yagash.  I could feel my heart
rate increase almost involuntarily.  It was almost an hour before I realized
my knuckles had grown white from gripping my staff.  Leycera, apparently
unfazed by the evil of the place, led the way.  She was infused with a soft
white light, and I could once again appreciate the extraordinary charisma
she possessed.  Somehow, I was comforted.  

We arrived at a bend in the road without incident, despite the decidedly
unwholesome skitterings we heard from all around us.  There we made camp,
appointing several of the men to keep watch.  I think Leycera may have, as
well, but I was too exhausted to do much but sleep, and they didn\@t disturb
me until we were preparing to move on.  As I roused my sore muscles the
thought of soft couches and comfortable beds flashed across my mind, but I
quickly suppressed it.  Too much to do.  

Sometime after noon, we reached the ruins of Gogoth city.  
~
E
five pagefive~
We reached the port town of Var Bandor the evening of the 13th day of The
Reaping.  After being ferried across the Dantaron, we secured lodging at The
Journey\@s End, not too far from Bandor\@s main square.  Every time I came
here I liked it less and less, and this instance was no exception. 
Earendam, the city of my birth and youth, is far grander.  

The next day we went to the Nymph\@s Tears to meet with the captain of the
mercenaries.  A tall human clad in the armor of the Tarnan mercenary house
and bearing a prepossessing grin, I liked him at once.  Later I learned he
had been a friend of Leycera\@s father, and was not unknown to Prentirn,
either.  The man\@s name was Damasd, and he was accompanied by a lieutenant
of sorts by the name of Fersn.  This latter I did not like from the moment I
laid eyes on him, and later events bore this intuition out.  His skin was a
noticeable shade lighter than the copper color of the captain, bordering on
sallow.  Several scars (from knife-fighting, I later learned) were evident
on his knuckles, and his smile seemed forced.  The rest of the men were of a
mixed sort and numbered six, not including Damasd or Fersn.  

Leycera provided funds (where did she get all the money?)  for canoes, and
ere long our reinforced party was on its way down the Dantaron towards the
cursed plains of Shargob.  What fools we mortals be.  
~
E
four pagefour~
If there is one thing to be said of Leycera, it is that she always
managed to get her way.  We set out within the week.  The plan was to make
the trip to Var Bandor first, to prepare our supplies and rendevous with the
rest of our party.  Apparently, this meant a small band of mercenaries from
Ashta Harrud that Leycera had secured some time before in anticipation of
the journey.  From Bandor we would press on to the Undead City itself.  

The trip along the Arien Road was largely uneventful, the way I liked it. 
Besides Leycera, Prentirn, and myself, there was only one attendant with us,
a hulking kankoran with a gruff appearance and surprisingly pleasant
demeanor.  We made quite a spectacle.  Two humans, a ch\@taren, and a
kankoran moving purposefully west together cannot fail to raise eyebrows,
especially when one is a famous warrior and the other an almost
equally-renowned archmage.  

Leycera and Prentirn spent much time together, and I could not help but feel
a twinge of jealousy for her.  Men of his kind did not come by often.  I
thought then -- and know now -- that I spent too much time on my studies. 
But alas, naught can be done at this point.  
~
E
three pagethree~
Three months later Prentirn\@s presence was suddenly explained.  The news
of the wedding of the famed swordmaster to the archmage spread quickly, and
much talk of it abounded in the Tower, as well.  Much to my surprise, I was
invited.  The ceremony itself was a formal occasion, but has little bearing
on this recanting.  I must move on, as the protective glow continues to
fade.  

It was a full two years before I saw Leycera again.  I was in my study,
pouring over a text by Tresacran on the theory of elementals when she
appeared suddenly in my doorway.  She cut her usual graceful figure, clad in
shimmering silver robes and radiating excitement.  \#I think I\@ve found it!\# 
She said.  The uncustomary entrance and greeting caught me off-guard, but I
quickly regained my composure and offered her a seat.  Declining, she paced
about the room, speaking rapidly.  

\#I have for some years now been studying ancient artifacts, attempting to
discern their powers, purposes, and whereabouts.  The past year I have
dedicated to finding the Dove of Arafia, an amulet of considerable power. 
And I think I have it!\#  

Leycera continued her rant for some time, and slowly her enthusiam spread to
me.  Apparently, her research had uncovered that the Dove had passed down
the line of Arafia, a line that dwindled in renown as the ages passed. 
Though the story of Arafia\@s descent into the Nether Pits for his lover is
well-known, there are few tales indeed of any heroic deeds performed by his
descendants.  At length the Dove came into the possession of the last of his
line, a simple mine worker living in the realm of Gogoth.  When the foul
King\@s curse fell upon the kingdom, all knowledge of the Dove passed from
mortal memory.  But not if Leycera was to have her way.  She was proposing a
journey to the undead city itself, in search of the Dove.  And she wanted me
along.  
~

When next I saw Leycera, I had grown myself into a respected journeywoman
in the Tower.  She had not in the meantime left the promise of her rapid
ascent unfulfilled, and there was much rumor that she would soon be named an
Archmage.  At the time, I had just finished delivering my thesis on the
Cousten meditation techniques, and was surprised to find her waiting for me
afterwards.  Surprised by her, yes, but even more so by the startling green
eyes of the human behind her.  His face was kindly and bestubbled with a
faint beard.  He comported himself with an unusual grace, and he seemed to
radiate charm.  Prentirn, I recalled, the famed swordmaster.  A quick glance
to the two elegant blades at his sides confirmed the recollection.  But why
was he here?  

Leycera was complimenting me on the thesis.  Bringing my thoughts back to
the present, I flushed slightly in embarrassment.  We conversed for a brief
period, but she never introduced Prentirn or explained her visit.  When I
retired to my chambers that evening, however, it was not her face that
stayed in my mind as I drifted off, but his.  
~

I don\@t know how much longer I have, doubtless only a few hours, so I am
scribbling these pages in the hopes that one day my account might be found. 
Already the shadows draw close about me, and darkness seeks to overwhelm my
fading spirit...  

It all started with Leycera, as most things did.  I first met her when I was
a mere pupil in the Tower of Salyra, when we received among our patients one
afflicted by a blight of the mind that mystified even the more advanced
journeymagi of the guild.  One of the masters recognized it as Void work,
and sent for a magus from the Order of the Silver Light.  

I was tending a nearby patient when Leycera arrived.  Though she was less
than half of my eighteen years, already she was a respected journeywoman of
Spirit magics.  I had heard of her briefly as a rising genius of the Order,
but this was the first I had ever seen her.  Like most of her peculiar race,
her skin was a warm golden color, faintly translucent.  Her hair was long
and silvered, but not the silver of old age that I will not live to see. 
She entered with a grace and power that was evident even to one of my lowly
station, but no trace of haughtiness clouded her presence.  The power she

Rae\@s Happy Place~
Existing entirely in Raestral\@s mind, this wisp of a place is full of
various happy things.  Balloons float by with smiley faces painted on them. 
Little children hold hands and sing together, cuddly kittens meow softly,
nestled against friendly dogs...  Really, it is all rather too much.  A
large table is laid out in one corner, filled with a bountiful surfeit of
food.  A small chess set formed of pure crystal rests on a coffee table. 
Far below lies the beginning of Gogoth\@s Mines.

A Thin Blanched Trail~
This whitened trail seems to spring suddenly from the plains to the east;
even a close inspection would fail to determine its precise beginning.  The
trail is only a few feet wide.  Despite the occasional bits of scrub
speckled around its sides, the trail itself seems devoid of plant life.  The
parched and sandy earth that comprises the path is a slightly paler shade
than the surrounding terrain.  Alongside the trail, a few clumps of a tough
reddish weed attempt to establish a hold in the unforgiving soil.  The trail
fades into the plains to the east, and continues to the west, where it leads
up to the Yagash Mountains.

A Thin Blanched Trail~
Formed of a white and sandy soil, this trail seems utterly devoid of
vegetation.  The foothills of the Yagash Mountains press about you to the
north and south.  Tall as they are, they pale in comparison to the mountains
proper, which loom a short distance to the west.  With the mountains cutting
off wind currents, the air here is remarkably still.  The path slopes very
gently downwards to the west, with no sign of additional life in that
direction.  To the east the trail continues, heading out into the plains.

A gaping aperture opens before you to the west, leading into the Yagash
Mountains.  Two heavy stone supports have been placed at the threshold,
holding up a rotted wooden crossbeam.  Near the opening, a few small plants
attempt to eke out a miserable existence in the dry earth.  The soil here is
of a light color, sandy in texture.  It grows whiter to the east, where a
thin trail leads off through the Yagash foothills.  A steep mountainside
cuts off passage south.  A small building squats just north of the dark

A Mouldering Supply Shed~
This building is hardly more than a shed.  It was clearly once used as a
supply center, for small metal tools litter the floor and counters.  Several
rusted mining pick heads hang from hooks in the walls, their handles rotted
away.  A small drawer is set into the counter beneath them.  There is a
cabinet in the northwest corner of the shed, filled with broken lanterns.  A
small wooden stool sits in the center of the room.  The place reeks of decay
and rot.  One window is evident in the north wall, but it is little more
than a square hole through which light can pass.  A few sketches of the
mining operation are strewn about the place, mostly rotted away.  A
remarkably-intact door leads back to the south, the only apparent exit from
this stifling shed.

The Beginning of a Mine Shaft~
Rough stone walls surround you, dark brown in color.  The ceiling rises
perhaps ten feet from the hard ground.  Bits of rocks are scattered about
the place, and a few stalagmites rise from the ground.  Several mining
implements are littered here, rusted from disuse and time.  A mining cart
filled with dull rocks sits off the side, its wooden wheel rotted through
and crumbling.  The place is rife with shadows, which dance erratically
about the walls as you move.  The entrance to the mines lies to the east
through a wide aperture, while a broad shaft stretches to the west.

A Narrow Mine Shaft~
Hard walls of a dark brown hue narrow in closely about you, leaving only
a half-dozen feet in between them.  Scored by the efforts of many workers
with pickaxes, this shaft has been stripped clean of any valuable gems. 
Fallen bits of rock chipped from the walls lay scattered on the hard ground.
The air is a bit moist here, and on occasion a drip can be heard, the sound
reverberating about the tunnel.  A few stalactites dangle overhead, the
product of many years of mineral buildup from the dripping water.  The shaft
seems to broaden to the east, and extend with about the same width to the
west.  A small passage branches off to the north.

Carved into the dark brown rock that seems prevalent in the mine shaft,
this recess extends only about five feet past the main wall.  Its unscarred
sides seem to have been inextensively mined, as few chips of rock are

Movement here is limited, as the passage is severely constricted in

stone.  The narrow tunnel, dotted with small stone formations, extends to

With the ceiling dipping low and the walls closing in, this part of the
passage provides very little room for movement.  The rough walls become
downright jagged as the tunnel bends to the north and east, and sharp points
jut out at you.  A cool, moist breeze somehow stirs the air here, blowing
gently from the north.  A thin layer of black powder much like soot covers
the walls.  The floor is barren and oddly smooth, its pristine surface
unmarred by debris.  By maneuvering around a sharp edge, one might proceed
to the north or east -- in both directions the ease of passage looks to

mortal hand, with the walls apparently devoid of any gashes.  In fact, they
are strangely smooth.  The prevalent humidity condenses on the walls,
mingling with the soot.  The passage continues to the south, where the

You are in a large cavern of sorts, filled with stone formations which

sparkle with thousands of imbedded bits of some glittery mineral.  The
effect is enhanced by the stark contrast of the black stone which comprises
the bulk of the cavern\@s sides.  A black stone floor extends before you,
free of the rubble that litters other parts of the mine.  A small breeze
moves in here, emanating from the northwest corner of the cavern and bearing
a fair amount of moisture with it.  The air and smooth stone walls are both
cool in temperature.  A thin passageway leads off to the south, and the

The End of a Mining Tunnel~
A claustrophobic would be hard-pressed here, as the ceiling, floor, and
walls slant sharply to meet one another.  The walls are black in color,
seeming to absorb all light that dares to touch them.  The air is
overbearingly still, and the place is filled with an unnatural silence. 
Small stones and chips of rock from the walls cover the hard ground,
crunching underfoot.  Several claw marks are evident on the east wall.

A Steeply-Sloped Tunnel~
At one point this shaft was completely vertical, but a large fall of
rocks has built up into a gravelly slope, permitting easy access to the
deeper parts of the mine.  The north wall of the descending shaft seems to
be composed entirely of the rocky heap, offering the suggestion of having
allowed free passage a long time ago.  Dark brown stone comprises the walls
on the south and the west sides, and seems relatively unmarred by the stroke
of a pickaxe.  The ceiling is adorned with a sort of pulley system, but no
ropes, chains, or devices of any kind are attached to it.  Below you the
mine continues into complete darkness, and the shaft slopes upward to the
east.

A Partially-Mined Passage~
The north and east walls of this passage have been partially scored by
mining pickaxes.  The south side is an oddity, for it is composed not of a
solid slab of rock like most of the walls in the mine, but rather a large
pile of rubble, as if formed in some sort of cave-in.  The black stone walls
are decorated with several bits of some shiny substance, which sparkle in
greater profusion in the most western parts of the passage.  A slight breeze
comes from the west, carrying with it cool, moist air.  It would appear that
a large cavern opens up to the west, but all other sides of this short
tunnel seem impassable.

Long, thin stalactites hang from the ceiling of this black-stoned cavern,
dangling low as if to reach the hard ground.  Other rock formations of
various shapes and sizes serve to further ornament the place, aided in this
endeavor by the sparkles of a thousand tiny deposits of some glittering
mineral set in the walls.  The air is moist, stirred gently by a faint
breeze coming from the west.  The cavern is cool, and the floor uncluttered
with the stone fragments and wall chippings so pervasive in other parts of
the mine.  Extending to the south and west, the cavern\@s expansiveness is
made evident by the echoing sounds of a faint drip of water.  A small

This appears to be the northwest corner of a rather expansive cavern. 
Several stalagmites rise from the ground, formed of black mineral deposits
over a long period of time.  A gentle breeze blows from above, assaulting
you with cool, moist air.  It seems to be coming from a sort of ventilation
shaft which must somehow extend outside to the surface of the Yagash
Mountains.  However, the aperture through which the breeze descends is far
too small to permit entrance.  The floor is a bit damp, but otherwise clear.
On occasion, a dripping sound can be discerned, echoing through the cavern.

You are in what appears to be the southwest corner of a rather large
cavern, dotted with many unusual stone formations.  The walls are formed of
a black stone, decorated by a plethora of minuscule glittering veins of some
shiny mineral.  The floor is clear of debris, and the walls are smooth to

Here the broad mine shaft that runs from the east splits in twain.  One

Several stalagmites rise up from the ground, and a few stalactites grace the

The floor drops out suddenly beneath you, revealing a gaping black pit
descending into the darkness.  The walls of the pit seem unadorned by any
obvious ledges, and the ground below is too far away to make out.  Black
stone walls covered with a sooty film rise up all about you.  Small bits of
a glittering substance decorate them, twinkling infrequently.  Humid air
fills this place, occasionally condensing into water droplets.  Dripping

Black stone comprises the walls here, rough and faintly sooty to the
touch.  Small speckles are imbedded in the rock, glittering faintly.  The
walls seem untouched by mining work, and the hard ground is fairly clear of
debris.  A single large stalagmite thrusts upward, carving the passage in

Small chips of a glittering material are imbedded in the surrounding walls,
twinkling occasionally.  Light black soot forms a thin veneer on the sides
of the passageway, threatening to leave its mark on you.  A dripping sound

The Bottom of a Near-Vertical Shaft~
A large pile of rubble entends upwards from here, reducing what would
otherwise have been a vertical ascent to a steep shaft.  A wooden cage sits
by the southern wall of the shaft, apparently designed to transport miners
up and down.  The chain that once connected its roof to the pulleys far
above has long since rusted away, leaving behind only a heavily oxidized
length of metal.  The air is fairly still down here, bearing with it a
faintly musty taste.  The walls are composed of a dark brown rock that
becomes nearly black in the more northerly part of the shaft.  Navigating
carefully around the pile of rubble, you could enter the tunnel that leads
off to the north.  On all other sides the hard stone walls preclude

makes the atmosphere oppressive.  The walls are cool to the touch and rough,
having been chipped away in many places in the miner\@s relentless search for
ore.  The ground is hard and slightly damp here, making it a bit slick.  The

This part of the mine shaft is straight, though from the gashes ripped

midnight black, yet somehow shadows still manage to play over its surface. 
Moldy and stagnant, the air seems to resist movement as if by a will of its
own.  Despite being somewhat slick, the ground is fairly easy to walk on. 
Infrequently, a bit of shiny mineral will reluctantly glitter from the
shadowy stones that rise up about you on the north and south sides of the

are no longer capable of providing any significant support, a fact evidenced

Burbling softly, a large pool of sticky green ichor fills most of this

Emerald-hued bubbles rise to the surface of the pool, bursting and releasing
an acrid gas into the air with a faint hissing sound.  A sharply acidic
smell fills the place, and bits of the gas cling to you, irritating wherever
it touches.  The ground around the ichor rises only a couple of inches above
it.  Subtle movements are evident in the pool, causing the occasional ripple
to flow out to its perimeter.  The sticky substance gives off a green light,

mortal hands.  A few jewels lie carelessly on the ground, apparently having
been dislodged from the walls by some force.  Many others gleam from their
places amidst the black stone, scattering what light there is about the
walls haphazardly.  The ground is uneven and rough, encrusted with more of
the same precious stones.  A faint moisture hangs about the place, and the
air seems to be still for the most part.  A thin tunnel leads out of the
chamber to the east.

A Straight Mine Shaft~
The southern wall of this mine shaft glitters with a myriad of minuscule
deposits of some sparkling mineral.  Cool to the touch, the wall is rough
and pitted with the marks of many pickaxes.  The air in this passage is dank
and musty, smelling vaguely of mildew.  The level floor is cluttered with
bits and chips of black stone.  The tunnel continues to the east and west,
and a small access passway leads off north.

A Slightly-Sloped Curve in the Mine Shaft~
The mine shaft bends around to the south and west here, the hard black
stone comprising its walls curving smoothly.  Evidence of the mining
operation exists in the form of chips, gashes, and cuts taken almost
haphazardly out of the east and north sides of the passage.  Scattered below
are bits of rock and other debris.  The ground, formed of the same black
rock, is not perfectly level.  The southernmost parts of this bend are
slightly lower than the rest of the tunnel, but the difference is not great.

Near the Chateira Ovulation Chamber~
The oddly-crafted passage bends into a curve here.  Black walls of
unusually smoothened stone form a circular tunnel, unmarred by the clumsy
work of a pickaxe.  There is a potent aroma of rot in the air, the reek
seeming to drift in from the north.  From that same direction comes a rapid
progression of soft clacking sounds.  The tunnel ascends gradually and
widens into a small cavern to the north, as well as continuing straight to

The Chateira Ovulation Chamber~
A massive heap of bodies has been piled in the center of this cavern,
reeking most foully.  Composed of a wide array of corpses, the pile seems to
have been indiscriminately thrown together.  Some of the corpses even appear
to be chateira forms, their many legs hanging limply in death.  Scurrying
all about the cavern are many live specimens of this singular race. 
Periodically, one of these will mount the heap of cadavers and sink an
ovipositor into one of the limp forms, leaving its eggs to grow in the
nourishment of the rotting flesh.  The ensuing oophagia amongst the other
chateirae soon makes it clear why this race has not managed to explode
violently in number.  Two tubular passageways branch off this foul-smelling
cavern -- one to the south, the other to the east.

Black stone walls line this passage, occasionally glittering with a hint

permitting comfortable passage.  Pickaxe gashes score the sides of the
tunnel, telling of the hard manual labor put forth by those long since gone.

From below the sound of dripping water echoes, the sound bouncing around

sharply downward in a steep decline, the bottom of which seems to curve
about to the west.  Few marks are evident on the walls, as the rich deposits

A Side Passage Near the Chateira Ovulation Chamber~
This small side tunnel halts suddenly to the east, a black stone wall
rising up to impede progress.  A few corpses lay scattered hither and yon
about the passage, blood trails indicating that they were dragged from the
main chamber to the west.  Most of these forms seem filled with chateira
eggs, apparently somewhat safer from the crunching mandibles of adult
chateirae than those in the main chamber.  One or two bodies, however, seem
relatively unsullied as of yet.  Much like the chamber to the west, this
passage is smeared with gore and body fluids from a variety of races.  No
exit is obvious, save to the main ovulation grounds to the west.

A powerful downdraft of wind forces bits of rock and other small objects

is surprisingly soft, the usual hard stone covered by a thin layer of loamy
black soil.  This dirt is slightly damp, and indeed, the whole passage is a
bit humid.  From the west echoes the sound of dripping water.  Dark brown
stone walls rise up on all sides save west, where a passage leads off.  A
faint trail of blood runs down the slope, but is lost to sight when it runs
into the obscuring dirt.  The walls seem to be gashed half-heartedly in this

A Heavily-Mined Shaft~
At one point a very lucrative vein of some precious material must have
run through here, or seemed to, as the walls of this shaft are heavily
gouged and scored by the work of miners.  The trail of gashes in the soft
grey stone indicates that the intense mining operation halted suddenly to
the north, resuming a normal pace.  Whatever it may have been that the
miners sought, little trace of it remains now, as the walls are quite
lusterless and barren of any obvious precious minerals.  The air here is
cool and a bit damp.  The density of pickaxe marks continues with the shaft
to the east.

A Heavily-Mined Shaft~
A myriad of deep gashes have been scored into the grayish black stone
that forms the walls of this passage.  Whatever rich vein the original
miners saw here has long since been extracted, however, and little remains
now but the bare rock.  The air is cool and fairly dry, though it feels a
bit moister to the west.  The hard stone floor is fairly uncluttered despite
the obvious workings in the wall.  These workings continue to the west
without losing any of their remarkable density, and the other end of the
tunnel leads south.

This passage slopes down into the darkness below.  A faint mist roils in
from the east, causing some condensate to form on the hard stone ground. 
Walls of grey stone line the passage, stripes of white running through them.
A lone stalactite dangles from the ceiling, formed of the same grey stone
with white striations.  The slanted passage can be followed down into the

The Top of a Vertical Shaft~
A sheer drop into darkness is evident before you, the bottom not visible
from this vantage point.  Handholds have been fastened into the sides,
providing for passage into the depths.  Despite the rust that covers them,
the handholds seem sturdy enough.  A faint chill wafts up from below,
mingling with the warmer air from the passage that lies to the south.  Here,
the air is relatively dry, and the dark brown walls lack the sheen that

A Small Recess in the Grey Stone~
This small alcove has been carved by some natural or mortal force into
the grey walls, recessed perhaps four feet into the side of the passage. 
Just under the low ceiling a dark square indicates the presence of some sort
of crawlspace -- however, the steep incline renders wriggling through it from
below nearly impossible.  A faint chill seems to issue forth from the
square, addressing more than just the physical in its frigidity.  A few feet
south the recess empties back out into the main tunnel.

The outstanding feature of this chamber of indeterminate size is the
complete darkness which fills it, banishing any glimmer of light with an
otherworldly force.  Any attempts at light quickly fail as if drawn away
from their source by some targetting power.  Faint rustling sounds echo
about the chamber, but fail to give much indication of how expansive the
place might be.  The ground feels hard and unyielding.  No walls are within
reach -- the cavern seems to simply expand indefinitely.  The ground feels
oddly wooden at your feet.

sides of the passage is lined with chalky-white striations.  The ground is

The Bottom of a Vertical Shaft~
You are at the bottom of a tall shaft which rises to some indiscernable
height above you.  The walls forming the shaft are of a reddish stone, but
seem to grow browner higher up.  Several rusty metal handholds are imbedded
into the wall, providing for passage up and down the shaft.  Though clearly
ancient, the handholds nonetheless appear rather sturdy.  Little else in the
shaft would indicate the presence of mining efforts, as there is a notable
absence of gouges in the walls, pickaxe heads, or any other such evidence.

A Curved Tunnel of Red Stone~
The dull red rock lining this bending passage is fairly soft and crumbly,
and several small piles of red sand are evident on the floor.  Thin bands of
a deeper red are interspersed in the stone.  The ground is not formed from
the same material, but rather from a grey rock that borders on dark green. 
The air is very dry here, and has grown musty with long periods of
stagnancy.  The ceiling is low, rising only about six feet from the floor. 
There exists no immediately-apparent evidence of mining efforts here.  The
passage runs east to a vertical shaft, and south into a chamber.

the past or current presence of other mortal beings.  From the north comes a

for near the east wall.  There, the stone forms into a sort of pedestal.

up against the north wall.  The tunnel curves to the east.

Within the Mists~
You are within the mists that cover the ground in this cavern.  The dark
shadows of rock formations loom about you, and the mists swirl and curl with
each movement.  The air is unnaturally humid here, and it is nearly
impossible to draw a satisfying breath.  Dark shapes move subtly on each
side of you.

A Cave Full of Jewels~
Hundreds of gems adorn the walls of this cavern, glinting and sparkling. 
Some of them seem to be self-luminescent, and the combined effort of their
glow illuminates the place.  Many of the jewels are yet encrusted in the ore
that contains them, but several have also broken mostly free.  These scatter
the light in the chamber, causing a dazzling display of colors to dance on
the stone walls.  Even the floor and ceiling are encrusted with rubies,
diamonds, and other gems, formed over some long expanse of time under the
high pressure of the Yagash Mountains.  The chamber is remarkably unmined,
and seems to have been formed naturally.  To the north a passage slants
upwards into the mines.

A Cave Full of Jewels~
The walls of this small cave are covered with glittering gems and
precious stones, jutting out at odd angles.  Several of these valuable rocks
have wormed their way loose over time, and now rest impatiently on the
ground, eager to be collected.  Others seem only loosely attached to the ore
in which they are embedded, and could likely be pried out.  Despite the
beauty of the cave, an oddly heavy air hangs over it, suffusing the place
with a very faint aura of wrongness.  To the north the ground slopes upward,
leading into wetter climes.

Within a Suction Tube~
You are being swept along in this rather extensive tube, bouncing and
careening off the hard stone walls.  The tube is formed of a shiny black
rock, and is sloped for quite some distance to the north.  If the walls were
less smooth, few creatures would survive the extreme buffeting concomitant
with this extensive fall.  The powerful suction maintains its steady pull,
defeating any attempts of escaping upwards or even controlling one\@s flight.

Underneath a Suction Tube~
A powerful current of air presses down on you from above, making movement
difficult.  The current comes from a sort of suction tube, formed of a
smooth black stone.  No end is apparent in the tube, as it bends up to the
south for quite some distance.  Bits of debris are scattered near the sides
of this passage, apparently blasted away from the center by the wind gusts. 
Amidst this debris are various crushed bones and other evidences of
passerbys who came to terms with fate after a trip in the suction tube.  The
tunnel continues to the east.

Within the Dark Mists of Sleep~
Dark mists swirl all about you in this place, obscuring vision for more
than perhaps half a foot.  The air is damp and chill, and a certain sense of
hollowness seems to pervade your surroundings.  Natural light here is all
but absent, consisting completely of a very faint glow which is nearly
swallowed in its entirety by the preternatural gloom.

Code Changes in New Build -- Suggestions~
* Make it so ghosts cannot die except in certain circumstances
* Allow all commands usually done by an imm -- from bg reading to
  initiating/deinitiating snoops to statting to note reading -- to be
  done by an imm while switched.  
* ^ also wiznet stuff ^ 
* [Dov] Make the time/lunar/weather systems function correctly and
  allow for prog interaction based on them.  
* [Dov] Real-world physics like air and water room autochecking for
   dropping/falling/sinking if there are down exits. 
* [Dov] Have a working act_prog -- it could really simplify a lot of
  messy prog triggering.  
* [Dov] add a \@contiguous areas\@ field to the the area files 
* [Dov] get rid of shopkeeper hours, or make non-open shoppies 
  \@go home\@/wizi/somesuch.  
* [Iandir] ability to reload areas instantly, including items 
* [Iac] A one-week delay on delete, putting a character on semi-deleted 
  hold.  To let people cool down.  
* [Iac] More stratification of spells into greater/lesser 
* A \@sheathe\@ command that frees the wield wearslots, with a memory
  of the weapons sheathed (for automatic wielding in case of combat).
* Make it so that you can sleep on a mat in your inventory, and when
  you stand up it goes back into your inv.
* [Dov] a \@journal\@ command that would show TONS of stats, such
  as top 5 groupmates, top 5 NPCs killed, PK stats, top 5 areas.
  Could be an account bonus?
* http://www.avendar.com/avendarbible/wiki.pl?Guilds_And_Levelless_Classes_For_Av_2.0
* [Dov] Make the School of Heroes more IC (replace newb exits with progs?)
* [Iac] Make wall exit-flags, so ch\@taren can run through them.
* Diversify spell parameters, add spell-type flags to each spell.
* [Kor] Implement the spell system as a database parser, with spells
  (their side-affects and echoes) as entries in a database.  Allow
  builders access to a spell-editor to add custom spell entries.
* [Kor] Keep a hash table of spell names for progging purposes, so
  that builders can refer directly to spell names instead of having
  to look up spell numbers.
* [Kor] XML-like tagging syntax for prog arguments, instead of static
  syntax.  e.g., mpaddaffect (spellnum) 30 -->
  mpaddaffect level=\@30\@ spell=\@spellname\@ foo=\@bar\@ otherarg=\@whatever\@
* [Iac] Autotagging of vnums into name fields of objs/mobs
* [Iac] Hardcoded warnings (to players) and flags (for imms) for the more
  common rule violations - TMR, off-account, multikilling, etc.
