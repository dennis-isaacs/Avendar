cow dairy spotted white black~
a dairy cow~
A spotted cow placidly chews her cud.
~
This large white cow is covered all over with irregular black spots.  Her
head is mostly black, including her long ears, with a band of white down the
middle of her face.  Her udders hang low, and her tail swings about idly,
swatting at flies.  She reacts little to most activity nearby, occasionally
flicking a liquid brown eye at passers by.  A ring pieces her right ear, a
waxed parchment tag hanging from it.

A black-faced sheep with curly white wool mills about.
~
A compact but fully grown sheep mills about here, chewing at whatever
happens to take its interest at any given moment.  Its face and legs are
black, and it has long ears that extend out to the side before flopping
forward a little.  Its wool is thick and curly, overall white though darker
in front from dirt.  It bleats and baas with relative frequency, at things
it notices, at other sheep, and sometimes apparently just because.

a furry taenosil~
A furry little taenosil inspects the grass.
~
This furry animal is about the size of a rabbit or housecat, with long
ears that flop in front of its face.  It has a more tapered face than a
rabbit, however, with eyes that face forward rather than the sides.  Its
legs are quite short and stubby with small, four-toed paws and no
appreciable claws to be seen.  Its tail is a small, sleek triangle of fur
that hangs downwards, not far enough to reach the ground.  This one is
covered all over in bright orange fur, excepting its white belly.

>data_prog fuzzy~
Unlike most of its fellows, this round-bodied little taenosil\@s fur has a
bit of a kink to it, giving its soft, black fur a velvet-like texture to it.
Aside from the fuzz to its fur, it seems like any other taenosil, with long,
floppy ears and stubby legs with tiny feet.  It munches on grasses that
catch its attention, and sniffs at foreign or interesting smells.  From time
to time it noses at nearby toys.  
~
>data_prog white-bellied~
A round-bodied taenosil roams about here, ears flopping against its face
as it wanders around the fields.  Its fur is a golden brown, darker at the
roots than the tips, giving it a slightly wilder look, but its belly is a
soft, creamy white.  Its eyes are dark, shining red when light hits them
just so, which only adds to that wildness.  The look aside, however, it
appears quite tame, placidly chewing at grass or toys that catch its fancy. 
~
>data_prog white-crested~
A squat little taenosil is here, with short, stubby legs, a plump belly,
and long, floppy ears.  Its fur is a soft, velvety black all over, with a
white, roughly circular crest standing out on its forehead.  Below are its
dark blue eyes, the colour standing out more due to that patch of white fur.
It romps around the field, appearing totally carefree as it moves from toy
to toy or nibbling at grasses.  
~
>data_prog spotted~
This round, furry taenosil is about the size of a rabbit with short,
stubby legs and small feet.  Its head is all black, to the tips of its long,
floppy ears, but the rest of its body is white, covered over with little
black spots.  It roams around, chewing at foliage that interests it, small
tail twitching a little as it moves.  Noises seems to frighten it, causing
it to run for perceived cover when it hears loud enough sounds.  
~
>data_prog gold-furred~
Housecat-sized but shaped far more cylindrically, stubby legs aside, this
particular taenosil covered in fur of a rich, amber-gold.  Its nose twitches
as it sniffs at things near to it, inspecting them with big blue eyes.  It
scuttles around more quickly than its round shape, short legs, and tiny feet
would suggest, letting it run quickly from loud noises.  Its long, floppy
ears brush near to the ground, twitching a little as it hears things.  
~
>data_prog black~
About the size of a rabbit but with a round, cylindrical body, this
taenosil is covered with a short, satiny black fur all over.  Its eyes
match, dark and curious, allowing it to inspect most anything close to eye
level.  Lacking any appreciable neck, it seems unable to look up very well. 
Its ears are long and floppy, falling forward against its face to almost
drag against the ground.  Occasionally it extends a pink tongue to lick at
grass or toys.  
~
>data_prog tortoiseshell~
A plump, rabbit-sized taenosil wanders about here, investigating scents
or sights close enough to the ground for it to see.  Its particoloured fur
is all orange, white, and black, even on its long, floppy ears.  Its short
little legs and feet are all white, somewhat greyed from close contact with
grass and dirt.  A short black tail twitches a little as it wanders around,
and it chews at whatever attracts its interest.  The fur seems brushed
regularly, which fuzzes the pattern of its coat a little.  
~
>data_prog long-haired~
Supposedly, this is a taenosil, but it looks more like a rabbit-sized
dustmop than an animal, except where it moves on its own.  Its black fur is
luxuriantly long, puddling against the ground in waves.  By the sheen to the
fur and its lack of matting or tangles, it must see extremely regular
grooming.  The only thing that allows you to tell one end from the other is
the long, floppy ears that grace its head, whose fur is much shorter, with a
velvety shine.  
~
>data_prog dark-nosed~
This housecat-sized taenosil is all-over with short, cream-coloured fur. 
At its nose, ears, tail, and feet, the fur fades to a rich, chocolatey
brown, and its eyes are a bright, light red.  It waddles around the yard,
sniffing and everything that presents itself before its dark nose, and
chewing at whatever passes its internal standard of tastiness.  Its tail
seems a bit longer than most of its brethern, reaching nearly to the ground.
Its legs are quite stubby but it moves with surprising speed when some noise
or shadow startles it.  
~
>data_prog silver-grey~
This squat little taenosil looks a bit larger than its fellows, but that
largely seems to be on account of its medium-length, silvery grey fur which
adds a fair bit of puff to its size and shape.  Its long ears flop forward
against its face which flattens the fur enough to more easily see its
inquisitive dark eyes.  The fur seems regularly groomed, free of mats and
tangles, even on its belly which presses almost against the ground.  
~
>data_prog red-banded~
About the size of a housecat or rabbit, this squat little taenosil roams
relatively freely about the yard.  Its soft, smooth fur is red and white;
its midsection and a stripe down the centre of its flat face are white,
while its back half and either side of the face, including its luxuriantly
floppy ears are an orangey red.  Its legs are stubby and low to the ground,
and its tiny feet seem to have no appreciable claws.  While it has an
inquisitive face, as such things go, it seems poorly-equipped to regard much
above eye level.

The End of a Dirt Path~
A dirt road meanders from east to a stop here, a paved city square
visible back to the east of you.  Little houses have sprung up to the north
and south of the road here, made of wood and brick.  A tree or two lines the
road as well, offering a measure of shade for passers-by.  Little dust rises
from the road here, leaving the air clean and crisp.  Past both the houses,
the grasslands rise up again as far as the eye can see, and beyond where the
road drifts to a halt in the west, the vague suggestion of another road can
be seen.

This small brick house is tidily kept and well-decorated.  Thick rugs
cover the floor, faded from use but showing colourful patterns.  The windows
are paned in bubbled but mostly clear glass, split into smaller sections by
strips of lead.  A woodstove and fireplace serve to heat the home and
provide a place to cook, where various oil lamps provide steady light after
dark.  Shelves hold odds and ends, and little tables throughout hold flowers
and other display pieces.  The front door of the house is to the south.

A Wooden House~
A small wooden house, this place looks a bit lived-in, but otherwise in
good shape.  Most of the floor is bare, polished wood, but old rugs cover
some spots to protect the feet.  Bubbled glass windows offer an only
somewhat distorted view of the dirt road to the north.  The home is brightly
lit by small lamps with no evident source of fuel, and the stove by the
fireplace seems to be of the same make.  An old wooden desk sits almost by
itself in one room, piled high with sheets of parchment, a nearby cabinet
holding more still.  The front door to the home is on the north side.

seeming well-traveled by the residents of this small village.  Buildings
line the road, with flowerbeds in front of some of them.  A tree or two
lines the road as well, offering a measure of shade for passers-by.  The
road travels from the square southwards, several houses surrounding it
there.  Little dust rises from the road here, leaving the air clean and
crisp.

giving an exotic flair to the stylings of the room.  The windows are covered
by clear magical fields, covered with airy curtains.  A woodstove and
fireplace serve to warm the house, most of the light throughout provided by
glowing stone spheres.  The other furnishings are plainer, made from local
woods and fabrics, with little other sign of foreign influence.  The door of
the house is to the north.

by thin wooden strips.  The curtains are thin and light throughout, and the
chairs upholstered with rich, padded leather.  A few houseplants sit
well-tended in the common areas of the house, brightening the decor
considerably.  A wooden fireplace sits against one wall, on both levels of
the house.  The front door is to the east.

artificial creek runs up near to the other side of the fence to the east,
and cornfields start further beyond that.  The scent of sheep dominates the
air here, and the ground is dotted with hidden clumps of manure.  Southeast
stands a large farmhouse, and to the south, the paddock opens onto a barn
painted dark red.

A Small, Neat Bedroom~
This room is not large, with only enough space to readily hold a
relatively large bed, a polished wardrobe, and worn old rocking-chair.  A
wicker basket sits next to the chair, holding several balls of yarn,
knitting needles sticking out the top.  The wardrobe looks relatively new,
and is intricately, if not expertly carved, and polished to a warm shine. 
The bed is piled high with thick, knitted blankets, some of a greyish,
undyed wool, and the topmost brightly-dyed in a variety of cheery colours. 
A small, wooden door leads to the south.

A Communal Living Space~
This large room appears to serve as mutual living quarters for a large
number of farmhands, sectioned off partially to allow each some privacy, if
little space.  A fireplace stands on the edge of the room to west, a small
stove nearby, allowing farmhands to prepare simple meals for themselves. 
There is little decoration to the room as a whole, though a few beds have
some small keepsakes and personal effects by them.  A door leads to the
north into a barn, and to the east is the main room of the house.

A Small Vegetable Patch~
A small vegetable patch has been laid out here, a number of different
crops set out in neat rows.  While not enough to be producing vegetables for
sale, this patch is too large for a single family to eat easily, even
allowing for storage.  A number of hutches are visible a good ways to the
north, making whatever animals that lie within a likely candidate for the
excess.  A tall, brightly-painted house stands to the northeast, and a
grey-cobbled patio close to the north.

The Upper Level of a Farmhouse~
The upper storey of this house is divided into two levels, and each level
divided into halves.  A thin ladder leads to the upper level, though it
shows little signs of use.  Each little section encloses a small,
well-appointed bedroom, each decorated in the varying tastes and styles of
their occupants.  Small paintings hang on the dividing walls, inexpensively
but tastefully framed.  Another ladder, similarly unused-looking, leads down
to a lower level.

Among them are vividly-painted cityscapes, some recognizably of Earendam,
and others of a tall, many-towered city by a mountain, the sky bright and
blue, on a vast disc without any ground in sight.  The portraits are done in
modern illusory techniques rather than paint, showing pictures of
well-dressed aelin in homey settings.

bedroom bedrooms section sections room rooms~
This part of the house has been divided into four bedrooms on two levels,
each having a large, soft bed.  The blankets are thickly quilted in a sleek
fabric, in a variety of dark but tasteful colours.  One of the rooms is
stocked with a variety of toys; a collection of spheres that spin and
sparkle when touched, a porcelain doll with real hair and feathered wings
and a variety of tiny clothes for it to wear, and a fanciful stuffed animal
made from sleek grey silk with comically huge ears and a long nose stand out
most amongst the collection.  Other rooms are more simply decorated, with
well-stocked bookshelves and illusory portraits of well-dressed aelin.

Several bedrooms comprise this section of the house, none large but all
having enough space to be comfortable.  A central sitting room extends to
the back of the house, a large window offering an unrelieved view of the
grasslands, stretching out as far as the eye can see.  Dried flowers
decorate the walls and add a faint scent to the hallway, adding faded colour

several less-perishable items hang from the ceiling.  A large, round table
provides a communal place to eat, with comfortably padded chairs posed

A Spacious Living Area~
Several bedrooms are clustered around a central space, each fairly
spacious and showing signs of use and care.  The furniture is carved and
varnished applewood, of a very fine make.  Each of the bedrooms has a window
paned in glass, though only in the largest is the glass of particular
clarity; the others are bubbled and give a somewhat flawed view of the
outside.  They serve well enough to provide reasonable views of the
outdoors, though, giving glimpses of the orchard and yard outside.  The main
rooms of the house are through a door to the west.

A Wooden Hut~
This house is constructed entirely of wood except for the pale stone
fireplace against one wall.  It is not very large, being only one room, and
looks to accomodate a single person.  An unadorned bed sits in the corner,
near to an uncommonly well-stocked bookshelf.  In one corner is a rack
holding empty earthenware pots, lengths of candle wicking, a pile of wooden
frames, and assorted other tools.  A metal vat with a crank sits near to it
too, and a separate woodstove with a wax-stained metal pot.  Away from that
part of the house, a thick blue carpet covers the floor, faded from use. 
There are numerous windows, letting a great deal of light into the house. 
The front door is to the east.

The Earendam Road~
The Earendam Road widens here, with well-traveled dirt shoulders and a
grassy ditch on either side.  Fencing can be seen to begin here, separating
the wild grasslands from more cultivated fields.  The stone paving that
makes up the main road seems well-maintained, compared to further south,

The road here is of well-trodden and hard-packed dirt, ditches on either
side with some standing water in the bottoms.  Fencing provides a border to
fields on either side, but northwards is a gated gap, a solid wooden bridge
over the ditch, a dirt track winding its way through it and onto the
farmland.  Cattle can be seen milling about the pastures to the south, and
cornfields stretch out a long ways to the northeast.  The road makes its
flat way along to the east, and comes to an intersection to the west.

A dirt track winds its way north and south, here, a cornfield stretching
out to the east.  A stretch of pasture stands to the west, fenced in from
the track.  A large house stands off to the north, a barn nearby to it, too.
The faint sounds of sheep can be heard from the pasture, and the smell of
their leavings reaches your nostrils, far enough off and faint enough to not
be an assault on the senses.

hearth.  Well-worn rugs cover the hardwood floors, and oil lamps hang from
the walls about the room.  A small bookshelf sits on one wall, holding a few
books and more tchotchkes.  Several curtained windows allow light through
oiled-parchment panes, and a single pane of lovingly-polished glass sits in
a small window that looks out on the cornfields.  A kitchen stands off to

several meats and vegatables hang from the ceiling.  A small figurine sits

pen large enough to house a small herd of sheep sits in the southeast
corner.  A thin ladder leads up to a hayloft, piled with golden hay. 
Several bins with heavy lids take up most of the space on the main level of
the barn, long hemp ropes holding them shut.  The barn opens off onto a dirt

A Dirt Path Outside A Farmhouse~
A rutted dirt track opens up into a fork here, continuing straight to the
north and splitting to meander southwesterly to a barn, and straight south
leading to a farmhouse.  Outside the house, someone has taken the time to
pave the road over somewhat with smooth stones, but the project seems
incomplete, and only goes on ten feet or so.  The house seems freshly
painted, all on one floor and sprawling out, made with a mixture of clay
bricks, stone, and wood, depending on the apparent age of each section.

An Open Farmhouse~
This large, open room serves as a common area for this farmhouse, a
fireplace and woodstove off to the side, and a trapdoor leading to a small
coldroom.  Tables and chairs are set about to allow people to eat, and other
furniture provides places to relax.  Large windows ensure the room is
generously lit during the day, and candles and lamps are set about, giving
the room a warm, homey feel.  A door leads into the farmhands\@ quarters to
the west, and southwards is a door to the family\@s personal living space.

A Curve in a Dusty Road~
The road turns to a wooden bridge over an irrigation ditch for a small
space here, then curves around a wide, smooth pond.  A cornfield lies
further northwest, and pasture land southwest.  Southeast the land becomes
more uncultivated, tall-grassed prairie beyond the road.  To the northeast,
though, you can see a small farm in the distance, and the rutted, dusty road
curves northward here towards it.  To the west, the road stretches out
straight as far as the eye can see.

A Dusty Road by a Pond~
The road here is of well-trodden and hard-packed dirt, a ditch on the
eastern side and an irrigation pond on the west.  A small wooden bridge
crosses the ditch, allowing entrance to the farmland to the east.  The road
too is slightly arched over a tunnel for water from the pond to flow
through.  The air is a bit dusty from the road, but the closeness of the
pond ensures only the stiffest breezes make it a problem.  The road is
lightly rutted, but shows little signs of heavy wheeled traffic.

irrigation pond~
A pond sits to the west of the road.  Though the lay of the land makes
the pond itself and thin stream that spiders off it to the north appear to
be natural, the ditches that extend from it are clearly not.  Clusters of
reeds near the edges of the pond provide places for wildlife to hide.

A Cobbled Path Near a Farmhouse~
The grass here looks to be a mixture of clover and timothy, kept
relatively close to the ground compared to the foliage on the other side of
the ditch.  A wooden fence provides a border to the land to the south and
west, gated in that direction.  A path paved over with smooth grey stones
meanders east and west over the land here, turning to dirt past the gate.  A
fence comes right to the ground to the north, but only about three feet
tall.  A cheerily-painted farmhouse is off to the east, along with another
small outbuilding.

A Pasture of Clover~
This pasture is grassed primarily with timothy and clover, and appears to
be regularly trimmed, further cropped close by animals.  The pasture is
fenced in on all sides but to the east, the fence low to the ground, leaving
no space beneath it.  Despite obviously being grazing land for animals,
there is little evidence of stool on the ground.  There seem to be numerous
wooden boxes strewn about the pasture as well, holes cut in them.  Several
balls of woven straw roll lightly around the grass.  A cobbled path is past
the fence to the south, and what looks like a number of hutches are off to
the east.

Numerous boxes are strewn about the yard, wide and low though some appear

have holes cut into them, large enough for an animal about the size of a
rabbit to fit into and hide inside.  They have been brightly painted, all
different colours.

By a Collection of Hutches~
A number of wooden hutches are set around a central yard here, with low
ramps leading down onto the mixed timothy and clover grass.  A canvas awning
protects the hutches from the elements above, with some long ties that can
be used to take it down with ease.  A couple large sheds sit behind the
hutches, and some bales of hay sit on some wooden racks above the ground,
with a sack of some other sort of feed on top of one bale.  A pasture
continues to the west, and a gate in the fence to the south allows passage
to the path out to the front of a cheerily-painted house.

Several hutches with wire mesh fronts are set about this yard, each lined

are spacious, able to accomodate animals the size perhaps of a large cat or
small dog in comfort.  Most of them have chewed wooden blocks inside, and
small blocks of some sort of mineral as well.

Outside a Painted House~
A path cobbled with smooth grey stones opens off into a patio of sorts
here, out front of a tall, brightly-painted house.  Flowerbeds sit out
front, and the wide bright windows are filled by barely-perceptible magical
fields.  A polished wooden cart sits to the south of the patio, made of a
silvery wood clearly not native to the region.  The house stands to the
east, and the path to the west.  Northwards is a number of hutches, and to
the south appears to be a small vegetable patch.

A Tall Farmhouse~
This farmhouse is built tall and narrow, split into three visible levels.
The main floor houses a dining area and large, well-appointed kitchen.  The
windows are sealed to the outside by faint magical fields and the rooms are
lit with bright orbs of light.  A sitting area is on a wide loft, reachable
by a thin ladder.  Comfortable low-backed couches sit about a coffee table
that holds a fragrant vase of flowers.  Another ladder leads up to a more
proper second floor, and the front door to the house is on the western wall.

upper sitting couch couches flowers vase coffee table~
The upper section of this floor is a wide loft that overlooks the dining
area, with a polished wooden railing preventing any falls.  A thin ladder
leads up to it but it seems to see little use.  The couches in the sitting
area are butter-soft black leather with polished brass studs, overstuffed
and soft.  The coffee table is a foreign, silvery-grey wood, much like other
furniture in the house, and atop it is a sweepingly-moulded vase, filled
with exotic flowers.  
~
E
lower kitchen dining~
The lowest part of this home seems devoted to dining and food
preparation.  The table and chairs are made with a silvery-grey wood not
native to the region, and magically shaped, rather than carved, into a
fluid, swooping design.  The kitchen is well-stocked and cooler than the
other half of the floor, small statuettes marked with runes of ice and
water.

A Dusty Road~
The road here is of well-trodden and hard-packed dirt, ditches on either
side with some standing water in the bottoms.  Fencing provides a border to
fields on either side, but southwards is a gated gap, a solid wooden bridge
over the ditch.  A dirt track winds its way through it and onto the
farmland.  Sheep can be seen milling about the pastures to the north, and
the sound and scent of pigs wafts from the southwest.  The road makes its
flat way along to the west, and comes to an intersection to the east.

A Rutted Path~
A heavily rutted path stretches to the north and south here, dirt tightly
packed from steady usage.  The air is thick with the smell of pigs, but the
breeze trends brisk enough to keep the scent moving.  A fence stands to the
west, bordering off a grassy pigpen, and a larger fence separates the
farmland from road to the north and east.  A farmhouse is off in the
distance to the south, and a barn beside it.  The path itself leads there
southwards, and back to the north where it meets the road.

A Partially Grassed Lot~
Much of the grass in this field has been worn away, leaving patchy spots
of brown in places.  The leavings of pigs are strewn throughout the lot,
though the majority seems to be in the northwestern corner.  The odor here
is almost oppressive, but regular maintenance and the breeze ensure it does
not overwhelm.  The yard is fenced in on all sides but south, with roads
past ditches to the north and west.  The lot continues to the south, coming
under an overhang, and a rutted dirt path lies past the fence to the east.

A Large Pigpen~
There is little grass at all in this pigpen, most of it having been torn
up from steady attentions by pigs.  A mud-filled wallow is enclosed by brick
here, and a large wooden enclosure provides a relatively indoor location for
pigs to congregate.  A wooden overhang extends from the edge of the
enclosure, providing a measure of shade.  A tightly-secured shack sits off
to the side.  A fence and a ditch block passage to the road to the west, but
the fence to the east is low enough that one can easily cross to the rutted
path that way.  The pen grows grassier to the north, and a gate in the fence
to the south leads to a number of outbuildings.

In Front of a Brick Farmhouse~
A heavily rutted path stretches northward from here, coming to an end out
front of a large brick farmhouse.  The telltale scent of pigs is in the air,
coming from the pigpen over to the west.  Runes have been etched around the
doors and windows of the house, looking fresh and clearly marked.  Some
grass lines the pathway on either side, but most of it has been worn away. 
A few flowerbeds sit out front of the house, some looking better-kept than
others.  The front door of the house is to the south.

A Brick Farmhouse~
Though this house sprawls out a ways, with large rooms and a good-sized
kitchen, it nonetheless has a cozy feel to it.  The walls are plastered-over
brick, and painted warm, inviting colours.  Despite the hog farm outside,
there is little evidence of their telltale aroma.  There is some evidence of
prosperity in the decor; several windows have been paned with glass, and the
kitchen and sitting areas are lit by spheres of light, rather than oil
lamps.  The front door is to the north, and bedrooms to the south.

A Collection of Outbuildings~
A number of small buildings are clustered here, each only of a size to
provide living space for a single person each.  They all are painted a dull
red, and roofed with clay tile and the windows are thick oiled parchment. 
There is little decoration on the outside of the buildings, though a few
have runes painted around the doorframes.  The wall of a house is to the
east, and to the west is a fence blocking access to a road.  The air is
thick with unpleasant odors, largely from the pigpen to the north, but an
acrid tang to the air comes from the southwest.

tract of farmland.  Sheep can be seen milling about the pastures in the
distance to the northeast, and you can see, hear, and smell pigs to the
south.  The road makes its flat way along to the west, and comes to an
intersection to the east.

A Grassy Path~
A dirt path is here, grassed over on the edges.  Ruts are visible in the
path, as well as tracks from numerous hoofed animals.  A distinct sheepy
aroma fills the air here, and some tufts of wool are stuck here and there to
the fence to the east.  Bleats and baas can be heard from the pasture on the
other side.  Despite the fence, it seems little impedence to any save the
livestock.  A dusty road is over a small bridge to the south, and the path
continues to the north.

A Grassy Pasture~
This large, slightly hilly pasture is a mixture of vibrant grasses and
herbs, rolling for quite a ways to the north.  As all the other land within
sight is flat, the hills are certainly artificial.  The pasture is fenced in
on three sides, road to the south and east, deep ditches serving as a border
and for irrigation.  The fence to the west seems more passable, a grass and
dirt track past it.  The pasture continues to the north, and you can see a

Before a White Farmhouse~
A partially grassed-over trail comes to a top in front of a whitewashed
farmhouse with blue trim here.  Two short, bushy trees have a line of cable
strung between them, and a good-sized doghouse sits near to them.  The scent
of sheep reaches your nose from the meadow to the east, a fence separating
it from this area.  Some of the house\@s visible windows are paned in glass,
through which lacy curtains can be seen.  The house can be entered through
the door to the north, and the path leads to the south.  One can also move
to the eastern pasture.

house in miniature.  A large cushion sits inside, flattened through use.

cable clothesline trees~
A sturdy clothesline, wooden pegs clinging to it, hangs between two trees

hayloft, along with the obvious bales of hay and straw.  The air is filled
with the particularly wooly scent of sheep and goats, and telltale bits of
fleece and hair can be seen wedged into cracks in the fencing.  The building
seems constructed to allow a great deal of circulation, and there seems much
evidence of animal traffic moving freely in and out of the barn.  A slightly
hilly pasture lies to the south.

A Small Tannery~
A long trail through the grasslands leads from the north to this tannery,
the reason for the distance from other obvious habitation made clear by the
putrid aroma that carries down the road.  Much of the operation seems
open-air to mitigate the smell, but a wide, low building is here as well. 
Inside and out, there are vats of foul-smelling liquids and racks for
stretching, drying and scraping hides.  A large rack sits elevated a foot or
two off the ground near the entrance to the tannery, for holding fresh
hides.

standing brightly out from the flat prairie.  The houses of a small village
start to crop up around this part of the road, and a main market square is
to the west.  More easterly, this road comes to an intersection, branching
to the south.  The air is fresh and clear here, far enough away from the
farms to bring little trace of the scent of farms.

Unlike the dirt road to the east, this square is cobbled over with grey
stones with few gaps between them.  A wide, expansive area, the square
continues every way but back onto that dirt road.  Buildings surround the
cobbled ground, made from inconsistent enough materials that it is quite
obvious they were made at different times.  Aside from some dust from the
road, the air is crisp and clear, and the square itself seems well-traveled.

it, made from inconsistent enough materials that it is quite obvious they
were made at different times.  A wooden sign hangs over the door of the
building to the east, and a bushy doormat sits on the ground out front.  The
structure is two stories tall, and roofed in dull red tiles.

A Cobbled Square~
Unlike the dirt road to the north, this square is cobbled over with grey
stones with few gaps between them.  A wide, expansive area, the square
continues every way but back onto that dirt road.  Buildings surround the
cobbled ground, made from inconsistent enough materials that it is quite
obvious they were made at different times.  Aside from some dust from the
road, the air is crisp and clear, and the square itself seems well-traveled.

The Centre of A Cobbled Square~
A cobbled square stretches around you in all directions, surrounded by
buildings, with dirt roads branching off beyond.  The stones on the ground
are smooth with wear, but otherwise well-maintained with few gaps between
them.  An old stone well stands in the centre of the square, a wooden bucket
hanging from a windlass above.  A much newer-looking metal pump sits beside
the well.  A patch of grass surrounds the well, small flowerbeds on the
green, but enough out of the way to not interfere with access.  Several
stone benches sit around the well in this part of the square, allowing a
comfortable place to sit.

A Dirt Road~
A rutted dirt road extends northwards here, coming to a cobblestone
square to the south.  Buildings line the road, growing fewer the further
away from the village square they get.  Grass lines the road, patchily
tended, but adding a bit of colour to the otherwise drab surroundings.  In
the far distance to the north, you can see a stand of trees and some
buildings.  The air is clear and crisp, with little sign of dust from the

A rutted dirt road curves from the south to the west here, a thin, rutted
path branching northwards onto some farmland.  A small village begins to the
south, houses lining the road, and a market square can be seen in the
distance.  Scattered trees dot the landscape, thickening to the north past a
couple buildings.  The air is fresh and clear, the road not traveled enough
for there to be much dust.  The grass by the road grows higher the further
away from the buildings it gets.

A Grassy Yard~
This grassy yard is crisscrossed with the evidence of passage, dirt paths
created by wear rather than design.  Clover is mixed in with the grass,
causing little white flowers to dot the landscape.  One path meanders to the
east, looking to lead to the barn that stands directly northeast of you. 
The yard also continues northwards, a farmhouse in that direction,
surrounded by several tall trees.  The land is fenced in at the borders, but
it seems too low to restrict much in the way of livestock.

An Open Farmhouse~
This house is built low to the ground, with a gently sloped ceiling and
sturdy applewood rafters.  Even though the front door of the house is to the
south, the main sitting room is against the back wall, where a large window,
covered with a shimmering magical field, allows a pristine view of a large
apple orchard.  The kitchen is spacious, with a root cellar below, apple
preserves evident in both spaces in addition to more usual supplies.  The
house continues to the east, a number of bedrooms in that direction.

Grass covers the ground here, somewhat haphazardly tended but trimmed
relatively short.  Paths have been worn onto the ground from the path to the
west and the barn to the north.  The grass is also worn down leading to a
wooden cart and several bins.  A large wooden press for apples is out here,
too, with a canvas tarp left next to it.  A large tree grows near the barn,
tall and straight, with a wooden swing hanging from the branches.  The sweet

An Apple-Filled Barn~
Open to both the north and south, this barn serves as much a cover to the
dirt path that runs through it as anything else.  While there are stalls to
accomodate a cow and perhaps a team of oxen, the bulk of this barn seems
devoted to storing or processing apples.  A large press sits in one corner
near to several barrels, and elsewhere are baskets and bins for storage and
transport as well.  Another corner of the barn seems to have a small
carpentry shop as well, with a variety of lumber stacked in that area.

An Apple Orchard~
A large apple orchard sprawls out over the land here, trees growing
straight and tall.  They are laid out in neat rows, with paths worn into the
grass between.  A number of baskets have been left near to the barn door to
the south, and a ladder leans against the wall.  A white fence borders the
orchard, low to the ground.  At the far western side of the orchard, a
little stream meanders over the land, only a few feet wide and not even that
deep to look at it.  A worn path runs through the barn to the south.

to make for a small village can be seen.  Scattered trees dot the landscape,
with a large cluster to the northeast.  The air is fresh and clear, the road
not traveled enough for there to be much dust.  The grass by the road is a
foot or two high, shortening as it nears the farm to the northeast.  A small
building can be seen in the distance to the northwest.

buildings to make for a small village can be seen.  Scattered trees dot the
landscape, with a large cluster to the northeast.  The air is fresh and
clear, and low grass has started to overtake the edges of the road.  Past
it, the grass is a foot or two high, shortening as it nears the farm to the
northeast.  A small building can be seen in the distance to the north of

Outside A Wooden Hut~
A dirt road to the south fades to more of a grassy trail here, where it
passes by a small wooden hut.  It seems well-built, made with wooden boards
rather than split logs, and with no visible gaps in the structure.  The
grass outside is kept relatively short, and dotted over with a multitude of
coloured flowers.  The windows are oiled parchment, preventing a clear view
of the inside, but seem positioned to catch as much light as possible.  A
grassed-over path meanders northeast, in the general direction of the stand
of trees visible in the distance.

Near a Cluster of Beehives~
A number of wooden beehives are set about here in the tall grass, paths
worn down to each of them.  The edge of an apple orchard is a ways to the
east of you, and a slow, shallow stream wanders from it past the hives here.
The air has a sweet tang to its scent, and a breeze often stirs the grass
into waving lightly.  There seems little sign of traffic here, though a path
to a house in the south shows that there is at least some.  Despite the
height of the grass and lack of fencing, this area does look well and
regularly tended.

ovens allow product to cool, and others more to the front serve for display.
Sparklingly polished is a glass display case for more elaborate works. 
Beside it stands a counter, a stool behind it.  Against one wall is a wicker
basket, cushioned with brightly patterned fabric.  A set of shelves also
display an assortment of wax works, candles and delicately carved figurines.
The scent of fresh-baked bread fills the warm air, along with other rich,

An Inn\@s Common Room~
Several tables fill the common room of this inn, providing space for a
goodly number of patrons.  A large fireplace ensures the room is warm even
during the coldest of winters, and behind the bar, shelves lined with
bottles showcase an alternate means of warmth.  The walls have been neatly
papered over, showing an unobtusive pattern.  A kitchen looks to be in the
back, a swinging door offering some separation.  Lace wool curtains cover
the windows, which are paned with faintly visible magical fields.  A narrow

Blocks of soap sit ready for cutting, and finished product is set out on

instruments for the processing of fibre into usable goods.  The air has a
somewhat unpleasant tang to it, from the dyes and raw fibres both, and the
flowers that decorate the place are little use at masking it.  The door is
kept propped open most of the time, allowing a breeze through the shop.  The
village square can be seen through the door to the north.

road as well, offering a measure of shade for passers-by.  The road travels
from the square westwards, several houses surrounding it there.  Little dust
rises from the road here, leaving the air clean and crisp.
