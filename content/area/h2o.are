chayrin dark seething mass tentacles~
the Chayrin~
The dark seething mass of the Chayrin oozes along the floor.
~
The dark seething mass of the Chayrin oozes along the cave floor, in its
insatiable search for sustenance.  The dark mass is made up of irregular
looking lumps and protrusions, all covered by the midnight black ooze of its
body.  It gives off a dark miasma of rot and decay.  The Chayrin is spread
across a wide expanse of the cave floor, though the actual length changes as
the lumps of its body mutate in size and appearance.  Its height is also
impossible to gauge perfectly due to its ever-shifting nature.  Over a dozen
tentacles extend from its body at various locations.  The tentacles vary in
size even as you watch, as the Chayrin redistributes its mass at its whim.

Ostinel~
A wounded water templar leans against the back of the alcove.
~
A wounded water templar rests here against the wall of the alcove.  You
see several massive wounds and bruises, many of which have broken through
the armor he wears.  His head bleeds from a large cut so deep that you can
see the white bone of his skull.  Another massive slash across his chest
which reveals his ribs show how close to death he is.  His blue eyes are
glassy and unfocused as he rests in a crimson pool of his own blood.

The eldest turtle rests here within her large nest.

The eldest turtle is by far the largest of her kind.  At least six
centuries old, this tortoise has lived beneath the waves all of her life. 
She looks to weigh over eight hundred pounds.  Her shell shows the marks of
a lifetime of fighting for her survival.  Her brown leathery skin is
wrinkled with the toil of age.  Due to her seniority she has chosen this
choice spot as her nest, far away from the other turtles.

a sharpnosed puffer~
A sharpnosed puffer swims contentedly along the seafloor.
~
The sharpnosed puffer\@s scales have a beautiful blend of colors ranging
from orange, yellow, to blue.  A large black spot on its back fin resembles
an eye and helps draws predators attention from its head to its tail.  The
sharpnosed puffer occasionally fills its body with water in order to appear
larger and more formidable.

angelfish gray~
a gray angelfish~
A gray angelfish fish searches for algae to feed on.
~
The gray angelfish is small, but well rounded.  It has a short dorsal fin
and a stout black tail.  It is appropriately named due to its overall gray
appearance, except for the two faint vertical yellow stripes that run across
it.  The gray angelfish does not appear to be a fast specimen, but is quite
content on feeding on even slower foe: the algae that is ever-present.

The Office of Benedir~
Nestled deep within the Lidraeu Sea is the office of Benedir Arcel. 
There are no walls to the office, instead each of the four corners is marked
by a white marble Corinthian column.  Between each of the columns is empty
space, allowing for a perfect unimpeded view of the sea outside.  The
columns themselves bear fine blue runes that pulse with a gentle beat,
keeping the water at bay, and shielding this office from sight.  The middle
of the office is dominated by a large mahogany U-shaped desk which holds a
variety of paperwork and other essentials.  A plush leather chair sits
behind the desk.  The light for the office is provided by a shimmering white
mage-globe that levitates above the desk.  A soothing array of music is
softly played within the office, giving it an overall relaxing atmosphere.

In the Sea of Lidraeu~
Beneath the powerful waves of the Lidraeu Sea, the currents and eddies
still manifest themselves in their gentle pushing and pulling.  The light
from above is slanted and spread here beneath the waves, causing a myriad of
different sea creatures to be illuminated.  The grey waters of the Lidraeu
now take a slightly greenish tint from the contents of the sea that swirl
about you.  Small fishes swim in groups, and singularly, in the quest for
food and survival.  Clumps of seaweed reach eagerly from the sandy bottom to
the light that shines from above.  All about you the scene continues, except
to the south where the seafloor drops to a lower depth.

A Secluded Region~
Here between a small group of underwater hills and the approaching shore
line there is a quieter region of water.  The grey waters of the Lidraeu now
take a slightly greenish tint from the contents of the sea that swirl about
you.  The still water gently supports your weight as you look about and
notice the plant life that have taken advantage of the hills to root
themselves there.  Occasionally small fishes will nibble briefly upon the
plants and then swim adeptly away in their pursuit of food.  To the east and
west navigation is possible, while to the north the shoreline makes further
swimming unfeasible.

Deep Within the Sea~
Here, within the depths of the Sea of Lidraeu, the surroundings appear
darker due to the decrease of available light from the surface.  The mix of
sand and rock that composes the seafloor is hard to pick out because of the
stubborn plant life that still clings to these depths.  Small pieces of
debris float past you, seeking their final resting place.  Intermittently
different species of marine life swim by you, purposefully negotiating their

A Small Niche~
The coral reef here curves to the west, causing a small niche.  Due to
the density of the polyps here, the niche is the farthest west you can
navigate.  The polyps here grow in a multitude of different colors, from
brilliant shades of red to deep shades of blue.  Various other plant life
also grow here, including a variety of seaweed.  The water here is a bit
colder, indicating that you are farther away from the volcanic vents that
were heating the water to the east.  The only exit from this niche is to
east, where a large intersection of coral reefs are present.

light.  To the south further travel into the coral reefs are possible, and
to the north there is the intersection a large passageway through the coral.
Even above your head stretches an arched reef that had anchored itself to
the curved reefs to the east and west.  This arched reef begrudgingly allows
a few slivers of light from the surface through, making the dominant light
here the dull red glow of the volcanic vents.  Small, nimble, fish dart in

A Dead End~
The coral reefs come to an abrupt dead-end here.  The polyps here grow so
close that they form an almost seamless wall.  Even the smallest tilefish
appears to have trouble squeezing through the coral.  A volcanic vent is
present on the seafloor here, providing the necessary heat and nutrients to
this coral reef.  The curved formation of the coral reef blocks off further
travel in any direction, but to the east.  Dotted amongst the reef are
various sized oysters which have chosen this spot for their home.  The
oysters range from small ones that are barely two inches in diameter, to one
large one that is roughly two feet in length.  There are a few open oyster
shells scattered about on the sandy seafloor, indicating that other
creatures have found the oysters an appetizing meal.

Within the Coral Reefs~
The coral reefs open up here into a flat expanse of seafloor, giving the
creatures that live here slightly more room for larger creatures to make
their homes.  This open expanse is still boxed in around its perimeter by

creatures.  On the seafloor you can occasionally see small hills of sand
that have been shaped to form suitable nests.  Seaweeds and vegetation also
grow peacefully here.  This open area continues to the west and south, while
to the north lies a large intersection of coral reefs.

An Intersection of Coral~
Before you stretches a vast system of coral reefs that have rooted
themselves at the bottom of the sea.  The millions of multicolored polyps
which form these reefs are shown by both the diminished light from the
surface, as well as the dull red glow from the volcanic vents of the
seafloor.  Many of the coral reefs form around these small volcanic vents,
depending upon them for warmth and nutrients.  The passageways that have
been formed over the years into the coral reefs are, however, often random
and chaotic.  Jagged pieces of coral sometimes protrude out of the reefs,
causing a danger to anyone not nimble enough to avoid them as they swim
past.  This current passageway stretches to the north and south, with a
section of coral reef curved outwards to the east.

An Impasse of Coral~
Here the coral reefs come to an impasse.  There appears to be no
immediate opening large enough for someone of your size to go through, and
the curved structure of this reef is too dense for further navigation.  You
see a large number of starfish have attached themselves to this reef,
complacent in their role in this tight knit ecosystem.  Their sizes range
from miniscule, to a select few that are over a foot long in length.  A
number of them appear injured, with wounded or missing appendages.  The
almost magical ability of these starfish, however, seem to be regenerating
even the missing body parts with amazing alacrity.  The only possible route
out of this curved reef is to retrace your way back west, to the large
intersection of coral reefs.

The Edge of the Whirlpool~
Here is the rim of a valley within the sea, dominated by the funnel of
the large whirlpool.  The outer edge of the whirlpool churns the water at a
high speed.  It incessantly drags the debris and other pieces of flotsam
present into its center.  Sometimes a few unwary creatures are also caught
in this maelstrom and are mercilessly sucked into the bottom.  The whirlpool
rises high above you, growing even larger in diameter as it comes closer to
the surface of the sea above.  You notice that the pull of the whirlpool is
to the south, where its center is.  The bottom of the whirlpool is
impossible to detect, due to the depth of the valley.  To all appearances
the whirlpool is dragging its victims to an unknown abyss.  To the east the

current.  The coral reef has come to a complete end here, no longer able to
sustain itself in such an environment.  You see to the west the cause of all
this, the underwater cone of a large whirlpool.  The bottom of the
whirlpool, however, appears to reach far deeper than the current level of
the seafloor you are on.  The seafloor is also slightly sloped downwards to
the west, giving the whole region a bowl-like appearance.  The water here is

dark, due to the depth, though you can still see signs of life as fish and
other creatures of the sea swim about.  A few other species have taken
advantage of the lack of coral to root themselves in the sandy seafloor
here.  Quite a few of these plants have been nibbled upon as a food source.

The Nest of the Eldest Turtle~
Placed between two small rocky hills lies a large nest.  The nest is over
twelve feet in diameter and easily rises four feet above the seafloor.  It
is made from mainly scattered pieces of dead coral that have been stacked
together.  Occasionally a few pieces of skeletons of various sea creatures
were also used to make the nest.  The water here is peaceful, with only a
few small fish swimming about.  The two hills provide the perfect shelter
for this nest, protecting it even from the faint current pulling to the
west.  Littered on the sand before the nest are over a dozen different sized
tortoise shells.  Most of these shells are chipped and broken from age, and
the years they have been neglected on the seafloor.  The only exit lies back
to the quiet water to the west.

trench runs roughly in a crescent shape.  The top of the trench is covered
in coral, though at this spot you see a large opening within the coral.  The
opening appears to have been made by brute force and fury.  The edges of the
opening have signs of being bitten off by sharp teeth.  Inside the opening
is dark, with only the dull red glow of an volcanic vents giving off light. 
You can see a few dark shapes moving about slowly at the bottom of the
trench.  The coral that is on each side of the trench also provide anchorage
for the rest of the coral that is growing above it.  Small fish still use
these reefs as a home, darting in and out of the coral with nimble
dexterity.  To the north, south, and east the trench continues, while
beneath through the opening is the bottom of the trench.

Above the Lidraeun Trench~
You continue above the shallow trench that proceeds along the seafloor
here.  The half mile long trench runs roughly in a crescent shape.  The top
of the trench is covered entirely by coral, making it impossible to actually
reach its bottom.  The multicolored coral is so dense that the newer coral
is built upon the older ones.  The coral that is on each side of the trench
also provide anchorage for the rest of the coral that is growing above it.

The Center of the Whirlpool~
The raging waters of the whirlpool form the center of the whirlpool here.
High above you the cone of the whirlpool broadens to reach the surface,
while the bottom of the cone is anchored far below at the bottom of this
valley.  A jumble of other items and creatures swirl about you as they
quickly are forced deeper into the bottom of the whirlpool.  To the north
and west the whirlpool continues, albeit at a lesser fury at its rim.

The Outer Rim of the Whirlpool~
To the east the force of the whirlpool diminishes as you see sand and
even some coral farther east.  It incessantly drags the debris and other
pieces of flotsam present into its center.  Sometimes even a few unwary
creatures are also caught in this maelstrom and are unmercifully sucked into
the bottom.  The whirlpool rises high above you, growing even larger in
diameter as it comes closer to the surface of the sea above.  You notice
that the pull of the whirlpool is to the north, where its center is.  The
bottom of the whirlpool is impossible to detect, due to the depth of the
valley.  To all appearances the whirlpool is dragging its victims to an
unknown abyss.  To the west you see a mountain that stands firm from the
seafloor as it reaches towards the surface, unmoved by the fury of the
whirlpool.  You can hazily make out what looks to be a crevice, slightly
above you, within the center of the mountain.  The currents of the whirlpool
naturally seeks to bring you closer to the mountain as it pulls you nearer
to its center.

The Lair of Chayrin~
Within the crevice of the mountain, there is enough air to breathe.  This
natural cave that you find yourself in is slanted slightly upwards.  The
water that occasionally seeps through the crevice from the sea outside is
pooled on the floor, reaching about two feet in height.  The cave ceiling
here is about ten feet in height, higher to the west.  The rough and jagged
rocks of the caves appear to be made out of sandstone and limestone. 
Submerged under the water of the floor are hundreds of different pieces of
bone and other debris.  You see bones from all sorts of fish, broken shells
of turtles, and even a few suspiciously humanoid skeletons.  Scattered
amongst these bones are a jumble of other junk, including broken pieces of
metal from weapons and armor, and broken pieces of furniture and ships.  A
horrible miasma of rot and decay pervades the cave.  The cave continues to
the west, while the crevice leads you back down to the water outside.

The Lair of Chayrin~
Within this cave within the mountain, there is enough air to breath. 
This natural cave that you find yourself in is slanted slightly upwards. 
The water that occasionally seeps through the crevice from the sea outside
is pooled on the floor, reaching about a foot in height.  The cave ceiling
here is about fifteen feet in height, with what looks to be an alcove above.
The rough and jagged rocks of the caves appear to be made out of sandstone
and limestone.  Submerged under the water of the floor are hundreds of
different pieces of bone and other debris.  You see skeleton bones from all
sorts of fish, broken shells of tortoises, and even a few suspiciously
humanoid skeletons.  Scattered amongst these bones are a collection of other
items.  Most prevalent amongst these are the is the treasure that have been
sorted into a pile here.  A horrible miasma of rot and decay pervades the
cave.  The cave ends here, with the entrance to the cave to the east, and a
few natural jutting rocks that enable you to climb to the alcove above.  You
notice quite a lot of blood that is stained upon these rocks.

A Sheltered Alcove~
This is a small sheltered alcove that is roughly twelve feet from the
cave floor.  The alcove is only three feet in height, making it a tight
squeeze for most humanoids.  It stretches at least ten feet deep.  The rough
and jagged rocks of the caves appear to be made out of sandstone and
limestone.  At the entrance to this alcove there is a small barricade of
bones and debris that have been crafted into a flimsy wall.  The rest of the
floor is empty of further such refuse.  All on the floor of the cave,
however, are pools of blood that are soaking into the stone floor.  Behind a
few medium sized rocks you see a glint of metal.  At the back of the alcove
a small trickle of water runs out of a crack in the ceiling, collecting into
a small pool.  A horrible miasma of rot and decay pervades the alcove. 
Below you the cave proper continues.

In the Lidraeun Trench~
At the bottom of the shallow trench you see a distinct lack of the coral
that covers the top of the trench above.  A few pieces of coral grow
sporadically upon the seafloor, though most have been mauled and destroyed,
leaving only a few large teeth marks on the remains.  A volcanic vent is
here, providing warmth to the water and nutrients to the coral above.  The
dull red glow from the vent barely illuminates the bottom of the trench. 
Throughout the trench however, you see quite a few dark shapes swimming
slowly about in no planned pattern.  The water here is quiet and still, with
no other obvious signs of life.  You can exit the trench by going through
the opening above, or continue to the north, south, and east along the
bottom of the trench.
