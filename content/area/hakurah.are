caladaran monk hakuran~
a caladaran monk~
A caladaran monk peruses a tome in silence.
~
A wispy caladaran monk reads one of the Hakuran Order\@s tomes quietly in
the library.  She is younger than most of her brethren, her head shaved in
the monastic style.  She seems utterly immersed in the text, peaceful but
oblivious to the functions of temple above.

Tiqana~
A pleasant ethron monk directs the other cooks.
~
Tiqana is the head cook of the Hakurah temple, with authority to oversee
other monks in food preparation.  A Brintoran ethron, her skin is a stony
grey-green, and her short hair is a mess of mossy curls.  Born and raised in
the confines of the monastery, her talent for cooking became apparent as a
teenager.  By her twenties, she undertook a pilgrimage throughout Avendar,
visiting kitchens as far away as Jh\@ten.  Upon her return, Master Iskasal
asked her to take over directing the local menu and supervising the larder. 
She happily accepted, and spends her off-hours devising new recipes.

An aelin monk is here, training in the art of the shadow fist.
~
An aelin monk with ruddy feathers repeats the mental and physical drills
inherent to the assassin\@s creed.  His hair is unusually short for his kind,
but still long enough to sway visibly when he performs a forceful punch. 
Sweat beads on his brow, dripping from his jaw when he strikes.

Iskasal tall lanky caladaran psionicist hguildmaster hguild~
Iskasal~
Iskasal sits on a small purple cushion, practicing calligraphy at a low table.
~
A tall, lanky caladaran, Iskasal acts as both the head of the Hakurah
temple and head instructor of its psionicists.  It is said that he was the
first to discover the recipe for the temple\@s famed liqueur and personally
oversaw the construction of the distillery.  His actual age is a mystery
even amongst the Hakuran order; some suspect that his thorough mastery of
mind and body have given him unusual longevity even for his kind.  He is
distant but kind, training all who seek to unlock their own latent
potential.

A faithful healer and devoted of Jalassa, Drajasi arrived at the

browns, which goes well the darkish tone to her barky skin.  She has a
profound appreciation for the meditative arts of the mind, but felt called
to study the magics of Water.  She has served the temple for much of her
adulthood, offering healing and kindness to visitors and residents alike. 
Every morning, she watches the sunrise through the shrine\@s great crystal
window and performs the traditional ritual offering.

A youthful caladaran monk tends the counter.

Ialjimar is a well-regarded disciple of the Hakuran order.  A relatively
youthful caladaran, his barky body shows the rigor of monastery life but not
the encroachment of years.  His demeanor is pleasant, moreso than one might
expect of a monk, and he handles the sale of the Hakurah temple\@s famous
alcohol.  It is well known that he was hand-picked by Iskasal for the honor
of dispensing the shrine\@s spirits, which makes his position all the more
enviable.  He keeps watch over the shop for most of the day, meditating when
there are no customers.

Once a backstabbing merchant of the Shutharka clan, he abandoned that

One of the vows that allows him to stay within the monastery was that he
would give up merchantry forever.  Despite a harder life, his body still

An ethron distiller works to produce Hakuran liqueur.
~
A stout ethron monk works as the monastery\@s distiller.  He maintains the
apparatus that produces the Hakuran order\@s famous liqueur.  His dull green
cheeks are particularly rosy, suggesting that he may enjoy his role for more
than its philosophical implications.  He putters steadily along, ensuring
the distillery produces ample product.

Ral Kordarran~
A large, dark-furred kankoran sits cross-legged as he meditates.
~
A wanderer from the far-flung Crimson Sands, Ral Kordarran is an oddity
within the Hakurah Monastery.  Although kankoran, he shares little with the
Girikhan pack of the Ryarl.  His long years of travel made him a formidable
combatant, but he did not unlock his deeper potential in the ways of
assassinry until his arrival at the shrine.  Since then, he has been
accepted by the monks of the monastery, and he now serves as head of its

Alian Ashana blonde aelin man dark wings swordmaster~
Alian~
A blonde aelin man with dark wings meditates within the temple.
~
A tall and broad-shouldered aelin, Alian of house Ashana meditates within
the Hakurah shrine.  He is of middling age, his features carrying with them
the distinguished bearing of experience.  His hair is a mess of silver and
blonde strands, which sharply contrast his black-feathered wings.  Having
trained within the Thrantian School of Earendam, he is both educated and a
skilled swordsman.  He has made the long journey across the Brintors in
search of enlightenment, which he feels will take his bladesmanship to a new
degree of mastery.  His dark eyes smolder with intensity as he looks up
toward the crystal window, chin raised.

A salvemaker works in the laboratory preparing balms.
~
An heavyset human monk works in the laboratory, preparing the order\@s
saleable balms and salves.  He works with the careful deliberacy of the
Hakuran order, moving slow enough to ensure perfection in all he produces. 
He eyes the many jars, supplies, and stoves as he works, moving often.  His
robe has some spots on it from working with oil, and his forearms show many
pockmarks of tiny liquid burns.

Ellirae~
An attractive aelin monk watches the counter with a smile.
~
Ellirae is an attractive aelin monk who tends the oil counter at the
Hakurah temple.  Well into adulthood, she has all of the grace one would
expect of her people, as well as a decidedly pleasant demeanor.  Her hair is
short and blonde, complementing her light brown feathers.  She was taken on
as a student by Ral Kordarran in her youth, and has since proven herself a
capable acrobat and fighter.  Her looks and demeanor have made her popular
within the order, although she enjoys seeing new faces from abroad even
more.  A daughter of house Eshtrelle, she often looks for news of her home
city, Earendam.

Millard white furred white-furred bull bjorcha~
Millard~
A white-furred bull bjorcha, laden with heavy packs, sniffs at passersby.
~
Millard is a huge, rugged creature built for long travel and harsh
weather.  He is common among bull bjorcha with his curved horns and thick
white fur; as well, he is laden with harnesses and packs for his companion,
Karsi Elann.  He lets out an occasional snort and clops a heavy hoof onto
the ground beneath him.  When he notices other travelers, he often sniffs at
their pockets or lifts his nose for a pet.

Jacharan~
A tall, dark brown caladaran scholar is here.
~
Jacharan is a tall, dark brown caladaran, clad in a black robe.  His skin
is particularly rough, and the skin beneath his eyes sags deeply due to
advanced age.  Despite his ancient appearance, his posture is quite good,
giving him an oddly regal bearing.  He was once a famous traveling sage,
noted for his knowledge of Avendar\@s history in many geographic locations. 
Legends say that as an elder, he earned the favor of Chadraln the Seer, and
was given a breath of new vigor.  His name has faded from the pages of the
history which has so defined him, but his research continues, as timeless as
the multiverse he studies.

these are considered a travel necessity for merchants heading from the
stable temperatures of the underground out into the world with all its
capricious weather patterns.  These particular slippers bear the signs of
somewhat more expensive make; the leather soles are unmistakably
finely-tanned ch\@taren hide.

This robe is clearly the product of the Hakuran Order, and likely made at
their monastery north of Krilin Fortress.  The cloth itself, loose but
uncomfortable, speaks to their ascetic ideal; the black dye and grey
threading is to emulate the garb of their Order\@s first generation. 
Sanctioned by the goddess Jalassa, tiny aelin and caladaran symbols worked
into the stitching enhance its wearer.

The tasseling and cut of these leggings are common only to the far south,
from the pack which roams the Crimson Sands.  The dyeing and patterning are
in veneration of Arikanja Blackfang, the deific guardian of the desert
kankoran.  Stories suggest that such an article could only belong to one
accepted by the harsh desert itself.

a pair of gloves set with crystal~
A pair of white leather gloves bearing two prominent crystals is here.~
These gloves were crafted by Master Iskasal of the Hakurah Monastery. 
The story within the order is that he developed them to demonstrate to the
young members of the tradition that all things were possible with the
blessing of Jalassa.  It is said that to create them, he needed greater
insight than he possessed, and during his meditation, had the revelation
that liqueur was the key.  After the construction of the distillery and his
first taste of the famous temple brew, they say that he gained the
inspiration he initially sought.

A thin shortsword is here, its dark blade glittering like the stars.~
The shortsword Starlight is assuredly the mate of the rapier Moonlight,
meant for the off-hand of the rapier\@s wielder.  It is designed along an old
Harrudim style, which often used fanciful names for paired duelling weapons.
The silvery glint to the blade suggests the name is more than just a fancy,
however; you recognize the metal as being of a rare sort which reacts to the
light of stars.  You are unsure how the blade ended up with the Ashana
family, though their rumoured connections are extensive enough that a
curiosity like this sword would be well within their reach.

This sword appears to be of Harrudim make; the hidden image within the

Both the name of the sword and the red shimmer of the blade suggest an
invocation of Rhos.  That, and simply that it is a weapon lead you to
suspect it consecrated to the goddess Lilune.  How such a weapon came into
the hands of the Ashana family of Earendam is a mystery, though their

sigil diamond scale~
This sigil is a stylized depiction of a scale, its form cut from polished
diamond.  Unlike mundane gemwork, the sigil appears to have an impossible
flexibility, conforming to the bearer\@s movement.  As well, the same curious
trait suggests the possibility of the scale\@s own movement.  The facets of
the diamond are illuminated from within by holy light.

Hakurah and the Seven

                    The Founding of the Hakurah Temple


                          By Jacharan Chadeska





~
E
bound2~
Hakurah, like many of the caladaran who had migrated from the Ilnjalmir,
settled in the Republic.  While they accepted him, as they did his caladaran
forebears, he found no peace with them; the bustle of the city and the
inanities of its troubles frayed his nerves.  He traveled from settlement to
human settlement in search of solace, but it was fleeting.  Yearning for
home, he took up with others of his kind to make the dangerous journey east.
They scarcely reached the border of the Rirro Jagka before their group was
attacked.  Hakurah and the other seven survivors retreated back to the west,
unwilling to return to Republican life, and unable to reach their home.  

It was then that Hakurah posed a new journey, not to the east, but to the
far north.  There, he reasoned, they could escape the fervor of foreign
cities, and create a new ascetic paradise.  The seven agreed; the Brintor
mountains would be a test of only their collective will, and its rules were
far more predictable than marauding beasts.  Hakurah beseeched Jalassa for
wisdom, and despite the warmth of the late summer, snow fell upon the
ramshackle caladaran camp.  There could be no doubt that this event was a
sign of the Arbiter\@s favor, and they set out for the mountains the next
day.  
~
E
bound3~
The journey was slow but pleasant, and the summer gave way to fall.  They
followed the Dantaron river until it met the vast Arien Plains, and turned
north, cutting a path through the thick forest at the foot of the Brintor
range.  They feasted upon the bounty of the forest when their supplies began
to wear thin.  By the time they reached the first footpath into the
mountains, their spirits were high; the light of the sun and moons filtered
through the canopy, giving ample time for meditation and discussion.  Truly,
peace had found them more quickly than they thought possible.  

Crossing the mountains proved difficult.  Wild men hunted those ranges, and
the beasts grew ever more dangerous.  Their supplies dwindled further, and
attacks became frighteningly common.  Although Hakurah had never eaten meat
during his lifetime in the east, it grew familiar during the journey.  Boars
provided necessary skins, bones, and sustenance for he and the seven,
sheltering them from hunger and mountain wind.  Their collective peace
wavered, as many began to fear that this place was as dangerous as the Rirro
Jagka itself.  Yet, having traveled so far, Hakurah urged them onward, and
they followed.  
~
E
bound4~
At last, they reached a mountain pass which opened up into the snowy
plains of the Ryarl.  While Hakurah and the seven had experienced snowfall,
they had never known a land so chill as this.  Still, the icy white seemed,
too, a sign; Hakurah posited that this place must be blessed by Jalassa
Herself.  They shallowly explored the plains before they were confronted by
its residents: the kankoran.  Feral and deadly, these wolfen creatures did
not appreciate caladaran encroachment on their hunting grounds.  Fear became
terror amongst the group, as there was no retreat for them across the
mountains.  They fled west, just as before.  

Fall had given way to winter, and the mountain snow and wind took on
proportions Hakurah and the seven had never known.  The pass they followed
to reach the white plains was closed to them, and kankoran hunters lived to
the east.  They huddled into a small valley, sheltered from the worst of the
elements.  With little food, the ascetics had to rely on something more
esoteric for survival-- will.  First, they rationed their food, and gathered
broken stones to block the entrance to the ravine.  When their food was
spent, they went without, their thin, starving bodies clad in ragged furs. 
Meager fires and makeshift shelters provided their only refuge.  
~
E
bound5~
Winter intensified, and Hakurah knew that there would be no survival
without permanent shelter.  With the entrance to the valley effectively
closed, they turned their attention to construction.  Starvation, however,
had yielded to them; Hakurah and the seven shared the revelation of psionic
sustenance, suspending their desire for food.  In honor of this new insight,
their home would be a temple to the Arbiter.  They traveled higher into the
rocky terrain, bringing ever larger stones from its snowy heights.  The
thick walls of the temple rose through the worst of the winter, and the
ascetics persevered.  

With winter beginning to wane, the temple neared completion; Hakurah and the
seven began to build its great, crude dome when trouble once again found
them.  Months of starvation finally claimed the lives of two of the
disciples, and heavy snow threatened those who remained.  Their refuge had
become a prison, with cold and exposure their constant companions.  With
less hands, construction halted, and the five who remained scoured the rock
and snow for any food they could find.  Hakurah sat within the unfinished
temple, and prayed to Jalassa for aid.  Will alone, it seemed, had failed
them.  
~
E
bound6~
Miraculously, the Arbiter intervened.  By Her divine decree, an enormous
crystal window completed the dome, and even its crude stones bound
themselves together.  Light shined through it, illuminating and warming the
dark temple.  Starved and weary, Hakurah collapsed.  When he awoke in the
hour before dawn, the five had returned with a miracle of their own-- a
freshly slain wild boar.  They fashioned a simple altar beneath the great
crystal, and placed the sacrifice upon it.  When the sun rose, its light
focused upon the altar, searing the meat.  For the first time in many
months, the ascetics\@ hunger was truly sated.  

With the coming of spring, Hakurah and the five were again free to leave the
valley.  However, having survived that first, terrible winter, they knew
this place to be a holy site; truly favored by the Arbiter Herself.  They
began to cultivate the earth and store food, as well as carve into the
mountains themselves.  The new monastic order took their namesake from
Hakurah, as it was he who initiated the journey and felt the favor of
Jalassa.  They settled in the shadow of the temple, and created the home
they dreamt of under the great lens that She had willed to be.

A History of Settlement and Trade in the Northern Regions of Avendar

Where ideologues throughout the north often paint the situation there
strictly as one of human imperialism versus kankoran savagery, taking an
economic lens to the region offers a more nuanced perspective.  

The rallying cry of the cult of Girikha has often been one of a land
continually encroached upon from all sides.  As the eastern pass is more
relevant to archeological interests than modern history, I intend to confine
this treatise\@s scope solely to the west.  
~
E
worn3~
In the wake of the Second Kankoran War, public opinion in Earendam
clamoured for a more permanent solution to the kankoran menace.  With Lord
Valectis\@ assassination still in living memory, the Patrician of the era,
Lord Darishal, was keenly aware that his position was far more precarious
than the laws of the time would suggest.  Unfortunately, a deterrent show of
force against the red-furred Khanvali kankoran of the Rirro Jagka to the
east was liable to have disasterous consequences, particularly with the army
still in a state of recovery.  

Chronicles of the era credit his wife, the Lady Malanya with the idea to
propose an economic alliance to the Var Bandorian Merchants\@ Council. 
Together they would fund a joint venture into the Brintors in search of
mineral resources, as well as the founding of a military outpost to stand as
vanguard against incursions from the north.  While the kankoran of the Ryarl
had no history of such behaviours, the public of Earendam at the time only
cared insofar as that they had fur.  

The Bandorian stone-seer Kanseilla is credited with the discovery of rich
iron veins in the lower Brintors*.  At much the same time, in Earendam, the
scholars of the Tower of Golden Flame announced their own discoveries which
would vastly expedite the production of steel.  With the promise of
better-equipped armies salving the people of Earendam\@s fears, the mining
expedition was redoubled and the matter of the outpost was largely viewed as
an assignment where the politically inconvenient would be dumped.  

* Aziakc, K. \#How to Make Gold from Iron\# Var Bandor, 17-20

In fact, with the earth guilds\@ attention on the mines themselves,
construction of the outpost would need to be done by hand.  A fortifiable
valley was found near to the pass through to the Ryarl, and construction
began.  Resources available at the time mandated the bulk of the work be
done from wood, and earth magi with an emphasis on large-scale construction
have been in high demand in the region ever since.  

Not long after construction had begun, explorers reached out over the pass,
encountering a caladaran monastery in addition to the roaming packs of
kankoran who hunted the plains.  These first contacts were critical to the
survival of the still-unnamed outpost in its early years; resources came
from the south largely as afterthoughts, and starvation was a constant
threat in that era.  

In marked contrast to the southern kankoran, those of the north interacted
largely peacably with their new human neighbours.  In large part this can be
ascribed to the outpost having its hands full in its current location, with
no mind to expanding.  The brisk barter between peoples swiftly found the
humans fed and the kankoran hunting with iron and steel where once they had
used wood and bone.  The introduction of human-made armour vastly reduced
injury and casaulty rates amongst the kankoran, and water scholars being
only days away rather than weeks radically reduced the impact of disease on
the population.  

In fact, it was only a few short years before even the most radical Girikhan
cultist found himself using human-made weaponry on his hunts.  It was not
that much longer before there was a small but thriving kankoran minority
living in the outpost itself.  Many relished the opportunity to live a more
settled and stable lifestyle than the nomads of the Ryarl.

Life in the far northern Brintors was not to remain idyllic for so long. 
A small village of \#hill giants\# theorized to be distant relatives to the
chaja* soon came upon the fledgeling settlement and began to prey upon the
residents.  Relations between settlers and the nearby kankoran became
strained as a local community leader named Maiana Rotheld claimed the giant
attacks were a part of a kankoran plot.  

An opposing faction in the settlement led by Estia Krilin sought the aid of
a Jalassan negotiator from the nearby monastery, and together they did their
best to put these concerns to rest.  However, they were still faced with the
steady attacks coming out of the mountains.  

With the kankoran relations still too frayed to seek support from the Ryarl,
Krilin looked south.  Still working with her Jalassan aide, she concocted a
legal argument to call upon the original charter of the settlement.  Krilin
and a small retinue returned to Earendam to beseech the aging Lord Darishal
for assistance.

While the specifics of their negotiations are beyond the scope of this
document, chroniclers of the era ascribe their astonishing results to Lady
Krilin\@s distant kinship with the Lady Malanya.  Lady Krilin seeking the aid
and support of Iandiric relief organizations, including the Great House of
the Guardians should not be discounted when looking at her results, however.

Estia Krilin left Earendam bearing full recognition of the settlement as an
independent legal entity, full title to the iron mines which had predicated
the foundation of the fortress*, the loan of a small military contingent,
and an elevation to the hereditary title of Baroness for herself.  

Upon her return, the newly-minted Estia, Baroness Krilin swiftly named the
settlement after herself and set to fortifying it, as well as pacifying the
hill giant population.  

Relations with the kankoran never fully recovered, as Rotheld\@s accusations
were deemed evidence of human treachery, but as Krilin Fortress grew, they
continued to engage with those of the pack who tolerated them.  Both groups
became relatively wealthy via this and trade routes through Krilin to the
south.  Educational opportunities for young kankoran began to arise as well,
as the memories of the most recent Kankoran War began to fade and
Earendamian guilds took interest in them as exchange students.  

Limited trade with the reclusive ch\@taren of Avayn began once the settlement
was more fully-established, though the xenophobic folk of the haven rarely
let more than trinkets loose from their grips.  

* See \#Blood and Iron\# by I. Rijjani for a look at the skirmishes this 
  predicated.

In conclusion, despite a difficult start in the early years, the
relations between Krilin and the Ryarl have typically been of vast mutual
benefit, improving quality of life on both sides.  Philosphical differences
aside, leadership in both groups has largely been in favour of continued
amicable relations.  

Fringe groups on both sides push toward conflict, born out of a mutual
distrust.  In many ways, the very roots of the Fourth Kankoran War can be
found in Maiana Rotheld\@s accusations against the Girikhans of the Ryarl.  

As with all things, however, memories fade and trade continues, ensuring
mutual prosperity.

Excerpt from \#The Way of Discipline: A History of Psionics\#, by Disimi
the Wise

Psionic manifestation, historically, has been exceedingly rare outside of
the caladaran race.  No true systematic study of such abilities existed
within the Earendam river basin until the coming of the caladaran and their
stories of Jalassa, Arbiter of Enlightenment.  The first to truly guide
other races to the study was a leading caladaran ascetic named Adrajisk.  

A monk of the Jalassan order, he became keenly interested in the
possibilities of interracial dialog.  His curiosity was drawn to the ways of
swordmastery, as its method was predicated on different, but effective,
mental techniques.  The aelin ak\@anginta, which had in no way been
influenced by the Arbiter, offered a stunning possibility: that there may be
more roads to enlightenment than he had previously known.  

Adrajisk began an exhaustive study of discipline throughout Avendar\@s known
races.  This included the human disciples of Dolgrael, who were
well-established throughout the Republic; the aelin students of the sword;
and the fledgling art of assassinry, which shared its own curious
philosophical edge.  In this process, he was introduced to other artistic
forms which lent themselves to discipline, such as topiary and calligraphy. 
He then began the immense task of synthesizing these possibilities into a
greater whole.  

In time, he would demonstrate the techniques he had developed to others. 
Having passed beyond the primitive psionics of his forebears, he was able to
control his body on an unprecedented level.  He could rapidly heal wounds,
shatter a block of stone with a single strike, levitate objects, or walk
through fire without feeling pain.  These dramatic demonstrations affirmed
not only the primacy of Jalassa\@s philosophy of discipline, but as well
revealed a depth of potential which rivaled the greatest mages.  He named
this new school of study \#ginta\@cham\@akan\#, \#thought creating form\#, and
gained his first disciples within the Republic.

Born in silence, to silence we return, 
We stand alone but feel each other\@s heart, 
Oh calm the soul that still knows how to yearn, 
  
We look to you and sing for pain that burns: 
No matter what we say, we are apart, 
Born in silence, to silence we return, 
  
A single star bright enough to discern, 
Tugs at the sorrows we beg for you to thwart, 
Oh calm the soul that still knows how to yearn, 
  
We sing a gift we beg you to not spurn, 
To you we give our breath: your highest art, 
Born in silence, to silence we return, 
  
No matter what we do our hearts yet churn, 
Would they could be severed, that traitor part, 
Oh calm the soul that still knows how to yearn, 
  
All that we cannot ever hope to learn, 
The mystery lies within us at the start, 
Born in silence, to silence we return, 
Oh calm the soul that still knows how to yearn.

The crimson eye upon the two, 
Hand to hand and cheek to cheek, 
The spiral woven of dance and night, 

Eye to eye and breath to breath, 
The lady draws closer still, 
A pause, a space, and parted lips, 
And she says-- 

This is a gift, I give to you, three things: 
A heart that is never true, 
An eye to see where all is blind, 
And the third is a thing that you must find, 

Eye to back and breath to air, 
She parts from him, he stands alone, 
The spiral broken, 
The night, and he, remain, 

--met twice, by the light of the moon, 
The silver eye upon the two, 
A hand that never touches, an eye that never meets, 
And he alone and she alone, close enough to meet, 

A sound, a break, the shattered glass, 
The lady shakes as she stands, 
A pause, a space, then flesh to flesh, 
And she says-- 

This is a gift, I give to you, three things: 
A heart that is always true, 
An eye to close where all is bright, 
And the third was made of that long-ago night, 

Hand to hand, and cheek to cheek, 
The lady draws close; clouds wink the moon, 
The spiral renews under a starless sky, 
The lady, and he, remain.

I retired, as all men do, finally acknowledging the role that had been
waiting for me since my first day on my own.  This, perhaps, was my most
important revelation-- that I had found the greatness Jalassa had intended
for me by finding peace.  The torrent of emotions which stormed through my
heart as I traveled quieted.  I no longer needed battle to reach the moment
of sublime oneness; in that sense, I had discovered my final truth.  The
sword itself had become unnecessary.  My wife and I spent our evenings with
our daughter, and in those moments, I embraced enlightenment.  

The final thoughts I will leave with you are these: the journey we take does
not lead us to Her, but rather, it is how we proceed upon that journey. 
Every moment of simple reflection, every diversion, and every aspect of fate
draw us closer to perfection if we let them.  Without this openness, we are
no better than automatons; instruments whose music is the rote repetition of
a beginner.  I encourage you, you who may tread the same dusty footpaths
that I once walked, to not lose sight of the greater whole.  In touch with
all things, you are your greatest self, and a legend in the ways that truly
matter.

I returned to the temple, now a grown man.  By then, I was more
experienced, more scarred, and somehow more open.  I gazed upon the great
crystal lens, and as the sun rose over the shrine, I was briefly blinded by
its intensity.  I sat upon the tiles, and drew a cigar from my pack.  As my
vision cleared and my mind settled, I had a new revelation.  My approach to
the sword had always been sensory; what was in my hand, what moves I made,
and what my eyes could read from my opponent.  In that moment of blackness,
for the first time, I truly -saw-.  There was no sword-- it existed only in
my mind.  

I took this lesson to my studies.  While my physical eyes remained open, my
mind\@s eye saw something more.  My characteristic flourishes and other
martial vanities melted away.  To see the perfect path that the edge should
follow made every form tighter; every reaction swifter; and every cut more
deadly.  The Arbiter had heard my wordless prayers, and so too did my vigor
grow.  I could perform longer, more easily, more effortlessly.  My fatigue
faded from my mind when I fought, much as it did with the finest Lithling
cigar.  I took to calligraphy in my time away, feeling the same perfection
in the stroke of the brush as the sword.  
~
E
red4~
It took many long hours and many scars before I came to hone such things
to their necessary perfection.  Every wound became motivation; every blow
struck became victory.  I drank more deeply of centering myself at the
beginning of a journey.  Without this calm, no effort bore fruit; without
opening myself to rhythm, there could be no dance.  One might ask if I took
to prayer-- I would of course say yes, but not in the manner that most would
expect.  One does not prostrate themselves before the Arbiter and hope for
succor-- instead he lets the song of his actions speak for him.  

In turn, I felt the rhythm flow through me more greatly.  With each small
act, I could feel Her guiding presence.  I had heard that She called for the
subjugation of passion, but I came to know differently.  It was not intended
in the sense that one kills their emotions and becomes less a man, but
rather, that passions found only their most useful place.  In each form, I
felt free; the struggles and frustrations and joys that I felt found
expression in the flash of blades, the turn of foot, and the stretch of
wing.  I, too, knew this to be Her gift for my dedication.

I graduated from the Thrantian School and began to travel the world as an
adventurer.  At first, I chafed at the distinction made between myself and
my brethren; it did not suit me to know my peers looked down upon me for not
accepting the place of power that was mine by heredity.  What they could not
understand is that I sought a different measure of power-- one which comes
from the whole acceptance of oneself, and project that ability into great
deeds.  The place that waited for me could wait until my passing breath, but
greatness was far more elusive.  Unfortunately, my aspirations and my actual
skill were quite different.  

I traveled to the Hakurah Monastery as a young adult, secure enough in my
skill to make the journey but still far shy of perfection.  It was here that
I saw the great crystal window that overlooked the altar of the ancient
monk.  Light filtered through its etching, casting colors across the
temple\@s interior.  I saw in it the first pattern, the snowflake, and knew
the first truth: that all great things are composed of many lesser ones.  I
once felt that lesser meant inferior; perhaps that was my natural
assumption.  Yet, it revealed to me that without solid fundamentals, my
dream could never be.

The way of the sword demands both perfection and inspiration,
transforming its devoted from warriors to artists.  However, the path to
such divine elegance is a treacherous one; for its apparent simplicity, it
requires sacrifice, diligence, and a proclivity for grace.  This is how I
came to know it-- born of noble blood, but with aflame with ambition.  For
one such as I, duty is nature, and the expectations of my circle made the
first steps obvious ones.  What I did not anticipate is that I would have an
ally on this personal journey, in the edict of the Arbiter.  

I did not begin my journey as a military man, but rather as a student of the
Thrantian School in Earendam.  Wealth or no, I dreamt of being more than a
fool who played at the sword-- I would attain the fleeting perfection of
craft that few ever know.  My early lessons were the same as any; how to
hold a blade, how to center my thoughts, and how to feel the subtle rhythm
of battle.  My teachers once likened it to music, to hearing the tick of the
beat slow and separate as I performed.  In those days, I tried to
internalize that pulse, so that it rang not in my ears, but in my heart.

At the Monastery Gatehouse~
Two heavy stone arches mark the inner and outer doors to the gatehouse,
both cut from the heavy wood of Karacha firs.  The stonework of the
gatehouse is comprised of large, rounded stones, and the flagstones that
start underfoot are smoothed with the feet of centuries.  The vaulted
ceiling bears a single, wrought iron mount and a globe of light.  The
pointed tips of a portcullis can be seen just inside both doors, jutting out
a few feet from the ceiling.  The stone path to the east leads to the trail
approaching the monastery.  To the west is the courtyard of the Hakurah
shrine.

The Courtyard~
A wide courtyard greets those who come to the Hakurah monastery, its
flagstones smoothed with the passage of many feet.  Despite the harsh
weather, the grounds are clean, free of debris that could be whipped up by
the northern wind.  Westward lies the renowned Hakurah temple, famed for its
ancient, manual construction and the spectacular crystal window set into the
eastern half of its dome.  South of the courtyard lies a flourishing
vegetable garden.  The gatehouse into the monastery lies to the east,

A wide courtyard greets those who come to the Hakurah monastery, its
flagstones smoothed with the passage of many feet.  Despite the harsh
weather, the grounds are clean, free of debris that could be whipped up by
the northern wind.  The entrance to the Hakurah temple opens to the west,
its ancient, hand-cut stones taken from the ravine itself.  The entryway
itself is modest in comparison to the thirty-foot peak of the crystal window
that surmounts the shrine.  South of the courtyard is a flourishing
vegetable garden.  To the north is a long, sloped building which follows the
ravine wall, while the gatehouse to the monastery awaits to the east.

A Vegetable Garden~
A flourishing vegetable garden reaches from the courtyard\@s edge to the
southern ravine wall.  The soil within has been imported on the backs of the
monastery\@s pilgrims, from richer lands to the south.  Thin rows of plants
are maintained by the Hakuran monks, sorted into various sections by stones
or wood.  A small stone shed has been built against the inside of the
monastery\@s protective wall, situated to the east.  A sloped building stands
to the south, where the monastery\@s balms are produced.  To the west, the
garden continues.  Beyond the garden to the northwest is the temple and its

This small storage shed has barely enough room for a gardener to move

for upcoming seasons to old tools and bags of additional topsoil.  Despite

A Sturdy Guardhouse~
The guardhouse is situated above the gate to the monastery and provides
shelter to the monks currently assigned to keeping watch.  Much like the
dormitory proper, the guardhouse contains simple bedrolls and blankets for
the five watchmen.  Because of the many doors and ensuing draft, extra furs
cover the floor and augment the otherwise spartan accommodations.  A winch
lies at the east and west end of the guardhouse, allowing those within it to
raise or lower either portcullis.  Doors to the north and south lead to the
battlements.  A trapdoor in the floor leads to the armory, while another
leads upward.

The Watchman\@s Post~
Essentially the roof of the guardhouse, this watchman\@s post is little
more than a square platform with low, thick stone walls.  From here, the
monks on guard duty have a commanding view of the Ryarl and any potential
threats.  A bronze bell sits within a sturdy bracket, serving as an alarm. 
The view from here of the Brintors is particularly breathtaking, as is the
chill snap of the northern air.  To the west, the great crystal window of
the monastery remains unobstructed by the tower\@s presence.  A trapdoor in
the floor leads to the guardhouse below.

The Hakuran Battlements~
The battlements run along the top of the mortared stone wall that
connects one side of the ravine to the other.  Strongly crenellated, the

A Small Distillery~
This room is quite expansive, the rough walls hinting at the hours of
backbreaking labor that must have carved it out of the living rock.  A line
of tables on the back wall hold large, dark glass carboys, and a wide vat is
on the wall near the western doorway.  A small nook holds herbs both in jars
and tied up for drying.  The bulk of the floorspace is devoted to large
racks holding barrels and bottles for aging and storage.  A small area in
the corner holds assorted tools for bottling, decanting, and testing the
fine liqueurs produced here.  The garden to the north can be seen through a
small window.  The distillery continues to the east and west.

itself, its great stone presence dominating the landscape.  To the north, a
long, sloped building follows the ravine wall east-to-west.  The path
continues to the west, and a door nearby leads to the dining house.  The

A wide path runs around the Hakurah temple, bearing flagstones similar to
those of the courtyard.  The path here is less traveled than before the
shrine proper, lined with low, scrubby bushes.  To the southeast is the
temple itself, its spectacular crystal window out of view from this angle. 
The long, sloped building which follows the north ravine wall vanishes as
the ravine wall encroaches on its southern side as well.  The path curves to
the south, bordering the heavy rock wall to the west.  A weatherproof oaken
door has been set into the stone, ensconced in a carved archway.  A door to
the north leads into the dining house.

The Kitchen House~
A stone-and-mortar affair, the kitchen house is kept warm by the
ever-present heat of its hearths.  Large iron cauldrons sit over each,
filled with porridges and stews.  When not in use, the cauldrons are moved
to stand on their side in the corner until they can be cleaned.  Wide
benches occupy the center and walls of the kitchen, covered with cooking
utensils, herbs, and foodstuffs.  A doorway leads northward to the larder. 
The dining house is behind a stout door to the west, and the shrine proper
waits through another door to the south.

hang scores of different herbs, dried and sorted, along with strings of
onions, garlic, and other roots.  Sacks, crates and wooden boxes of
foodstuffs all sit neatly organized, yet fill much of the room, leaving only
thin walkways through the larder.  A small supply of lamp oil is also stored
here, near the door.

to the south lends itself to a considerable draft and the bite of the
northern air.  To the south is the cobbled courtyard of the monastery.

manual labor, rather than magic.  The stone floor is covered by thin,
well-worn reed mats to stave off some of the ravine\@s chill.  The walls are
mostly unadorned except for wrought iron mountings bearing glowing orbs of
light.  A sturdy door is set in the east wall, while the interior opens

sports an impressively high ceiling.  Reed mats cover the uneven floor, new
enough to know they are replaced often.  Mounted globes of light illuminate
the chamber, four at the walls and one hovering near the room\@s apex.  Upon
the northern wall, a large, painted mural covers the bare greys its surface,
depicting the ancient history of Jalassa.  The chamber continues to the west

large painted mural northern wall history jalassa~
This great mural covers much of the wall, painted in a variety of vivid
browns, reds, greens, and whites.  It depicts the exodus of the ancient
caladaran from the Rirro Jagka and the many locales between their humble
glades and the far Brintors.  Stylistically, the artistry is not suggestive
of realism, but possesses a dream-like or memory-like quality to it. 
Glades, fields, jungles, swamps, mountains, are all accounted for, each
striking in its bold abstraction.  A haloed caladaran figure walks at the
fore, representative of the Arbiter Herself, while other more mundane
caladaran subjects follow behind.

A Humble Meditation Area~
A smaller chamber which adjoins the great hall provides an unusually cozy
space is reserved for meditation.  In the center is a low table, upon which
a decanter of heated alcohol is placed for the attending monks.  Surrounding
the table is a circle of dyed reed mats, which sit directly upon the stone
floor.  Perhaps from the heat of the drinks served, this room has noticeably
less of that ravine\@s chill clinging to it.  The walls here bear the simple
adornment of classical caladaran meditative symbols, each intended to give
focus to those who see it.  A door is set into the west wall, while the
stone interior continues to the east and south.

A Solitary Rock Garden~
The great rock of the ravine opens here, providing a view of the sky
above.  The bare rock floor has been covered thick by imported ivory sands. 
Placed here and there throughout this reasonably sized depression are larger
rocks, sand filling the space in between.  The natural walls of the ravine
remain intact, giving the enclosure a desolate feel, as it lacks water and
plant life.  The natural obstructions of the ravine keep the majority of the
elements out, with a barely perceptible field of magic blocking the rest.  A
set of rakes leans against the wall near the eastern doorway, which returns
to the stone interior.

mounted with wrought iron light-holders, illuminating the circle for
students to clearly see the matches.  The ambient temperature is slightly
warmer, and the air thick with the musty scent of exertion.  To the east

This alcove largely serves as a bridge to the meditation area to the west

the sign of the senses, which the assassins of old named \#chi\#.  The alcove
itself is empty to the naked eye aside from this symbol and a few wrought
iron supports the interior\@s dim light.  Shadows play upon the smooth, grey
walls and uneven floor, their patterns changing when wisps of smoke cross
the low, static lights.  To the south is the short hall which leads back to

A Dark Meditation Chamber~
The meditation chamber is entirely unlit, with a heavy bjorcha-wool
curtain separating it from the rest of the interior.  The air is thick in
the darkness, heady with the scents of smoke and incense from a roughly
central iron censer.  There is no furniture within the chamber, only a
circle of tough, woven mats set on the uneven floor.  The room is noticeably
warmer than other areas of the ravine interior, encouraging a relaxation
rare within the monastery.  Although all of the stone walls are covered by
thick curtains, the only apparent exits are to the east and west.

Part of the long, high hall on the north side of the ravine, the
dormitories provide the residents of the Hakurah shrine with a place to
rest.  The accommodations are spartan at best, with each acolyte having
little more than a bedroll and a blanket.  Because of the proximity of the
ravine walls to the dormitory, there are no windows.  Instead, the ceiling
provides natural light by way of skylights.  There are no artificial lights

This room is dedicated to the knife, with its eastern and western walls
dedicated to showing the incredible multiplicity of its styles.  The floor
is covered by a dyed bjorcha wool carpet, keeping at least some of the

This large room within the ravine wall is surrounded on three sides by
plant life.  Dim light appropriate to the growth of these plants radiates
from a wrought iron mounting at the ceiling\@s center.  The room itself is
warm and the air thick with humidity, much more akin to places far south of
the Ryarl.  Druidic signs line the various planters, providing unexpected
vivacity to the flora growing in this chamber.  A rough central table allows
a workspace for grinding and extracting fluid from the plants for refinement
into poison.  A field of magic preserves the climate of the room, and
prevents it from spreading through the curtain to the east.

The East Side of the Hakurah Temple~
The Hakurah temple is an expansive, perfectly circular hall which spreads
out from the arched eastern doors.  The walls are composed of smooth, grey
stone, hand-laid by the first ancient monks.  Carved octagonal panels
interlock in a repeating pattern, oiled and polished to give the walls a
rich wooden sheen.  A dark, unadorned carpet hugs the wall with a spur to
soften the way from the entryway to the altar to the west.  Between the
carpets, dark brown octagonal tiles provide a stable surface for
free-standing braziers.  Far above, the apex of the shrine\@s grey dome rises
about thirty feet.  A simple spiral staircase winds upward to a wooden
gantry along the dome\@s base.  The shrine continues to the west, while the

The Great Altar of Hakurah~
At the center of the shrine is a large altar, cut from the same grey
stone as the temple itself.  Most notably, it is imperfect enough to be
recognizably built by mortal hands, rather than magic or divinity.  Upon the
altar\@s surface are the embers of previous sacrifices and the darkening of
ages of devotion.  Legends say that the altar was built by Hakurah, one of
Jalassa\@s early chosen who led the ancient caladaran across the Brintor
Mountains.  The spectacular crystal window, etched with a breathtakingly
perfect snowflake, directs natural light onto the altar itself, both purely
and refracted.  A spur of carpet leads eastward, to the temple\@s arched
entryway, while the tiled expanse of the interior extends in all other

here, the tiny patterning of the floor\@s tiling is less apparent, but
instead, a greater, larger pattern is visible.  The lights and scents of the

shrine to their goddess, Jalassa, they were beset by hardships, harsh
winter, and other struggles.  With only part of the dome completed, Hakurah
beseeched the Arbiter for Her aid, and the miracle She provided was the
crystalline perfection of the shrine\@s famous window.  Its slightly curved
ovoid shape captures and focuses the morning sun, directing it onto the
altar at the shrine\@s center.

A worn stone stairwell descends from the Hakurah temple proper into a

shrine\@s exterior, and are wide enough for two monks to pass one another
comfortably.  The air is noticably colder once outside the direct view of
the great crystal window, carrying on it an earthen musk.  Small, enclosed
lamps rest on iron wall mounts, casting appreciable light and long, deep
shadows across the stone surfaces.  The light of the temple warms the upper
steps, while the small library of the Order waits to the south.

The Library of the Hakuran Order~
This small library is settled beneath the Hakurah Temple, carved out of
the rocky earth of the Brintors.  Shelves line the walls, containing a small
variety of scrolls, books, and tomes.  The floor is covered by a heavy
woolen rug, which only partially mutes the subterranean chill of the
chamber.  Shielded lamps light the chamber, both hanging from thick iron
hooks mounted into the ceiling.  The air is close and musty, heavy with the
scents of leather, oil, and parchment.  To the north, an open doorway leads
into a shadowy passage beneath the temple.

heavy woolen rug~
A heavy bjorcha wool rug covers the floor of the library, providing some
of its meager decoration.  It has been stained with kankoran dyes, in
oranges, reds, and browns.  Although worn from the passing of sandals, the
colors form a series of interconnecting geometric patterns.

The Cleansing Pool~
Beneath the temple of Hakurah is a large pool of crystal-clear water. 
The walls around it are bricked with Brintoran stone, and the pool itself is
lined with the same.  The floor is cold, cobbled rock, uneven and absent of
meditation mats.  The major source of light are a collection of candles, set
back into crevices in the bricking.  The air is cool but not especially
damp; its heaviness is largely attributed to the scents of smoke and candle
wax.  The only exit to the room is to the south, leading back to the
stairwell which leads to the surface.
