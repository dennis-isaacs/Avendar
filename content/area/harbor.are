an old, one-legged fisherman~
An old, one-legged fisherman sits in a chair.
~
A grizzled old sailor who has lost his right leg above the knee, this
ancient fisherman now sits in his home, his mind slowly fading from reality.
His withered limbs bear the scars of voyages past, and his eyes appear to be
set in a permanent squint.

say Aye, I was twenty one, and the village girls were all over me.

emote chortles gleefully.
say I had to fight them off, though of course not too hard.
emote pauses for a moment, lost in thought.
say Well, anyway, my friends and I had a ship, a fine ship she was.
say Not very large, but sturdy.  You could count on her.
say Built her with my own two hands I did, cut the trees for her too.
2
say We did all our own work then, not like these days.
emote shakes his head sadly.
2
emote gazes out into the distance as he continues.
say The day was slightly overcast, with a brisk wind.
say We sailed out into the sea, and let out our nets.
say I had feeling though, and dropped my line as well.
say The hours passed, and we were getting a good haul.
say I stuck to my line though, cause my feeling was strong.
say Ha, and then he came.  The big one, a real monster.
say Grabbed my line and dragged the whole ship along.
2
say My friends tried to help bring him in, but I waved them off.
emote waves his hands in demonstration.
say If I couldn\@t bring him in, they wouldn\@t have been able to help.
say He must have pulled her a good league before my line snapped.
say Ha.  Disappeared completely after that, he did.
say Never heard tell of him again, must have scared him off.
say One of these days he\@ll appear again though, and I\@ll have him.

emote trails off, nodding to himself.

section 3~
During the invasion of the red-furred kankoran hordes, the port was
destroyed once more.  With all the military forces arrayed to protect the
city, the port was left defenseless and ripe for plunder.  Nothing remained
of the port except for the great lighthouse, which stood untouched by the
hordes.  It is unknown why the lighthouse remained unscathed, though some
scholars attribute this to superstition on the part of the kankoran.  

The port was immediately rebuilt after that attack in close to its present
form, and a barracks was established to help guard the port from further
destruction.  With the conclusion of the kankoran wars, the port once more
began its rise to prominence.  Under the competent leadership of a
succession of skilled harbormasters, the port has once again become a center
of trade.

each containing one period of the harbor\@s past.  
~
E
section 1~
According to popular myth, Earendam\@s port was originally founded by
Iraren, the grandson of the city\@s founder.  Most historians, however,
believe that the original port grew gradually as a result of the increasing
importance of the sea trade to Earendam\@s economy.  

During the short period immediately preceding the War of Night, the port
grew substantially in size, as many built homes along the shore.  The port
reached its peak of prominence during this time, and plans were drawn up for
a great lighthouse to replace the simple structure of the time.  

An unforunate disaster then struck the port.  An oil lamp was knocked over
during a tavern brawl, and the tavern went up in flames.  The port, a vast,
sprawling collection of closely built wooden structures, was ripe fuel for
the fires, and soon all that was left were the charred ruins of the once
vibrant port.  Many lost their homes and fortunes to the flames, though
fortunately few lives were lost.  
~
E
section 2~
Due to the decrease of trade brought on by the War of Night and the need
to protect the citizens of the city, the port was not rebuilt during the
war.  A few small buildings were erected to handle the trade that did come
in, though even these were abandoned when the city was in danger.  

Following the war\@s end, the senate quickly ordered the rebuilding of the
harbor, as they knew that the sea trade would help stabilize the Republic\@s
finances.  It was during this rebuilding that the great lighthouse, whose
plans had sat untouched since before the war, was finally constructed,
rising above the headland at the northern end of the harbor.  

The sea trade began to flourish once more, though, with Earendam severely
weakened militarily, piracy was a greater danger than it had been before the
war.

A Storage Shed~
Built with thick, sturdy wooden walls, this small shed stands at the
southern end of the shipyards.  A number of roughly-carved cabinets line the
walls of the room, the occasional open drawer revealing an assortment of
tools and other items.  A large stack of barrels stands in one corner, the
scent of pitch drifting through the room and mingling with the smells of
wood and salt water.  Through the doorway to the north the cries of gulls

The Office of Filibrin Dandelon~
Ship designs and ship models fill the walls and shelves of this spacious
office.  All manner of ships are on display, from cogs to skiffs, and each
model is preserved within a glass display case.  By contrast, the desk of
the master of the shipyard is quite plain, a small, wooden table piled high
with papers.  Several chairs have been left about the room, so that
customers might have a place to sit.  The exit from the office lies west,

The Bilge Rat Tavern~
A large room with wood panelling and a hardwood floor, the common room of
the Bilge Rat Tavern is dimly lit by a series of lamps, whose dull glows
shed little light throughout the room.  The tables and other furniture are
worn from frequent use, and the floor is covered in the sticky grime of dirt
and spilled drinks.  About you, the air is filled with talk and laughter,
and the smells of beer and men.  In this corner of the tavern, a number of
booths have been set up to permit private conversation while the rest of the
common room extends to the west and north.
