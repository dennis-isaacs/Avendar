a great blue worm~
A great blue worm writhes amidst a crackling field of bubbles.
~
Long and flat, this massive blue worm writhes its bulk into countless
twists, knots, and angles.  Electric energy thrums all around it creating a
field of super-heated bubbles.  Pale, blue skin seems stretched between its
two lateral lines which are covered in feather-like hairs.  Its large,
oblong head is wider than its body and is mostly mouth.  The disc-shaped maw
contains hundreds of needle-like teeth attached to the edges of fleshy
ridges which are arranged in concentric circles.  A retractable hook-like
beak designed for puncturing and tearing flesh extends from its center.

Kaceajka Rhamki iceguard kankoran black black-furred mob_8606~
Kaceajka Rhamki~
An old, black-furred kankoran, Rhamki the Iceguard, wanders the cave.
~
This kankoran is exceptionally tall with thick, black fur.  About his
snout and ears the fur has grown gray with pale spots of flesh showing
through the thin areas.  Although he is aging he holds fast to his duty and
stands unwavering in stiff posture.  Small bits of frost cling to his back
and shoulders like a shawl of ice that seems to bring him no discomfort at
all.

emote furrows his bushy eyebrows and nods gently to himself.

esay \@points out\@ Though...I find many things odd...about these southern cultures.
esay \@says with a stain of distaste\@ Trophies only hold meaning to the hunter who...earns them.
esay \@scoffs\@ I know not why they would bestow such a meaningless trinket upon me...Like I can\@t muster my own keepsake.  Hmph.

emote pierces the sphere with his claws and a dark miasma swirls throughout it.

emote waves his claw through the mist dispersing it.
\@We...The Kaceajka...have become versed in both.
esay \@moves his claw back and forth\@ The ebb and flow of nature...can be controlled, but...never ceased.
emote closes his eyes and softly chants for a moment in a low tone.
\@Our brethren believe the use of such...unnatural powers...is disruptive, and so they have...renounced us.
esay \@splays his claws apart\@ But we do not tolerate...any imbalance to nature.
esay \@looks towards the Glacial Prison and says\@ We use our abilities to...preserve, encourage, and...eradicate that which threatens to discompose the balance.

esay \@takes a sorrowful breath\@ The northern wastes...as they are known to outsiders...are home to my people.
\@The icy ocean...swells, and the wind chills to the bone.
esay \@says with a hardened pride\@ We...The Kaceajka...have grown to endure...much hardship.
emote shifts his position and points precisely northward.
esay \@growls softly through his words\@ Our brethren in the Ryarl...they were...vexed at our methods.
esay explains We are inherently...different in our opinions...of nature.
emote twirls a finger through the air and a wisp of shadow forms in its wake.
esay \@slices the trail with his claw\@ So we segregated ourselves...long ago...my ancestors traversed the peaks...
\@...of the Korkjva...The mountains where names are lost...and so we became...new.

emote slowly wafts a claw in a wave-like motion.

esay \@holds up four crooked fingers\@ Four sides...like the seasons...
emote cups his claws together and slowly rotates them before his face.
\@...eight runes...like the silver phases.
emote makes a circle with one claw and slowly constricts it into a fist.
esay \@looks through the opening with one eye\@ Five beams of light...like the \#red eye\@s\# gaze.
emote closes his eyes and sighs.

a white sea spider~
A sea spider clings to the wall as it scours the ice with its proboscis.
~
This sea spider has a tiny head with two long, anterior-pointing stalks
without eyes.  Its segmented trunk is oval-shaped with the first three
segments adorned with a large, bell-shaped cowl topped by conical tubercles.
A long abdomen is distinctly segmented at the base where it connects to the
trunk and is carried ventrally at an oblique angle.  A pair of slender legs
grow from each segment which are about three times as long as the main body
and tipped with minute, but apparently functional, fingers.  The entire
exoskeleton is covered in feather-like setae, giving it a hairy appearance.

Kaceajka iceguard kankoran white white-furred mob_8610~
a Kaceajka Iceguard~
An Iceguard of the Kaceajka clan wanders the cave.
~
This tall, white-furred kankoran has a slender frame that is ungracefully
thin.  His ribs are visible through his thick fur, and his tendons stretch
the skin along the back of his legs.  Piercing blue eyes gaze out from his
gaunt face which is surrounded by a frosted, white mane.  Small decorations
of feathers and tiny bones adorn his ears and nape in the fashion of the
Kaceajka clan.

Kzroth glares at you with dark, red eyes seeming to glow in contrast to
his scorched, charcoal black hide.  Ashen flakes fall from his thick skin as
he moves, almost as if his skin is actually burning and chipping off.  He
reeks of urine, death and sulphur, making the air hard to breathe.  In fact,
each breath he expels seems to darken and contaminate the surrounding air. 
Massive hands, tipped with long claws that match the color of scorched
blood, swing at you in unthinking rage.

Offering the faintest blue glow, a magic rune appears imbedded in the ice.~
The Kaceajka pack, or \#Wasteland pack\# to those with the tongue of the
North, are from the edges of the northern coast where the heights of the
Brintor Range meet the cold, battering ocean.  Their skill in the arts of
water are renowned throughout the tribes for being both fearsome and
cunning.  They have a supreme dislike for all things unnatural, and it is
rumored they are the ones responsible for imprisoning the demon Kzroth in
ice after his rampage through Kohlis City.  This appears to be a mystical
Rune of the Rirji Kaceajka, or \#Ocean Wasteland\#.  Normally this type of
rune is used to control the motion of ice flows in northern seas and
waterways.

An Ice-Encrusted Pool~
A still and silent pool of perfect reflection glistens with a cool
shimmer.  The jagged and sloping edges of the chasm are coated with a thin
layer of frost that forms feather-like projections from the sharp edges. 
The air is dense, dark, and heavy.  The pointed angles of the stone walls
are distorted by the frigid, crystal clear water that continues down into

A Frigid Underwater Tunnel~
The water all around you feels extremely dense, like wading through
crystal clear slush.  The rough, stone walls have each nook and crevice
coated with knife-like ice.  The water barely swirls in response to your
motions and seems to push back against every effort.  Dazzling arrays of
color refracted from the faintest glimmer of light twinkle across the
multitude of invisible, floating ice crystals.  

The floor of the tunnel is littered with a mixture of random debris that has
made its way to these depths.  Glints of shiny metal and golden appeal lay
dormant among the remains of those unlucky enough to have fallen this far.

of the water grows intense and makes each movement laborious through the
thick slush.

The passage offers limited courses of travel through narrow openings in
between columns of rock which lay across this twisting tunnel.  Following a
logical path southward leads to a large opening, and twisting through sharp
rocks towards the west the tunnel ascends.  Every handhold is razor-sharp
with ice crystals, and the density of the frigid water makes every motion a
struggle.  Delicate crystalline formations float lazily through the slurry,
some with craggy edges, getting hung up on the stone protrusions.

The tunnel widens into a small chamber whose floor slants drastically to

large space between the rocks leads around a sharp corner to the west.  The
frigid, soupy water resists your every movement as clusters of congealed ice

to squeeze through to a blocked off chamber.  The walls here are smoother

The Path to the Glacial Prison~
This long corridor is decorated with free-standing columns along both
sides with glowing blue crystals resting at their tops.  The floor is tiled
with large, smooth slabs of dark rock, each the size of a dinner table, and
those that make up the center aisle are inscribed with large runes.  The
high, vaulted ceiling almost disappears into the darkness above save for the
gleam of icicles that adorn its surface.  A frosty mist hangs in the chilled
air, and a faint humming can be heard all around.

These smooth, marbled pillars stand about fifteen feet high along the

crystal glowing with a faint blue light.  The patterns cast by the orbs
against the dark stone walls are like light reflecting off water.

as you walk over them.

Before the Glacial Prison~
A narrow bridge of solid, dark rock crosses a deep gap in the ground to
lead from the western corridor to a small plateau.  The semi-circle platform
overlooks an icy underground lake to the north at the base of a steep cliff.
A massive gate of gleaming blue ice is set into the southern wall.  The
arching frame is made of large blocks of ice, each with a glowing rune
emblazoned on its surface.  The structure reaches over thirty feet to the
ice-encrusted ceiling of the cavern.

The Glacial Prison~
You stand inside an icy cell of cyclopean proportions.  Blue walls formed
of massive blocks of ice rise to nearly twenty feet, where they meet a
ceiling crystallized with jagged icicles.  The floor is a single smooth
surface covered by several inches of water that seem to draw the very heat
from your bones.

symbolvision~
You gaze at the Mark of the Damned, examining with care the fine lines
and gouges making its form.  Even as you do so, you feel the world about you
waver and fade..  

You find yourself floating within the void, surrounded by nothingness. 
Soon, the nothingness takes form, appearing as wraithlike figures with
quicksilver eyes.  The lost spirits beckon, whispering promises of knowledge
and power, carressing you with limbs of wispy cold.  You find yourself
moving, if such can be discerned in an unchanging landscape, and after what
seems like an eternity you arrive at a blackened gate hanging in the
nothingness.  

Here your chilling escort fades, but the whispers remain, as well as shining
pinpoints of silver light.  They call for you to step through, to become one
with the power of the void.  You hesistate, and begin to float through. 
Whether this is by your will or that of some malevolent force is unclear. 
You pass through, and all becomes light.  

White fire rages about you, blinding you with its sheer intensity.  Tongues
of flame envelop you and you can feel your flesh blacken and flake like
burnt parchment.  You can not even scream in agony as the very air is burnt
from your lungs, suffocating you even as you are consumed..  

The light fades suddenly, and you find yourself again in Kzroth\@s chamber,
the Mark of the Damned seared into your memory.

E
star eight-sided mark damned symbol~
This inscription is an eight-sided star, in the center of which are three
parallel lines.  The lines are harshly drawn, and are of uneven length,
similar to the markings of some great claw.  Unwholesome runes and glyphs
dot the points of the star, carefully offset from the lines.  

This mark pulses with a blasphemous power all its own.  Perhaps you could
learn more were you to study it.
