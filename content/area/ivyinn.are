tarik man fat~
Tarik~
A fat, bearded man stands behind the bar, surveying the area.
~
Tarik is nearly as wide as he is tall, but manages his weight with ease. 
He makes up for his lack of hair with a curly mustache and beard, and his
bare arms are covered in a thick fuzz.  His eyes are a dark brown, and
barely visible over his round cheeks, but they have a glint of canny
intelligence that his chubby, friendly face otherwise does not portray.

Elarcil~
A strong looking ethron man stands behind the bar, lazily surveying the room.
~
Elarcil stands patiently behind the bar, occaisionally wiping down the
bar or some glasses.  He\@s fairly tall for an ethron, and more than a few
scars mark his face and hands.  Messy dark green hair hangs down nearly to
his shoulders, and his hazel eyes seem languid but aware.

Suli~
A plump cheeked woman bustles about the kitchen.
~
Suli is a sweet looking woman, in her 30\@s, smudges of flour unable to
mask her rosy colour.  She has long brown hair, bound in a bun at the base
of her neck, and a smattering of freckles cover her snub nose.  Suli moves
with the deft assurance that only confidence can bring, and she seems at
home surrounded by the implements of her kitchen.

A dark, curly haired waitress moves confidently throughout the inn.

Clariss has obviously inherited most of her features from her father,
Tarik.  She shares his lack of height, and dark curly hair, though her
figure is nicely curved, if a bit chubby.  She moves throughout the inn with
assurance, a smile for all the regulars, and kind words of greeting.

an alatharya bouncer~
A large burly alatharya looks over the patrons silently, watching for any disturbance.
~
The bouncer is tall, even for an alatharya, though his head is still a
good span from the high ceilings of the Inn.  His long white hair is held
back from his face in a neat ponytail, and streams down his back.  His form
is hardened with muscle and sinew, and various small scars show evidence of
a long past as a warrior of some sort.  For now, he seems content to watch
the crowd, his eyes ever alert for disturbance or theft.

an alatharya bouncer~
An alatharyan man slowly paces the room, watching for trouble.
~
This alatharya man seems a bit older, perhaps a retired of adventurer of
some sort.  His silvery skin seems to have dulled with age, though his eyes
retain the steely glint of one who has done much, and fears little.  He has
an air of confidence and ease that many find comforting who visit the Inn,
and he seems vigilant for any disorder in the room.

a human bouncer~
A strong, wiry woman stands here, watching the crowd intently.
~
The woman seems strong and capable, her muscles slim but clearly defined.
Her hair is a brown so dark it is nearly black, and it is held back from her
face by many smaller braids.  A large scar is barely noticable on her left
cheek, probably recieved quite a long time ago, though the rest of her body
shows little evidence of such marks.  Her movements are quick and deft, and
similarly her gaze scans the crowd, looking for any disturbance.

an ethron bouncer~
A heavy-set ethron is here, relaxed and keeping a watchful eye on the gardens.
~
The ethron is heavily built, though his bulky is much more due to muscle
than fat.  His hair is a messy dark green, and falls into his face despite
best efforts.  It doesn\@t seem to affect his vision at all though, and he
scans the crowd intently, wary for any trouble.  His slow, languid grace is
deceptive, and at any sign of a problem, he is there almost as soon as it
begins.

bard qarista aragil bardess~
Qarista~
Qarista Aragil, bardess of song and lore, stands on the small stage.
~
Qarista\@s beauty and talent are reknowned through-out Avendar, and seeing
her face to face simply confirms all rumours.  Her hair is a dark, shiny
brown, and curls down her back to just below her rather small waist.  Her
skin gleams with vitality and health, a translucent green that looks to be
softer than silk.  Though she is petite, her form is perfectly curved and
her every movement flows with her words.  Her eyes, above all, appeal to the
crowd that watches her, a deep hazel that seem to echo and amplify the
emotion of each song she sings.  Her face and figure pale, however, when
compared to the velvet sweetness of her voice.  As she sings, moving
slightly to the music or running her nimble fingers over the strings of her
lute, her voice echoes with molasses and honey, a sultry soft sound that
seduces even the most cynical of listeners.

ar\@hon arhon bard dusky man~
Ar\@hon~
Ar\@hon, a dusky bard from far-off lands, sits on the small stage.
~
Ar\@hon is somewhat unsettling looking, his bright green eyes almost
glowing in contrast to his dusky dark skin.  His hair is a short and spiky
black; tousled to give him a bit of a rakish, mischievious look.  His hands
are worn and knuckles scarred, much unlike the usual care one would expect a
bard to pay to one of their most valuable possesions, and it adds a slightly
dangerous air to his presence.

Feralak man old ivytourist13~
Feralak~
An old man sits on a chair pulled up next to the fire.
~
Feralek seems bleached by the winds of time, his skin falling in pale
wrinkles, most of which is hidden by his shaggy festucine hair and beard. 
His eyes are a pale turquoise, barely visible under bushy white eyebrows. 
He moves with the slow, awkward dignity of the aged, limbs and muscles now
protesting the abuse of the past.  His voice, when he speaks, belies his
age, a smooth and low tenor that soothes the ear.  A faint smell seems to
permeate his clothing, something like the smell of the air after a
rainstorm, fresh but slightly of the sea.

the young man~
A handsome young man sits at a cherrywood table, smiling happily.
~
This \@man\@ seems he has barely reached the term, his bright eyes and
smooth skin betraying his youth.  His eyebrows are a dark brown, contrasting
with his short, light blond hair, and they match his thick black eyelashes. 
His eyes are a clear midnight blue, wide and expressive.  He seems somewhat
tall for a human, and though he is not extremely muscular looking, he seems
fit and quite hale.

A pretty young lady sits at a cherrywood table, cheeks flushed a rosy red.
~
Brown hair nearly so pale as to be blonde falls around the girls face in
ribbons of curls, defying the attempt she has apparently made to tie her
hair in a ponytail at the back of her head.  Her face is heart shaped, and
her mouth though bare of paint, is a dark rose pink.  Her movements are
contained and self-conscious, eyes hidden by long lashes as she looks down
at the table.

loose ponytail, framing a handsome, if arrogant, face.  His high cheekbones
and chiseled jaw seem more suited to a diplomat than the warrior that he
seems to be, sword hanging easily from his hip.  In contrast to his
marble-cold good looks, his smile is slow and warm, and he draws the gaze of

down her back.

Jaeristil has long white-blond hair, with a single, thin braid trailing
down on the left side of his head.  His eyes are a placid honey brown that
seem only a few shades darker than his translucent gold skin.  His form is
thin, almost gangly, and clearly attests to a life spent in libraries and
apothocaries, rather than in battle.  He is quietly examining the books in
the library, reading with an ardent intensity, quickly flipping from page to
page.

A brown-haired ethron man sits at the bar.

Large dark brown eyes solemnly examine the world around Alyristil, barely
visible under the hair of almost the exact same hue.  His face is strong and
slightly angular, his skin the pale green common to ethron.  He seems rather
quiet and thoughtful, though the stubborn set of his jaw belies a strong
inner will.  Alyristil wears a variety of armor, all of it well cared for,
and it accentuates his muscular form.  His flail is ready at his side, but
he doesn\@t seem as prone to using it as one may assume from his powerful
form.  Instead, Alyristil is content to watch, speaking rarely, and only
after consideration.

A brown-furred kankoran prowls through the Common Room.

Still bearing evidence of a long journey on the roads, it is difficult to
see the colour of Rhakotil\@s fur beneath all the dust and dirt he has
accumulated.  His eyes are a surprisingly vivid green, surrounded by tufts
of brownish black fur, and beneath them his muzzle is slightly open, showing
glints of sharp yellow teeth.  He looks quite bulky and strong, and
extremely out of place among the crowd of patrons in the inn.

Small black eyes glint from a rather unremarkable face, only
distinguished by a fine, thin scar running from his left ear down to his
jaw.  His skin in a dark chocolate in colour, only slightly lighter than his
eyes.  He is quite thin, though muscled, but his wings seem a bit shorter
than they ought to be when considering the length of his arms.  As a
consequence, it seems, he flies with a slightly jumpy gait, and currently
can hardly do even that, with his arms burdened with more than one plate of
food.

Isijora~
A caladaran woman sits by the pond, examining the various plants that flourish around it.
~
The first thing that stands out about Isijora is her long mahogany hair,
woven with ivy and leaves from the forest.  The green of the leaves causes
her hair to look more red in hue, and brings out the similar paler green in
her almond shaped eyes.  Her skin is a dark oaken hue, weathered and tanned
by growing up outdoors, but fairly smooth to the touch.  

Long-limbed and willowy, Isijora is fairly tall, even for one of her race. 
Her movements are slight and silent, carrying with her an aura of placidity.
Her hands, though delicate and deft, betray an inner energy and emotion.  As
she speaks or falls into thought, they are constantly moving, fidgeting and
gesturing to illustrate her ideas.

\#They have given up their lives and meaning to you because yours was the
path of least resistance.  These empty husks cannot be relied upon to save
your life.  If you had lead a life of challenge and strife, instead of
living a life of ease, hidden behind the excuse of your Vow of Pacifism and
content behind the so-called safety of your masses and sainthood, then
perhaps you could have had a chance.\#  Stated Vashel in a calm voice.  She
watched impassively as Brezistem cried a scream of rage and sorrow as he
reached within his robe to pull out a hidden dagger and attempted to charge
her with nothing on his mind but the preservation of his own life.  

With a single fluid motion, Vashel unsheathed her blade with god-like speed
and slew the raving holy man as he charged with a flimsy dagger in his hand.
In that same fluid motion she had turned and proceeded to walk down the path
of the mountain, as the pitiful cries of Brezistem\@s followers welled up
behind her, as they realized that now they would once again have the
responsibility to make and accept the consequences of their own actions.  

With that our tale ends, as Vashel heads from her fourth Trial: to slay two
men, as different from each other as light is to day, but yet similar in
less obvious ways.  Both though different, had the same corrosive affect
upon the people around them, and both had been silenced so that people in
that day and age could be forged to a higher potential.  From this fourth
Trial, Vashel strode purposefully onwards to her fifth, unmindful of the
need for rest, but only with the purpose of finishing her quest on her mind.

~
E

It was then upon the eve to a dark night that Vashel climbed the
mountain, carrying a torch to announce her presence.  To all whom asked,
Vashel announced that she had come to slay their holy man, Brezistem.  His
followers were aghast, but were unable even to muster a suitable defense
against her.  Too many of them were stricken by the realization that their
Oath barred their way, and could do nothing but stand by as they saw her
climb trail up the mountain.  Some attempted to form a barrier before her,
but days of fasting and lack of physical activity had left them too weak to
truly even be noticed by Vashel as she swept by.  

Thus it was utter simplicity once more for Vashel to climb to the summit of
the mountain, where Brezistem had chosen to live, surrounded by his
followers whom he treated as servants in return for his teachings.  Here he
stood by the door as he cried plaintively to Vashel when she strode close,
\#Why?  Why do you do this, and why do my followers not save me from my
peril?\#  

\#Because you have corrupted these servants of yours so that they are nothing
but shadows, without will and honor.  This new world and age requires beings
of strength who are willing to enter the crucible to be made stronger and
purer, not those who do not even have the will to make decisions for
themselves\# replied Vashel.

\#Why?  Why do you do this, and why do my followers not save me from my

requires beings of strength who are willing to enter the crucible to be made
stronger and purer, not those who do not even have the will to make
decisions for themselves\# replied Vashel.  \#They have given up their lives
and meaning to you out of fear and coercion.  These empty husks cannot be
relied upon to save your life.  If you had but remained the warrior you were
in the past, instead of living a life of sloth, content behind the so-called
safety of your masses, then perhaps you could have had a chance.\#  Stated
Vashel in a calm voice as she unsheathed her blade with god-like speed and
slew the cowering Onzen upon his throne.  In that same fluid motion she had
turned and proceeded to walk out of the Dark Valley, without a single motion
of resistance by Onzen\@s thousands of followers.  

The second mortal for the fourth trial dwelled high in the mountains.  He
was a holy messiah by the name of Brezistem, who was known by many as the
Saint of Peace.  Legend has it that Brezistem had gone through life, never
taking the life of another.  In his middle years he retreated to a mountain
where he gathered followers, whom he then preached the art of peace to. 
Each of them had sworn a Vow of Pacifism, to never harm the life of another.
Thousands of his followers upon the mountain awoke each morning to fasting
and meditation, in order so that they could more quickly reach a state where
they would never be able to harm the life of another ever again.

It was Vashel however that pursued a path less traveled.  She walked to
test her skills and her mettle, but in doing so she also wished to prove the
worth of these new races to the eyes of the Gods.  While the alatharya had
brought dishonor to all mortals by their jealousy and treachery, Vashel
strove to show that the new races would not stray down that path.  It would
come to be that after a score of years, Vashel\@s quest finally captured the
attention of Dolgrael, the Divine of War.  The legendary year-long
discussion between the two, deep within the Forge of Dolgrael, are the stuff
and myth of another tale entirely, but suffice to say that at the end of it,
an accord had been reached.  Dolgrael had given Vashel nine Trials to prove
to him the worth of these new races.  And with that she set out, not yet
knowing that these trials in their entirety would span the length of
decades, but such was her resolve that even had she known she would only
have moved onward with the same determination.  

With that our tale begins, as Vashel heads to face her fourth Trial: to slay
two men, as different from each other as light is to day, but yet similar in
less obvious ways.  The first man was named Onzen, the self titled Tyrant of
the Dark Valley.  Onzen was known and feared throughout his region as a once
powerful warrior that had conquered the valley, and built his dark throne
there.  From there, his enslaved worshippers performed dark rites and
sacrifices to appease their master.  

To slay this foe Vashel approached the valley at the dawn of the new day. 
Tired and dazed from their night of unholy rituals, most of Onzen\@s
followers were too befuddled to even consider a resistance.  Of the
thousands massed in the valley, most of them had already lost their will to
fight and were but empty shells that only blindly accepted the orders of
their master.  Thus it was utter simplicity for Vashel to stride to the
center of the valley, where Onzen sat upon his throne.  It became apparent
from a distance that Onzen the mighty warrior had atrophied from years of
indulgent living, and now could barely muster the energy to move himself
from his throne.  When finally Onzen became cognizant of his danger, his
shrill voice carried far and high, demanding first assistance, and then to
beg for mercy when none of his followers would stand against Vashel.

\@The Fourth Trial of Vashel\@

Recorded by Nehruin, high priest of the Lord Dolgrael

In those days following the Sundering the races knew fear for the world had
been changed, and paradise had been lost forever.  In those dangerous times
mortals were forced to forge new paths and new ways to survive.  Magic and
lore had been divided, and as the dangers of the wild encroached, people
clung to whatever fragments would suit them best.  Those who lived within
the woods practiced the arts of forest and nature, while those who lived in
the mountains lived and died by the arts of stone and earth.  But even in
these dangerous times, there were those people who thrived in the
possibilities of the age.  These were the people who spent not their lives
purely on the basis of survival, but on something far more epic.  

One of these mortals came from a village whose name has long since been lost
to the ashes of time.  She was Vashel, the first mistress of the sword art
known as Aktzezehye\@ginta, a sword form known for the deadly speed in which
a blade could be unsheathed.  Often for the masters of the Aktzezehye\@ginta,
it is possible to slay ones foe, without the foe ever realizing the blade
has been drawn.  

While not much is known of Vashel\@s beginnings, it is known that she and her
brother were two sides of a same coin.  One walked with a tune in his heart
and wanderlust in his soul, the other walked with the grim resolve of a soul
of steel and the calm quiet of determination in her heart.  But both knew
honor and courage, and it was that which held these two sides together.

book brown dark leather volume one gemstones avendar~
As any earth scholar would be pleased to tell you, stone is very
important to the world of magic.  Even more so, however, are the precious
and semi-precious gems we mine from it.  Few things are as potent as a
channel, and focus, as the correct gemstone used in the correct manner.  

While any gem, and really any thing, can be enchanted thus, certain gems
have an undeniable affinity with particular abilities and protections.  One
could enspell an emerald or a citrine, for example, to grant the user
extended mental energies, and such an enchantment would hold.  Had the
caster been more particular, and used a pearl perhaps, the benefit of that
same spell could have as much as tripled!  

Within these pages I shall give brief outlines of the description of each
stone, and a short summary of the folklore and traits associated with them. 
Indeed, one need not be able to channel magic to find benefit from many of
the gems listed herein.  

Included in this volume are the following stones: Amber, Amethyst,
Aquamarine, Bloodstone, Carnelian, Citrine, Diamond, Emerald and Garnet.  
~
E
amber~
AMBER
=====
Generally a brownish orange to light yellow in colour, amber tends to 
be translucent, even when unpolished.  The kankorans believe it to be 
solidified sunlight, and value the gem highly.  The kohli people value 
the stone even more so, as it is quite rare in their cave habitats, and 
it holds some religious significance as well.

A weak stone as far as magical ability is concerned, it is useful for 
minor benefits, or occasionally as an aid for channeling air magics.  
Many wise women and healers praise it for its positive effects on those 
who have arthritis or similar pains of the joints.
~
E
amethyst~
AMETHYST
========
This type of quartz is renown for its lovely purple colour; the more 
intense the hue, the more valued the gem.  A great many scholars wear 
this stone, as it aids in meditation and mental tranquility.  Some people
also use it in day-to-day life, as it is thought to give a boost to the
immune system.  Some nobles are partial to goblets adorned with amethysts,
or carved entirely out of the stone, as it is said to curb drunkenness.

For those who study arcane magic, this stones power is limited, at 
best.  Many of those newer to the magics of enchantment may erroneously 
believe its deep purple colour would lend itself to properties spiritual 
in nature (due to the seventh chakra).  In actuality the flawed nature 
of amethyst quartz does not hold well any spells cast upon it.
~
E
aquamarine~
AQUAMARINE
==========
Another fairly weak gem magically speaking, the aquamarine is none-the-
less valued highly in some cultures.  Sailors and those who live close
to the ocean believe the stone lucky, and superstitiously think it to
bring good fortune to seafarers.  The origin of this belief is unclear, 
but it is thought to be a practice of worship for some long forgotten 
god.  In some villages the strength of their belief is so strong that if 
a person accidentally cracks or breaks a piece of aquamarine, they will 
not sail for a full year, believing baleful spirits will seek revenge.
~
E
bloodstone~
BLOODSTONE
==========
Despite its name, bloodstone is a deep pine green in colour.  It actually
gets its name from the flecks of dark red buried within the green rock,
said to be the crystallized remains of the blood of Varharl, the legendary
titan.  People today generally wear it for aid with their circulation, but
there is little magical worth in it beyond that.

Bloodstone is, of course, the birthstone of the month of the Sundering, 
the month Varharl gave his life to save many of the inhabitants of 
Avendar.
~
E
carnelian~
CARNELIAN
=========
Carnelian is a lovely bright orange to reddish orange colour, which 
slowly becomes more and more red the longer it is left in the sun.  Yet 
another variety of quartz, it aids clear thinking as many of the quartz 
family do.  It is also said to be good for the skin, clearing blemishes 
and aiding the healing of scars and such marks.  It is a useful stone 
in that it can be enchanted with many minor enchantments, but shows no 
clear bias to any particular magic.

Carnelian is the stone of the Reaping, and is oft worn by children of that
month to promote fertility.
~
E
citrine~
CITRINE
=======
Citrine tends to a bright yellow in colour, and bears a close relation 
to amethyst in formation, though is less favoured.  A fairly common 
stone, it is a symbol of loyalty, faithfulness, and youth.  It is also 
said that wearing a piece of citrine about the throat brings energy to the 
wearer.

It is best enchanted with protective magics, but is relatively poor at 
holding any other sort of spell.  Therefore, it is often put aside in 
favour of strong cousins.

Its sparkling warm colour destined it to be the birthstone of those 
born during the Dawning.
~
E
diamond~
DIAMOND
=======
Arguably among the most powerful of stones, diamonds are valued by 
scholars and nobles alike.  While they are quite rare, they are also 
difficult to mine, causing their value on the market to be quite high!

The gem itself is said to bring clarity of thought, an obvious aid to any
spellcaster.  Beyond that, it holds well nearly any enchantment put upon
it.  It is especially useful at absorbing spells that grant the wearer
resistance to hostile magics, and increased mental energy.  Diamonds are
also useful in that they amplify the other stones powers, making anything
they are set with much stronger.

Some scholars theorize that the hardness of a stone, that is its 
durability and difficulty to break, is directly related to the strength of 
the enchantments it can hold.  Indeed, the diamond seems to be a prime 
example of this phenomenon (termed the Grasie Rule by the scholar who
first set it out, Rolane Grasie.)
~
E
emerald~
EMERALD
=======
An exquisite green stone, and somewhat rare, the emerald has long been 
a favourite among bards and storytellers.  Beyond the simple beauty of 
the stone, which makes it a natural choice for those who make their 
living on the stage, the emerald is easy to enspell with glamours to make 
the owner more appealing.  Also, to sleep wearing an emerald is said to 
enhance the dreams of the sleeper, leaving them inspired by the realms 
of their unconscious when they wake.
~
E
garnet~
GARNET
======
Usually a deep red in colour, garnet can rarely also be found in shades 
of blue and purple.  Often, unless held up to the light, a garnet can 
appear to be a solid black.  A common aid for memory, and worn to ward 
off headaches and nightmares, garnet is a fairly mundane stone, and 
frequently found in srryn beadwork.

Though it is not a particularly strong stone, garnet is useful for 
minor enchantments, and is especially good at warding off the cold, when 
used correctly.

Garnet is the birthstone for the month of Valectis, and is thought to 
bring luck and warmth to those born during this cold month.

pearl~
PEARL
=====
Pearls are formed inside shellfish, and are found in various shades of 
white, pink, and black.  Many cultures have independently adopted the 
pearl as a symbol of chastity and purity, and they are common in the 
jewelry of young female nobles.

Pearls are fairly strong, and quite useful at enhancing and extending 
mental capabilities.  Black pearls are especially good at providing 
resistances to various types of magics.
~
E
opal~
OPAL
====
Opal is among the most valuable of gems, and is usually found in a 
sparkling white, though it also comes in hues of black, blue, and red 
(fire opal).  It is extremely useful for arcane rituals, and can be quite 
a powerful aid for astral projection.  According to Nefortu lore, opals 
are the singed and melted remains of clouds touched by Bayyal, that then 
fell to the earth.  Regardless of origin, opals tend to be found by the 
water, and must be soaked thoroughly on occasion to keep their shine.

The different shades of opals are useful for different things, though all 
share an affinity for protection magics of some sort.  Blue opals are best 
at protection from harmful magics, and bring luck to travelers on long
voyages, especially across the sea.  Black opals aid the health of the 
wearer, and are among the most powerful to enchant.  Fire opals, those of 
a reddish orange colour, are extremely tricky to enchant as the results 
are difficult to predict, but they have a large amount of potential.

book blue dark leather volume two gemstones avendar worn~
Welcome to the second volume of Gemstones of Avendar.  Within these pages
are descriptions and information on the following stones: Hematite, Jade,
Jasper, Lapis Lazuli, Malachite, Moonstone, Obsidian, Onyx, Opal and Pearl. 
~
E
hematite~
HEMATITE
========
Hematite is a semi-precious gem favoured by warriors and templars.  It is
a deep silvery black that when ground on a polishing wheel, turns the
water cooling it to a dark bloody red.  Kankorans call this gem \#Darrack\#,
and in times past would strap cloth beaded with hematite over wounds in
battle, believing it to staunch blood and give them strength to continue.
The kankoran people are not the only ones to attribute such things to the
stone; many cultures believe the gem to grant the user willpower and
courage.

Hematite holds minor enchantments well, especially those of physical
durability and stamina.  As for more powerful magics, it is not as useful
as many other gems, and requires a skilled caster indeed to evoke
stronger enchantments.

Birthstone of the month of Tyrilis, gifting a child of that month with
hematite jewelry is thought to assure them health and long life.
~
E
jade~
JADE
====
Commonly ranging from a pale ivory green to a deep moss green, jade can
rarely be found in colours such as white, red, black, and yellow.  The
most rare, and also most mystically powerful type of jade is a milky 
lavender in colour.  Known for encouraging calmness and cool, logical
thought, jade is quite popular in jewelry and small sculpture.  Simply
touching a piece of jade is considered lucky in the southern wastes,
where they believe the stone bestows a blessing on the user.

Jade lends itself to enchantments that boost and aid the intellect, but
it is a fairly powerful focus and will work well with most enchantments.

The wisdom and clarity of the Titan Nelena naturally led jade to be the
birthstone of her month, Nelennamir.
~
E
jasper~
JASPER
======
Jasper is a variety of chalcedony that comes in many colours, and is oft
used in beadwork.  It is believed to help vision, both physical sight and
also psychic foresight.  It\@s also thought to protect the wearer against
snake and spider bites.  As an arcane stone, its value is negligible.
~
E
lapis lazuli~
LAPIS LAZULI
============
This stone is a medium, opaque blue, often veined with white, and
sparkles with golden flecks in the light.  It is favoured by royalty,
and is thought to help protect the wearer from evil.  In folklore a
somewhat opposing idea is put forth, that vampires wear this gem to
protect them from the harmful rays of the sun.  Regardless, lapis is
rather weak, best at enchantments that aid the mind.

Lapis lazuli is the birthstone for the month of Lyceonis, and often
worn during times of strife to aid the user in overcoming their
troubles.
~
E
malachite~
MALACHITE
=========
Malachite is a deep green stone, banded with stripes of dark green or
black.  Most people are already familiar with this gem as it is said to
protect children, especially from sickness and disease.  It is a quite
common decoration on cradles and in childrens jewelry.  It is also
believed to bring patience and reduce tension.

Malachite is quite delicate and breaks easily, and following the Grasie
Rule, it is quite difficult to enchant.

Elanthemir, being a common month for births, hosts this gem as its
birthstone.
~
E
moonstone~
MOONSTONE
=========
The shimmery gem comes in a variety of colours, though always shines blue
or white.  The most precious (and powerful) moonstones are those of a
nearly colourless white, that shine blue in the light.  Moonstones have
many connections to the spiritual realm, and are often used by sages to
help them remember past lives.

While this stone is weak on its own, when paired with a diamond or sapphire,
it can be quite a powerful tool for the unconscious.  For this reason it is
very popular with spirit scholars, both as jewelry and as a magical aid.

Moonstone is said to bring peaceful sleep and safety, especially to those
out at night, to those born during Kyanamir.
~
E
obsidian~
OBSIDIAN
========
Obsidian is simply a form of cooled lava that tends to a glassy black
colour.  Varieties of it include snowflake obsidian, which is weaker and
flawed with small white marks (the \@snowflakes\@), and apache\@s tear, which
is a translucent brown when held up to the light.  It has been used for
centuries as mirrors, and more commonly as blades and arrowheads.

There are many negative connections to this stone, as it is often used in
sacrificial blades, and indeed some of the negative impressions are valid.
While this stone is fairly strong, especially at protecting the user from
magical attack, it is difficult to enchant the gem without causing it to
drain the wearer as well.  Often those who use obsidian talismans are frail
and more prone to sickness.

Obsidian was at one time considered the birthstone for those born during
Lyceonis, but the disfavour this gem has fallen in to caused it to be
replaced by lapis lazuli.
~
E
onyx~
ONYX
====
Pure onyx tends to be black, though is not uncommonly found in shades of
white, grey and brown.  It is mostly used for decoration, though it is
supposed to aid in clear thinking and positivity.  Onyx is pretty common,
and is without par in its ability to protect the wearer from hostile
spells.  A more rare variety, sardonyx, which is a deep reddish colour,
is even stronger, and is also useful in honing the intellect of the user.

Onyx is the stone for the month of the Setting, and sardonyx is considered
especially lucky for those born during this time.

turquoise~
TURQUOISE
=========
A marbly, somewhat lumpy stone, turquoise gets its name from its bright,
opaque hue.  This stone is oft associated with singers and public
speakers, as it is thought to bring fluidity of speech and to improve
lung capacity.  As it is fairly soft and easy to find, it has been used
in jewelry for many centuries by all manners of people.

It is fairly weak, magically speaking, though just about any culture could
give you a myth or story associated with the gem.  In more recent times,
it is usually enchanted with such things as a bard may request, but the
stone shows no particular affinity with anything.

Turquoise is the stone of the month of Converumir, and when worn on those
summer days, thought to bring protection from danger to the wearer.
~
E
tourmaline~
TOURMALINE
==========
A rather interesting stone, tourmaline grows in straight rods, rather than 
the usual crystalline formation.  It comes in many hues, most commonly
purple, green, and pink.  While not typically an abundant stone, it can
usually be found in mountains in the warmer areas of Avendar.

Green tourmaline is said to bring balance and peace of heart to men, and
the pink, to women.  It is also quite useful for enchantments that boost
the awareness and agility of the user.
~
E
tiger tigers eye tigerseye~
TIGER\@S EYE
===========
Tiger\@s eye is a banded brown and black stone, and when tilted in the
light, the colours seem to shift and move.  It can also be found in other
colours which share the same properties as the original stone: Cat\@s Eye
(green), Bull\@s Eye (red), and Hawk\@s Eye (blue).  It is commonly worn as
beads and earrings, and is thought to ground a person, and soften
stubbornness.  As a focus for spells, tiger\@s eye is useful for aiding the 
health of the user, but little else.

The birthstone for the month of the Burning, it is said to gift someone born
during this month with a piece of tiger\@s eye will protect them from the
ill winds of fate (though possibly at the expense of the giver!)
~
E
sunstone~
SUNSTONE
========
It is said until the War of the Night, sunstone was simply a brown variety 
of agate.  But upon the entry of the ch\@taren into the realm, this stone 
began to sparkle and gleam, earning its current name.  Regardless of the 
truth of this story, sunstone is a warm orangish brown in colour with many 
tiny specks of gold that reflect and sparkle in even the dimmest light.  
This stone is sacred to the followers of Rystaia, and is thought to give 
any who wear it courage and positivity in the face of despair.

Sunstone is somewhat uncommon, but is an excellent tool in defending the 
mind against mental attack or intrusion.  It is also fairly useful in 
granting the wearer extended health and psychic energy.

Sunstone is the birthstone for the month of Rystaiamir, and it is thought 
that children who carry sunstone with them will grow up to be good-natured 
and humble.
~
E
sapphire~
SAPPHIRE
========
Sapphires are closely related to rubies and share many of their same 
properties.  While the most famous sapphires are blue, they actually do 
come in a variety of colours, such as yellow, orange, green and pink.  
Sapphires are thought to be a beneficial aid to enhancing psychic 
abilities.

Sapphires are sacred to Jolinn, and for this reason they are a popular 
choice as a tool for channeling water magics.  For any water scholar, the 
sapphire is the gem of choice for any enchantment; for the blessings of 
Jolinn and the strength and flexibility of the gem.
~
E
ruby~
RUBY
====
Sometimes referred to as \#the blood of sorcerers\#, ruby is a deep 
transparent red.  It aids in circulation and problems of the blood, and 
revitalizes the user.  Known as a gem of passion, it is a popular 
adornment on wedding bands.  An extremely powerful gem (and second in 
hardness only to diamond), rubies can be enchanted to hold nearly any 
spell.  Above all they are best at extending mental and physical energies.  
Star rubies are highly valued as well, though more for their appearance 
than any particular aid magically speaking.
~
E
rose~
ROSE QUARTZ
===========
Rose quartz is, as the name implies, a lovely pink variety of quartz.  It 
is thought to bring emotions to the surface, and when worn with amethyst, 
brings love to the wearer.  It is a tradition in caladaran culture to gift 
someone with a piece of rose quartz if you seek his or her forgiveness in 
some matter.  For obvious reasons, this stone is oft associated with 
Aeolis, and is held sacred by his followers.

A fairly frail and weak gem, it is best at enchantments to aid the user in 
being charming and glib.  Some level of protective magics can be cast upon 
it as well, but it does not excel in any aspect.
~
E
quartz~
QUARTZ
======
Quartz is sometimes unfairly termed the \#poor mans diamond\#, but is 
actually quite useful of its own right.  It helps balance mind and body, 
and is commonly used as a focus for other gems.  Smoky quartz, which is a 
beautiful translucent brown, is without par when enchanted to aid the 
health of the wearer.  Often other gems are used in lieu of smoky quartz 
when such benefits are needed because this variety of quartz is extremely 
rare on this continent.

Some types of quartz occasionally have streaks of golden looking rutile 
within it.  These pieces of quartz are called rutilated quartz, and 
generally occur only in clear and smoky varieties (not the subtypes of 
quartz such as amethyst, citrine, etc).  Smoky rutilated quartz is valued 
highly by healers for its benefits in speeding recovery of the gravely 
ill.

The most valuable of all forms of quartz to the scholar and mage is termed 
\#phantom quartz\#, and has a second (or third, or more) quartz fragment 
grown inside the larger piece.  It is best left unpolished, and can be 
enchanted to bring extensive mental energies to the user when held.
~
E
peridot~
PERIDOT
=======
This is a fairly common stone that is found only in a warm, olive green.  
It is thought to help one realize their dreams, and enhance their 
creativity, so it is very popular among artists and writers.  As a magical 
gem, it is fairly simply to enchant with spells to make the user more 
agile and quick, but extremely difficult to enchant it with anything else.

Peridot is the birthstone for the month of Year\@s End.  Wearing it,
especially during this month, is thought to bring optimism and hope to
the user.

No one knows exactly how the Hyacinthe Girl rid Inessa of its ogre she
insisted she wanted to face the ogre alone and assured the village she would
return without harm done to head nor foot.  Ask any villager (young and old)
to tell the tale and their answers will vary.  Some will say she warded the
village with self-grown hyacinthes planted on the outskirts where forest
melts into village path, wards that the ogre could not overcome nor overstep
no matter how persistent, driven in the opposite direction by madness and
confusion.  Others will say she exchanged words with the ogre (the Hyacinthe
Girl was supposedly quite proficient in ogre-tongue) and asked him in quiet,
civil, nightingale tones to leave Inessa and restrict his hunting to Morn. 
As the story goes, when the ogre refused, the Hyacinthe Girl took a
hyacinthe from a small but simple, worn herb pouch and gave it to the ogre. 
Smirking, the ogre attempted to crush, destroy and rid itself of the
hyacinthe and the Hyacinthe Girl, but to no avail.  The cursed and
ogre-warded hyacinthe eventually drove the ogre mad and into the higher
crests and cliffs north of Inessa where he gibbered, drooled and ate dirt
for sustenance years on end, nearly wasting to unimaginable frailty.  But
the story most villagers do not tell yet believe, is the Hyacinthe Girl
merely looked at the filthy ogre with her silver moonlit tinted eyes for a
moment, to the ogre, longer than eternity itself and the ogre fled.  

Whichever story is true (or not), Inessa was ogre-free from the day the
Hyacinthe Girl returned from the forest unharmed, until her timely death
seventy years later.  Villagers also say when the Hyacinthe Girl died (her
lips still stained raspberry, her cheeks smooth and her eyes still haunted
with silver moonlight) all hyacinthes from the Sea of Lidreau to Var Bandor
crumbled and wilted with her.  Some also say the ogre returned (knowing of
the death of the Hyacinthe Girl) to extract revenge upon the village which
harboured the girl who drove him to madness, insanity and eating dirt. 
Whichever story you believe, to this day villagers under the tutelage of the
druids of Eril attempt to grow magically-warded hyacinthes which never bloom
to maturity.  Other villagers have learned to hunt during seventy years
(passing along the knowledge to their children) and some have even been
successful at driving the ogre back to the northern cliffs for months on
end.  But as if for assurance or protection, on each hunt the villagers
carry a single hayacinthe in his pouch naturally cultivated by Anya in hopes
that somehow someway the spirit of the Hyacinthe Girl is still alive.  
~
E
three~
But not long after the Hyacinthe Girl came to be one with the village of
Inessa, a forest ogre began to ravage the village and the surrounding areas.
The ogre was a filthy beast that smelled of sour, rotting things and took a
liking for young tender meat, not caring if the meat was of songbird,
wolf-pup, yearling or cooing infant.  With fear and anger on knitted brow
and coated with words of bravado, Inessa amassed its villagers to kill the
ogre.  Belarik the Smith even offered weapons and armor for the triumphant
one who returned to his smithy with the ogres head, an offer he made after
the ogre attempted to devour his son and the wolf-pup one dusky winter eve.

Of course, none were successful in their hunt.  Inessa was not a village of
warriors it was a village of tanners, masons, wheelwrights,
horticulturalists and homesteaders.  The villagers did not know how to hunt
and kill the ogre their hunting was limited to deer and the occasional rogue
silver-maned wolf that found the strange smells of the village curious and
enticing.  The villagers were not surprised when they saw their neighbours
and sons and fathers and uncles return without a vaguely head-shaped
blood-stained burlap sack or when some of those same neighbours and sons and
fathers and uncles returned maimed and mangled, or even without beating
hearts and blood coursing through veins.  But just the same, none were
surprised when the Hyacinthe Girl sought out the village elders and meekly
offered to rid Inessa of its ogre problem for nothing at all.  One long look
in her eyes and you knew she could rid the world of the moon if she so
wished.

Most people were unsettled by the gaze of the Hyacinthe Girl and for good
colour of a moonlit forest at night.  If she were not smiling, if she were
seemingly pondering thoughts that kings, lord high generals and patricians
would only ponder, if she were gazing in the distance as if she were afraid
(or amused) the horizon would reach out and kiss her with a soft tenderness
on those raspberry-stained lips of hers, one thought insane violence was
ready to erupt from within, unleashed on whomever was about.  But if she
smiled at you, if she graced you with a lovely grin, well, you felt as if
you were the only in your world and hers and eternity with her had just
begun.  

So, it was no wonder the village of Inessa quickly took to the Hyacinthe
Girl and welcomed her as one of their own.  When Arik the Tanner made his
daily walk to his shop every morning, he stopped not only to speak to Inessa
the rowan tree but to the Hyacinthe Girl also as she frolicked and played
with Tomik and his wolf-pup.  In turn, for the gratitude and the food and
sleeping pallet a different villager offered her each night, the Hyacinthe
Girl acted as their village healer, vanishing poison ivy rashes before the
villagers eyes, providing natural antidote and antiseptic for venom bites
from insect and reptile alike and even mixing the occasional herbal
concoctions for hang-over cures.  Yes, the village of Inessa took the
Hyacinthe Girl as one of her own and even adored her, as long as they didnt
look to long in her silver-moonlit shining eyes.

book ogre hyacinthe girl worn green leather~
The Ogre and the Hyacinthe Girl

by Cifete Elath-del

No one was quite sure where the Hyacinthe Girl came from.  One chill autumn
morn she appeared in Inessa as if she walked there upon the red-gold rays of
the sun itself, her laugh like nightingale song, while she played and
frolicked with Tomik and his wolf-pup near the rowan tree.  Some of the
villagers believed her to be the daughter of muttering Old Althea of Morn,
for the Hyacinthe Girl was an herbalist like Inessa had never seen before
and probably will never see again.  Other villagers believed her to be the
love-child of a tryst between druid Rhuidar of the far northern mountains
and druidess Alisren of Nendor the powerful regenerative herblore of the
Hyacinthe Girl could rival some of the lesser water scholars and only a
druidess with such herblore would be taught that knowledge at the knee of
such powerful druid-parents.  Who the Hyacinthe Girl truly was not divined
and she wasnt telling when asked whence from she came she would tilt her
head teasingly and chuckled her nightingale-laugh as she responded, \@From
the forest.  \@

The Hyacinthe Girl was a truly beautiful creature and made the men of Inessa
quickly forget Anya and her supple deerskin leggings.  Her lips looked as if
she had been tasting raspberries all morn, her nose was as pert as a
toddling child, her wheat-blonde mussed hair was woven with hawthorn flowers
and juniper cone-berries, her stature was sleek, willowy and lithe and her
eyes--- well her eyes were certainly her most interesting feature.

Outside The Oak And Ivy Inn~
Winding lengths of green ivy creep upwards along the worn stone exterior
of a moderately-sized building, from which a finely painted sign hangs
proclaiming it to be the \@Oak and Ivy\@.  Against the walls below stem
seemingly well-tended rose bushes, intertwining with the tangled vines.  A
beaten dirt path leads in from the main road to the west, ending at a sturdy
wooden door which provides entry into the inn.  A large rock sits nearby,
its top smoothed from use.  Paned windows are inset on either side of the
door, through which flickering torchlight can be seen inside.

A large, polished bar extends out from the western wall, running parallel

has been taken in keeping the surface from becoming tarnished or scratched
over time, the loving hand of the bartender obvious.  Candles flicker from
within worked glass jars sitting on top of the bar, the light reflecting
warmly off the shining wood.  Hanging on the wall behind the bar is a small
chalkboard, informing patrons about current events and specials of the day.

A Cozy Corner of the Common Room~
This corner of the inn is set apart from the common room, its area
instead occupied by many comfortable looking chairs and couches, along with
a number of short tables and stands.  All of the furniture here has been
very worn in, giving it an inviting presence.  The lighting is fairly dim,
though the candles against the wall have clearly been placed to afford
suitable illumination to those sitting in certain locations.  A few painted
landscapes hang from the smoothed stone walls, and a number of throw rugs
are spread about, adding colour to the area.  A bit of warmth emanates from
the crackling hearth to east, and to the south floods in light and laughter
from the common room.

Crackling flames dance peacefully within the stone fireplace set into the

wall above looms the trophied head of a sabre-toothed beast, with a small
golden plaque underneath proclaiming the name of the hunter that fell it. 
Upon the mantle are set other conversation pieces, including the long
spindling horn of a dragon.  An elegant woven rug is spread out in front of
the hearth, slightly worn from its time here in service, surrounded by
couches and chairs for those looking to enjoy the fire.

A Quiet Bookroom~
The musty smell of old paper permeates this small chamber, originating
from the many books which occupy the small stands of shelves lining the
room.  A large window is set into the eastern wall to catch the early
morning sun, and torches resting in elegant silver sconces accompany a
hanging iron chandelier set with candles to provide sufficient light for
comfortable reading at any hour.  The room is notably silent except for the
sounds occuring from within, providing a suitable environment for perusing
the collection.  A single rectangular table sits in the middle of room,
while multiple plush chairs are strewn about in an apparently random
fashion.  A single door leads out of the library to the north.

In The Garden~
Lush green grass covers the ground here, carefully tended and matted only
slightly by the traversal of many visitors.  A beautiful garden grows up
against the wall of the inn to the east, its length bursting with the
colours of a variety of different flowers and plants, and lending a sweet
fragrance to the surrounding area.  A small stone patio has been built
around the door leading back into the building to the south, upon which a
worn wooden rocking chair sits.  The garden continues to the north, and also
to the east, where a massive oak tree can be seen towering.

treeline to the north, seperating the area from the surrounding forest, and
a few slatted benches with fine metalworked ends are spread about.  A sense
of peace permeates this place as the gentle sounds of nature echo all
around, birds chirping and the winds rustling the leaves of the great trees.
The garden continues to the south and also to the east, where a small pond
ripples lightly.

Beside a Small Pond~
Clear blue water shimmers lightly, filling the circular pond which
dominates this area.  A few tall reeds break the surface of the natural
reservoir, and tiny creatures can be seen flitting about the scattered
lilypads.  Lush green grass covers the surroundings, bordered by an old
wooden fence which seperates it from the forest to the north and east.  A
couple of slatted benches with fine metalworked ends sit facing the water. 
A sense of peace permeates this place as the pond endlessly ripples, and the
sounds of birds chirping and trees rustling fill the air.  The inn and
garden lie to the west, and a great oak towers to the south.

Under a Great Oak~
Dark, verdant leaves fill the sky above you, growing from a massive oak
tree which towers into the air.  Lush green grass covers the ground,
becoming sparse near the base of the rounded trunk, cast in a permanent
shade from the foliage.  A sense of tranquility permeates this place as the
sounds of rustling leaves and chirping birds trickle down from within the
ancient branches.  An old wooden fence runs along the east and south,
seperating this area from the surrounding forest.  Nestled into the corner
stands a small stone marker, a single symbol engraved upon it.  The garden
continues to the west and also to the north, where a small pond ripples
lightly.

The Kitchen~
Counters and tables dominate this area, their surfaces covered in
partially prepared food, and unused portions.  Various utensils hang from
iron racks which are attached to the ceiling, and a large stone hearth in
the southern wall flares hotly, over which both a spit and a large cooking
pot are situated.  A small wood stove is set in the corner, with an oven
used for baking bread nearby.  The smells of the preparing foods mingle in
the air, creating a pleasurably enticing aroma.  The door to a pantry leads
out to the west, while a swinging door to the north leads into the main area
of the inn.

The Pantry~
A magical chill hangs in the air here, keeping cool the many foodstuffs
that line the walls and floor.  Large flanks of beast hang from metal hooks
on the ceiling, and hearty bags of flour and oats are heaped into the
corners.  Unmarked jars of powders and herbs rest on thin wooden shelves,
along with fresh-looking fruits and vegetables.  A small trapdoor is set
into the floor, and a doorway leads east, from beyond which the delightful
aroma of the kitchen can be smelt.

its frame worn with age, a large iron chest sitting at its foot.  A small
nightstand sits below a draped window set into the western wall, containing
one drawer and holding a few tattered books below.  Various tokens and
trinkets line a shelf built along the wall, running above the bed.  Painted
portraits hang on the northern wall of the room, a polished desk sitting
beside them.  A door opens to the east, leading out into the hallway.

deep red spread out beneath them.  A number of curiosities hang decoratively
on the walls, including a polished hunting sabre with a small gold engraving

sits facing the hearth, the distance dictated by a large white bearskin
splayed across the floor.  Against the southern wall, near the door leading
back into the hallway, is set a small dining table, a chair placed on either
side.  The gentle fragrence of roses fills the air, presumably emenating
from a few tiny golden urns set about the room.

ornate headboard.  Twin bedside tables sit on either side, a few small
candles scattered atop the surface of each.  At the end of the room, set
into the eastern wall, a large paned window allows a view of the garden
outside.  The glass along the edges has been crafted by a skilled hand,

oils and fragrances upon it.  A string hangs down above each of the baths,
running up to a tiny set of hanging bells.  A few clean white towels hang
off of bars affixed to the walls, below slightly ajar windows placed at even
intervals near the ceiling.  The only visible exit is a door set into the
