the Eldest~
The ancient caladaran steward of the Hall of Learning stands here.
~
Ancient by even the standards of the caladaran race, the steward of the
Hall of Learning is known merely as the Eldest, his true name long since
forgotten.  His skin is brittle and deeply furrowed like that of an elder
oak and bristly white hair forms a short beard on his chin.  His body is
hidden in the voluminous robes of his office.  In spite of his weakening
frame his mind is still clear and wise.  As the oldest living resident of
the village, he serves as both leader and teacher to the Jandiska and those
who come to them seeking wisdom.

say Intent figures greatly into the goodly interpretations of Justice.
say In more neutral visions, such as that of Iandir it is not intent but actions that determine justice\@s course.
say The Law of Iandir cares not why, but that it happened.
say The justice of the dark gods is a twisted and sinister thing.
say More often than not it is a system of punishments for failing your foul masters. Obedience with tolerance. Failure with death.
say But, at it\@s heart, justice is the proper course cause and effect.

say This remove from the battles of ethics and beliefs keeps them fighting themselves.
say And allows them to act as diplomats, if need be.
say However, their lack of care for the nature of what they uncover can lead to danger.
say As they reveal discoveries of the demonic nature along with knowledge more goodly and benign.
say The followers of Enaerai, however, seek to balance the world into neutrality.
say Often through force of arms.
say Rather than remove themselves from these battles, they throw themselves into them with abandon, taking the side of the weakest.
say By consequence, they have few allies, many foes and are often on the less powerful side.

say A virtue, it seems, ill understood in these realms.
say But sparing the pain of another is a noble act, be that the agony of hunger, word or blade.
say This is a form of generosity linked to Selflessness and with similar pitfalls.
say For there are those who would take advantage of your mercy, and indeed attempt to strike you down for it.
say A wise man will recognize mercy when it is granted, however, for it is a precious gift.
say And it would behoove such a person to be thankful and take time to understand why they were spared.
say When we grant mercy, we are sparing a person from losing something they hold dear.
say And be it coin, life or prestige, they should realize how close they came to losing their treasure.
say There are those who are too dim to understand, however, and those who are so full of pride they will not accept mercy.
say You must act with wisdom when these times arrive, and with Justice.

say That to live by the dictates of another creates a sickness in the soul.
say They oppose the organization of goodly orders benignly, but the tyranny of darkness incurs their violent wrath.
say The follows of Girihka, merely believe in the destruction of all orderly civilizations and return to nature.
say And the followers of Tzajai, what they believe changes with wind and whim.
say The most dangerous are the dark forces of chaos. Sythrak\@s get with their savage barbarian rule.
say And the anti-creationism of Bayyal, a being of hate and fire representing all that breaks down without building up.

say It is this willingness to bring someone low to raise yourself higher that marks this virtue as a sinister one.

say The followers black gods exult in the elevation of the self at the loss of others.
say While those same gods raise themselves at the expense of their followers.
say The road of selfishness is lonely, as being able to care only for oneself deadens you to the needs of others.

say To concern yourself the well-being of others is the nature of goodness.
say The gods of light, Jolinn and Alajail chief among them, expect this of their followers.
say And the institutions of goodness expect it as well.
say You must temper your generosity with wisdom, however, for there are those who would take advantage of it.

say I speak of knowing your limits this day. There is wisdom to understanding when you are overmatched.
say For you see, the weak man flees from the assault of a warrior not because he is a coward, but because he is wise.
say It is important to consider those who depend on you when taking on a challenge.
say And to think on the consequences of your actions.
say There are those, of course, who answer every challenge with cowardice.
say From shrinking theives to the feckless followers of Serachel, one must be prepared for their evasion in all its forms.

say The followers of the martial gods, Dolgrael and his sort, regard it highly for its value on a field of conflict.
say But even the gods and goddesses of peace require courage from their followers to walk down their dangerous path.
say Unrealized by many, true courage requires wisdom.
say An ignorant man facing a threat he does not understand nor cares to is not brave, but foolish.

Assawi presides over the druidic grove of Jandiska Village, protecting it
and the surrounding village.  A caladaran in the prime of life, Assawi\@s
barklike skin is a rich mahogany and her pale brown hair falls in strands
around her vibrant face.  She seems to draw strength from the life of the
forest as she wanders her grove, smiling to herself.  She has become

say Just as life, death is part of the natural way of things.

say The tales of Gogoth, the Lich King. Mages with lives extended by magics. All these profane the natural world.

his retirement.  Before attaining this station he aided in conflicts against
the forces of chaos all across Avendar, eventually earning the blessings of
Iandir himself.  Barija is now in his middle years but still possesses much
of his arcane might.  There has been little call to use it, however, in this

~
This old caladaran tends the nearby cemetary, his features wizened and
his limbs gnarled by the march of years.  A scraggly beard grows from his
chin, and his hair is wild and ill-kept.  His eyes are large and bright,
flashing almost wildy in the lamplight.  When not sitting, he leans heavily
on a cane almost as gnarled and old as he is.

The statues are of three caladaran each facing out with their backs to
one another.  

Facing north, toward the Hall of Learning, is the figure of a robed
caladaran man carved from mountain granite.  He faces directly forward to
the Hall, as if gazing upon the collected knowledge therein and he holds in
his left hand an hourglass and in his other a book.  At his feet the words
\#Chadraln, the Seer\# are carved into a plaque.  

Facing southeast is the stone carved the figure of a woman dressed in simple
monastic robes.  From her right hand dangles a balance scale, formed of
weathered bronze, and in the upturned palm of the other melts a single
snowflake.  She looks downward in contemplation, her expression abstracted. 
At her feet lies a plaque, graven with the letters, \#Jalassa, the Arbiter of
Enlightenment\#.  

Facing southwest is a much smaller statue of a young caladaran girl, face
turned upward to drink in the sun.  Good cheer lights up her face as she
holds up a lily carved of white marble in her left hand.  A basket
overflowing with a myriad of other flowers dangles from her right.  The
plaque at her feet is engraved with the words, \#Alajial, Blossom of
Serenity\#.

You recognize this to be the amulet of Barana, a long-dead scholar.  He

a tongue for prophecy.  If these gifts were because of this amulet, or
created with those gifts, is also a matter of debate.  The necklace was

For as long as caladaran have been known, they have served as teachers
and healers, though seldom as warriors or men of the sword.  Preferring a
solitary lifestyle, they will nevertheless live in cities or towns if it
suits their purposes (their healers in particular). 
  
Among themselves, the caladarans have a council of sages, which meets
infrequently and typically only over matters of grave importance, preferring
to let local rulers and laws deal with day to day problems.

{WTHE CALADARAN{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
The caladaran are a peaceful people, given to contemplation of the ways
and nature of Avendar.  Tall and thin, with a stoney, bark-like skin, the
bodies of caladaran resemble walking sticks.  Their faces are more
humanoid,with most caladaran showing little signs of age for most of their
life.
  
Caladaran first appear in human records shortly before the formal
beginning of the Republic of Earendam.  First noted as wanderers from the
east and south, the caladaran brought with them the magics of earth, though
they also rapidly took to the healing arts which had so dominated following
the War of Fire.  The caladaran also brought with them the worship of
Iandir, who embodied the principles most of the caladaran lived by. 
Previously worshipped only as a noncorporeal force, the devotion to order
and Law became a religion among some humans, giving rise to the first
codified set of laws (laid down by the nobles of the aelin Ipsoli line) as
well as the written script used as the basis for the common tongue today.

interaction of endless interest and signifigance.
To this end, I have compiled the thoughts of the
many peoples of Avendar on those they share this
realm with.
~
E
volume2~
Volume 7- The Caladaran, by Astiljisi, Scholar of Spirit and Advisor to
                 Rhentil, Secretary of Danrasad
  
The Aelin:
The aelin are a proud race, but not too proud to seek our advice in
matters of import.  It is in this manner we may curb their natural excesses.
We must wield their power subtly, as not to arouse their awareness of it. 
Should an aelin believe he is being led to an idea that is not of his own
\@flawless\@ devising, his stubborn pride will not allow him to embrace it. 
No matter how wise the idea may be.  
  
The Alatharya:
The brutish alatharya exercise their might with a single-minded lack of
vision.  For us, this is a double-edged sword in our dealings with them.  As
allies, they are often oblivious to our subtle coaching.  There is simply no
way to conspire with one due to their singular lack of guile.  As foes, they
may not detect our hand in events, no matter how obvious.  When the weapons
are loosed, however, it is better to have them on your side, but a good
distance away.  They swing wild.
~
E
volume3~
The Chaja:
If the alatharya exercise their might without vision, the chaja do so
without mercy.  They are better manipulated from afar or avoided altogether.
Such physical might coupled with a vicious temperament make them unsafe
company.  Those that serve their shuddeni masters still are angry at their
bondage.  Those that have escaped are angry at once being bound, and those
born free are merely angry.  
  
The Ch\@taren:
The ch\@taren live their lives at the manic pace suiting one of the
shortest-lived races.  It may not be out of the question for me to witness
many generations of one of these golden-skinned families in the course of my
life.  They are erratic but well-meaning, a few zealously so.  Their chaotic
nature makes them difficult to work with.  They lack patience or a
willingness to take a long view of a conflict.  Fortunately they also lack
malice, which makes many of their other qualities more tolerable.  
  
The Ethron:
No other race is so akin to us, yet so different as the hearty and
sagacious ethron.  Physically, we are opposites.  They are short, stout and
solid while we are taller and of a more scholarly making.  But we share a
wisdom and appreciation for the wilds of Avendar that transcends our obvious
differences.  Even those of us who reside in a city often feel the tug for
the solitude of the forest.  Many an ethron village has a caladaran advisor
residing in the nearby woods.
~
E
volume4~
The Humans:
Humans, taken as a race, are unpredictable and fickle.  Taken
individually, once you understand their goals, they can be influenced as any
other might be.  They wax in power as a race and it would be best for all
that they are well-advised on how to use this newfound influence.  It would
not do for it to be wielded at the expense of order and peace.  
  
The Kankoran:
The Kankoran share our affinity for the wild places of Avendar, but as a
race they oppose ordered societies on principle.  Many of our less involved
brethren live amongst them unmolested, but those of us who guard the Laws
of Iandir that our people brought to Avendar often find ourselves matching
our spells with their blades.  It is an unfortunate state of affairs, but
neither side will yield in this seemingly endless conflict.  
  
The Nefortu:
It is best to exercise the wisdom of Iandir when dealing with the
Nefortu.  Deception is bred in their bones, but vision is infused into ours.
With sound judgement we may sift the truth from the words of a nefortu as a
Ryarl panner may sift gold from mere dross.  In the civil courts of the land
we must work quietly to reign in their devious schemes.  It is well for
Avendar\@s cities we are so vigilant.
~
E
volume5~
The Shuddeni:
The shuddeni represent an intellect to rival that of our kind.  While we
seek harmony, however, they seek domination.  Their bent is malevolent and
martial.  Theirs is a will to take and to possess.  In civilized lands we
must work against their overtures to gain a measure of authority in
Avendar\@s cities.  In the wilds, we must defend our homes against their
malevolent sorcery and chaja slaves.  Nothing of lasting good comes of a
relationship with a shuddeni.  Keep that in mind during your dealings with
them.  
  
The Srryn:
The srryn are a vicious, but conflicted race.  One branch of their
lineage lurks in the fetid swamps of Avendar, seeking to bring death and
destruction to all other races and their civilizations.  Yet, there are
those who separate themselves from their savage brethren and take up lives
within the cities, and some even protecting the Laws of Iandir that define
them.  It is fortunate that the these two disparate cultures are easily
discerned from one another.

Or perhaps it the deaths of many that causes anguish enough to leave a
scar in the very fabric of being?  The deaths at the great battle of Nordath
may be caused by such, although the truth is not known.  Perhaps some great
war, long forgotten, took place in the fens to cause it to become such a
place of spiritual rot.  

Only investigation and divination will yield the truest answers in the
fullness of time.  Eventually the old ghosts of Avendar may yet rest and the
tulmult of cursed magic may ebb and fade.  For now it appears that such will
not be the case for decades to come, however.

Cursed and Haunted Avendar

The mystical scars that mark the land of Avendar are many.  Since the
Sundering conflict and magic have swept over the lands and the pain of their
passing has left an unshakeable blight.  

Are such places the work of the Dragon, whose true name I shall not write? 
The stench of black sorcery hangs heavy over such places.  Was Gogoth\@s fall
not the result of a pact with dark powers, perhaps the Dragon himself?  Were
the people of Shendaer cursed by demonic powers?  If this is true, perhaps
these places reflect where the unholy has dragged its claws over our world. 
The first wounds inflicted by a creature intent of finishing its fell task.

A Faint Mountain Path~
This faint mountain path climbs its way steadily to the north across an
open granite face.  Moss and lichen speckle the worn rock, the path only
distinguishable from the surrounding terrain by the barest of depressions in
the stone.  A few small stacks of piled stones help to mark the way.  To the
south, the path descends into a grove of hardy mountain trees, and continues
across the open rock face to the north.  The air is thin and cool.  The
Mlejian mountains rise all about you, brown, lifeless peaks and crags
spreading away in a harsh but beautiful vista.

A Faint Mountain Path~

An Ascending Mountain Path~
This narrow mountain path climbs its way across a rugged rock face which
grows increasingly more broken to the north and east.  The jagged brown rock
becomes smoother to the west.  A massive protrusion of rock juts out from
the mountainside which rises to the east, a dim space showing beneath.  The
trail vanishes among the rocks to the north, winding and twisting to pass
between the many boulders and other obstacles which are strewn through this
mountain pass.  Moss and lichens are spread sparsely about the stone.  The
air is thin and cool.

Beneath a Large Outcropping~
A jagged rock outcropping above covers this side path in comfortable

near the base of the overhang where an animal seems to have worn a smooth
depression into the stone.  Scattered skeletons of smaller animals suggest
this is the lair of some sort of predator.  A path can be seen winding up

A Winding Mountain Trail Among the Rocks~
This narrow mountain trail wends its way through the large boulders and
rock formations which are strewn through this mountain pass.  The mountain
walls curve into steep ascents not far off the path to the east and west,
towering overhead.  The path vanishes among the brown rocks to the south. 
To the north, the pass appears to end in an abrupt overlook.  Sparse spots
of lichen and moss dot the stone about you, though no other vegetation is
visible in the harsh mountain environment.  The air is thin and cool.

Overlooking the Valley of the Jandiska~
This ledge juts out of the brown stone of the mountain, overlooking a
narrow valley.  The valley\@s green forests make a vibrant slash of color in
the otherwise overwhelmingly drab, stark landscape, mountain peaks and crags
and unnavigable chasms lining the horizon as far as the eye can see.  A
small trail winds its way down the cliff face into the valley and heading
into the forest below.  To the south it is swiftly swallowed up by the many
large boulders and rocks strewn through the pass.  Steep mountainsides flank
the pass, which seems to continue for some distance.

A Trail Through the Pine Forest~
This forest valley is filled with tall, mature pine trees.  Brown
mountain peaks are barely visible through the foliage, encircling the
valley.  The soil is thick and loamy, coated in a carpet of dead needles.  A
small clearing opens up to the north.  Small trails lead through the pine

A Modest Encampment~
This forest valley is filled with tall, mature pine trees.  Brown
mountain peaks are barely visible through the foliage, encircling the
valley.  The soil is thick and loamy, coated in a carpet of dead needles.  A
simple encampment has been made here - a small firepit smolders away, and
several hammocks have been slung in the sheltering boughs of a particularly
large fir.  A clothesline bears a few disconsolate rags, hung out to dry. 
Small trails lead through the pine trees to the south and east, and a
broader path to the west passes through thick underbrush into an open
clearing.

A Natural Pavilion~
This clearing in the forest appears to be the result of many decades of
careful husbandry.  A rectangular space is free of trees, bordered in a neat
row of young pines.  Their branches have been masterfully woven together in
a sort of topiary wall, forming an impenetrable, natural hedge.  At the
corners of the clearing, four massive poplars rise above the young pines,
four large branches reaching for the center of the open space.  Among these
stately rafters a living ceiling of thick grapevine has been woven, the
growth thick and verdant.  The ground beneath is covered in a rich growth of
springy moss, soft and comfortable.  A natural outcropping of stone sits at
the back end of the pavilion.  To the east, an opening in the hedge leads
down a short path into the pine forest.

A soft carpet of grass covers the earth on the outskirts of Jandiska
Village.  The entrance to the humble settlement lies on the northern end of
this clearing; little more than a break in the trees that densely surround
the village like a living wall.  A few tents and campsites have been set up
on the green by visitors to the village and the smell of cookfires lingers
in the mountain air.  To the southwest a path leads down into rougher

Trees spring up alongside this well worn path through the village and
further down the way humble homes constructed of wood and stone can be seen.
Off the path to the west, near the break in the trees that allows entrance
into Jandiska, stands an inn, a sign hanging by its open door.  With its
smoking stone chimney and the hint of firelight dancing through its thick
windows, its draw to a weary traveler is great.  Southwards a break in the
trees leads out of the village, while the opposite direction leads toward

A small inn for travelers, the Scholar\@s Rest serves as a place for the
road weary to eat and rest.  The sturdy stone and timber construction of the
inn and its large hearth keep the interior comfortably warm, almost cozy. 
Behind the counter a modest selection of kegs serve as the inn\@s bar.  Also
behind the bar counter shallow kitchen is visible, the smells of cooking
emerging from it.  A hearth with a roaring fire has tables and chairs
gathered near it toward the north end of the room.  Through a door to the
west the common quarters for boarders can be seen.  The eastern door leads

building in Jandiska, stands on the north end of the square.  Its stone
facade rises two stories into the trees, and a small bell tower climbs yet
higher from its roof.  A grove of trees sprouts west of the square, and a

A Forested Village Path~
Trees spring up alongside this well worn path through the village.  The
dirt road here turns into stone cobbles to the west as it approaches the
center of Jandiska.  Humble wood and stone homes line the path, doors

The Gravekeeper\@s Cottage~
Charms and totems hang over the doors and windows of this humble cottage.
Bunches of dried herbs hang from the wooden ceiling, filling the home with a
pungent, spicy odor that doesn\@t quite mask the smell of grave earth that
has settled into the bones of the house.  Old digging tools litter the

A Hardy Pine Forest~
This forest is comprised of scrawny, hardy pine trees.  The bent,
scraggly trees cling to the nearly-bare brown stone of the valley floor,
gnarled roots twining down in competition for the scant soil.  A trail
passes through, forking in three directions; to the south, it climbs out of
the tree cover and zigzags up a short cliff face.  To the north and east it
enters the deeper forest, the trees becoming larger and more healthy as the
valley deepens.

and weed-choked from neglect and a low, clinging mist seems to linger about

The skeleton of what was once a temple looms all around you.  The

holding up nothing but stale air.  The stones at your feet are now

souls resting beneath the slabs set into the floor.  The large, empty
archway in which the temple door once stood leads to the graveyard to the
