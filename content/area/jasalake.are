Lahcik~
Lahcik lounges about lazily, enjoying the stompitude.
~
Lahcik is a smallish nefortu with dark fur and slit-like eyes.  He grasps
a cleaver in one hand and a long, thin knife in the other.  His wings beat
feverishly as he awaits new arrivals of fish.

A mallard is here.

This duck looks to be of the mallard variety, judging by the markings on
its head and wings.  Its dark feathers on its body are set off in marked
contrast by the bright green of their head-feathers, giving them a camouflaged
appearance.

the Jiast\@Ja~
A gigantic fish is here, swimming about irritably.
~
This huge fish appears to be a relic of an age gone by.  Its brown scales
are nearly the size of dinner plates, giving the aquatic beast a heavily
armored appearance.  Its head, nearly an extension of its powerful body, is
plated with a solid piece of scaled armor, from which two golden eyes peer
angrily.  Its oversized maw is lined with row upon row of large, jagged
teeth.  Five fins line its body, which culminates in a powerful propelling
fin.

brown hair, tied sloppily into a bun behind her head, belies the fact that
she hasn\@t gotten nearly enough sleep lately.  She wears a plain brown robe
which is fraying near the hem and dirtied in spots, which clings to her body
as if she has been wearing it for days.  Almost always alone in the small

Hanel~
A man is here, looking generally irritated.

This young husband\@s skin is reddened from days out in the sun.  Hanel\@s
average-looking face with its ice blue eyes and rather large nose, is framed
by a mass of rather unkempt strawberry blonde hair.  His expression seems to
have sunken itself into his face, making him look a bit older than he
actually is.

A thick cloud of mosquitoes hovers over the standing waters.  Alone, each
small brown insect is only slightly larger than an annoying gnat, yet
together, they seem to conspire to block your view of the reeds beyond.  The
cloud remains rather stationary, except when disturbed by breathing beings,
to which they seem to gravitate.

A thin ethron woman walks gingerly around her house, attempting to keep it balanced.

This thin ethron woman seems very concerned about the state of her house.
Despite the fact that it is obviously quite precariously balanced, she seems
to have taken great pains to keep things as straight as possible.  Her
nervousness and the speed of her movements seem to be the source of her
thinness.  Her skin is rather a rather dark green color, and her long brown
hair is pulled into a neat braid which hangs down her back.

she seems almost averse to the machinations of magic, and simply prefers not
to use it.  Physically, she is quite tall, and two peaceful green eyes stare
out from the barklike skin of her face.  Her thin figure, however, remains
obscured beneath a wide brown robe, which is held together with the clasp of
a leaf.

This human woman is bound by thick chains to the stone wall.  Her head
hangs low and her matted hair covers her face, while her arms hang limp
against their restraints.  She is covered in dirt and blood, in spots, and
is naked except for the remains of a flimsy white skirt around her waist.

This woman is nearly naked, clad only in a flimsy torn skirt, but her
face is one of a person who has just had a great weight lifted from her
shoulders.  There are bags under her eyes, which glimmer brightly with hope.
A relieved smile dances on her full yet scarred lips.  Scars and bruises
crisscross her body, one particularly bad one across her chest in the shape
of a pentagram, but none of them seem to bother her.  
~
>data_prog brasysisbroken~
Dark circles have formed around this woman\@s eyes.  Her hair hangs lank
across her shoulders, and a wicked grin tugs at her supple lips.  She is
mostly naked, save a torn skirt around her waist.  Her skin is covered in
scars, scabs, bruises, and marks, most of which look quite recent.  Her
nails are black, blue, and red, evincing some form of torture.  One
particularly large scar is on her chest, in the form of a full pentagram,
which seems to be filled with some black material that pulses faintly.

Married only a few months ago, Elisza and Hanel were the picture-perfect
couple; young, idealistic, and full of energy.  They moved to the small
Jaras community into its least expensive house in the hopes that they could
make their fortune there, and later move to Var Bandor or Earendam, where
there was far much more action during the days and nights.  Elisza changed
shortly after their move, however, and began being annoying and refusing to
do housework.  She changed her mindset on children, which had previously
been positive, to one which was strictly against them.  At the same time,
she refused to allow Hanel to leave their apartment, and thus tensions
between them grow.

of his motivation, however, when he realized just how lazy the small Jaras
community was.  Being not much of an outdoorsman, he became restless in the
village, and refused to leave the apartment to try to find a job, despite
his protestations to the contrary.  This, combined with Elisza\@s sudden
change of heart on the subject of having children, has helped to turn Hanel

a brown cloak with a leaf-shaped clasp~
A thick brown cloak lies here, a leaf-shaped clasp near its neckline.~
Set to study in the Tower of Salyra at a young age, Rehaeda was very much
at the bottom of her class.  Unable to do much other than simple cures, she
became quite embarrassed when the pupils in her class surpassed her
knowledge of the healing arts quite handily.  One evening, she snuck out of
the Tower and fled from her studies.  Running toward the direction of her
home in Var Bandor, she realized that she would be shunned by her parents if
she were to return a failure.  Instead of returning to immediate defeat,
Rehaeda chose to enter the woods of Nendor.  Tired, hungry, and afraid, she
stumbled upon the guild of the Druids.  The guard took pity on her and
allowed her in, giving her a bed of leaves to rest in, and some herbal tea. 
The next morning when she awoke, Rehaeda found that she felt more alive than
ever in her bed of leaves, and pleaded with Inelion Lobern to allow her to
study under him.  

Months followed, and Rehaeda\@s innate knowledge of herbal lore became highly
evident.  Once she had been named a mistress of herbs, she returned to her
family, intent on telling them her good news.  Instead of rejoicing,
however, they sent her away, claiming that she was a disgrace to all they
had ever known.  She left the city in tears and followed the Aragol river to
its source, past her beloved forest of Nendor.  There, she came upon Jasa
Lake and the small Jaras community.  Realizing that many men had been burned
by the sun and were prone to being attacked by raids of angry srryn or the
fish known as the Jiast\@ja, she took it upon herself to be the curatress of
the village.  She wove this cloak out of specially-found vines, and claimed
it to be her protection from the magics and harm of the land.  She wore
this, combined with a modified signet pendant she had found in Salyra as a
child, as the symbols of her past and future.

somewhat of a symbol of her failure in youth.  Once she moved into the

pair intricately-styled intricately styled leather boots black soles sole~
a pair of intricately-styled leather boots~
A pair of intricately-styled leather boots lie here, black soles softly gleaming.~
This pair of boots was said to have been carved by the hands of the Gods
themselves.  While this claim has for many many years remained
unsubstantiated, so they added to the small fame of the House of Aeisthis of
Gaald.  

Fateful was the day when Ilarilen Aeisthis, head of the House, handed these
boots to his eldest son as he headed to the School of Heroes.  The original
plan was that Ilresael, the son, were to enter the School, train his skill
in the high art of Swordmastery and to use his skills if the blade and the
political power of his father to overthrow Tanar, the Duke of Gaald, and
place the house of Aeisthis in power of the port town.  Sadly for Ilresael,
even the best-laid plans may have unforseen circumstances, which was what
befell him when he headed down the Aragol River to Jasa Lake to gloat his
superiority over the citizens of the village.  He wandered into the
village\@s house of Healing and began spewing spiteful phrases toward Rehaeda
and laughing at her lack of wealth.  Angered by the youth\@s insolence,
Rehaeda told him she would show him the greatest secret to her herbal arts,
and a way to increase his own wealth if he were to deal with it correctly. 


She lead him along the shore of the lake to a small pile of roots.  While
she knew what lay beneath, the youth was entirely oblivious, having spent
more of his study-time boasting about his family than learning the bestiary
of the world.  Rehaeda beckoned to Ilresael to take the roots, promising him
endless fortune if he were to take them.  As his hand clasped the roots, the
sjasis-beast leapt from the sand and began mauling the young adventurer with
its sharp teeth.  Rehaeda threw up a wall of thorns about the fighting pair,
keeping the youth from fleeing to safety.  After a few short moments,
Ilresael was dead, and Rehaeda and the sjasis stood above his corpse.  

With a wordless wave of her hand, Rehaeda offered the boots to the sjasis,
not knowing of their tale.  The beast greedily took the boots and wore them,
laughing shrilly in a mockery of the symbols which were inscribed thereupon.
After a short gloat, the beast lept upon the teen\@s corpse, rending flesh
from bone with alarming speed as Rehaeda returned to her home with a feeling
of accomplishment.  The House of Aeisthis remained uninformed on the issue
and assumed that their son had met some valiant end in slaying a dragon or
some equally foul beast.  Rehaeda all but forgot about the mouthy teen, whom
she deemed more worthy of death than the braggardlieness which he
exemplified so readily in her own home.  The sjasis kept the boots, enjoying
the way they felt on his feet, until he finally met his end.

The thick leather of these boots has been carved with master precision. 
A depiction of a warring pair of dragons is on the left heel, while a
beautifully drawn holy symbol of Jolinn is on the right.  The figures of the
dragons, while still in the grain of the boot, appear to shift and battle as
you look at them, their tails winding about each other and reaching from the
heel to the toe.  The symbol of Jolinn mirrors only that which can be seen
in His shrine in Earendam.  While the symbol itself remains uncoloured, its
surface seems to shimmer with a bluish sheen as you examine it.  The soles
of the boot are made of similar leather and are polished to a mirror-like
sheen.  The boots are held onto the feet by clasps of dirty gold, carved
with intricate minutiae of a winding vine while a few golden flowers attach
the strap to the buckle.

first~
{W***The Essence of Balance***{x

The term \@Balance\@, particularly as it relates to the Knights of Enaerai,
has been at times misunderstood.  One of the most common misconceptions of
this ideal semms to be the thought that there can nothing extreme in one\@s
life.  That somehow, all colors must be grey, all actions minimal and
mundane, all food bland, all excitement contained.  But such a lifestyle
would be unnecessarily unfulfilling.  No, the key to understanding what is
truly meant by Balance is to realize that for any phenomena, there is, or
should be, a counter-phenomena.  That is, if one side of the spectrum of
etremities is experienced, so should the other, in its turn.  Practically
speaking, this translates into the coexistance of, for example, good and
evil.  Or perhaps order and disorder.  

To understand this further, consider the analogue of a board of wood evenly
levelled atop a small rock.  When there is naught upon the board, it is
balanced.  However, it serves no purpose.  This is analogous to the world
ere it was populated with life - balanced, yet unfulfilled.  If an object of
uniform shape and weight is placed in the exact center of the board, the
setup will remain balanced.  For the sake of the analogy, assume that no
further objects can be placed atop this one, that is, that none of these are
stackable.  In that case, the board is level (and therefore acceptable), but
the system still has not achieved its full potential, as there remains a
great length of unladen board.  This is similar to the lifestyle described
in the beginning, that of blandness and relative inaction.  Indeed, it can
even be easily argued that such a way of life is inherently unbalanced in
and of itself, but that is not the point of this present explanation.  The
board has not reached its full potential until its entire length is covered,
in the middle and at both extremes.  And behold, that though there exist
objects at the extremities of the board - analogously, at the extremities of
life - the board remains level and balanced.  That is what is meant by
\@Balance\@: not the absence of extremes, but rather their equilibrium.  
~
E
second~
{W***The Necessity of Balance***{x

Having defined what is actually meant by Balance, the natural
question that arises is \#Why should this Balance be upheld?\#.  At 
the simplest level, the answer to this is that it is the natural 
way.  Evidence of this can be found all throughout nature - in the
daily interchange of sun and moons, in the lives and deaths of all
living creatures, in the cycle of seasons.  Even in the fascinating 
interplay of water and fire - the former will quench the latter,
but in the process neutralize itself into vapor - can this concept
of balance be found.  The original Three of the Pantheon, with or
without realizing it, created the world this way.

And example may be taken from those very Three.  One of the
light, one of the darkness, one of neither persuasion: in all, 
perfect balance.  At first glance, this may seem defeated by the
fact that each followed an orderly way.  But a slightly deeper 
understanding of the matter reveals that this is necessary, for 
balance to be acheived.  After all, before the form and order they
created, there was only chaos.  Their very lawfulness balanced this
disarray, and neatly completes the example.

Many reject the necessity of Balance, choosing instead to seek
personal gain. This reveals, however, the narrowness of their
scope.  For to defy the natural way is to place oneself at risk.
If excessive, nature itself will rebuke the imbalance.  This very
instance was exemplified in the raising up of the Goddess Girikha,
to offset the rigid control of the law.  Thus, ignoring or
attempting to overpower Balance for personal gain is an act doomed
to fail, unless somehow that force is stronger than nature itself
(and by extension, the might of all Three combined).

This section continues on the third page.
~
E
third~
There are those who, possessed of a more altruistic outlook,
cannot conceive of the need for Balance because it permits, even 
requires, darkness and evil.  This idea is intrinsically flawed.
Consider a world where there was no such thing as \@poor\@.  Every
inhabitant of this world must have the same number and quality of
possession as every other.  If this were not true, there would be
some sort of difference of degree in wealth, and whichever had less
would be deemed \@poor\@, even if they were by our standards 
fabulously wealthy.  This is true because titles like \@rich\@ and 
\@poor\@ are utterly relative to one another.  Yet, even if the case
where each denizen had the exact same as every other were true, 
none of them could be called \@rich\@  Not poor, but not rich either.
In the same way, \@good\@ and \@evil\@ are relative descriptors.  If 
there was no darkness, no evil, in the lands, then there could be 
no good, nor any light.  And how can someone who claims to seek
good actively choose a world in which there was no good or light?
And so their argument fails.

With just what has so far been presented, one might perceive
Balance as a necessary burden to carry, a chore that must be
performed.  In truth, it is a glorious thing, a gift granted to us
all, not a punishment.  But, one might argue, Balance dictates that
if you experience joy and pleasure, you must also at some point
experience pain.  How can that be a gift?


He who seeks an understanding of such an apparent paradox should
refrain from taking food or drink of any kind for an extended
period of time, until his mouth is parched and his stomache has
long since ceased rumbling from hunger.  After the time has passed,
he should partake of a simple meal, perhaps some Nendorian cakes
and water.  Provided the length of his fast was ample, the joy he 
feels, and the pleasure of relief in such a meagre banquet, is far
greater than he would have felt with a sumptuous array had he not
abstained.  The point of this is to understand the function of pain
and sacrifice - these things enhance the experiences of joy and
pleasure.  They bring focus into our lives.  And then a
comprehension of the gift of Balance is easy to grasp.  Balance is
that which takes our joys and makes them truly joyful, and our
pains and makes them truly painful.  In truth, it is that which
expands the sensation of life itself, for no life is without any
joy or any pain.  And in that, Balance is a great gift to us all.
~
E

{W***The Responsibility of the Knights of Idris***{x

Alas, despite the clear need for Balance, so many refuse to
accept it.  In most cases, this is not an active opposition to the
idea, rather, most prevalent is an apathy or lack of exposure to
it.  Therefore, the Knights of Enaerai seek to correct this.  There
are many differing methods for this, among them, simple teaching
and spreading of the ideas, to convince others of the need.
Failing this, some may be convinced to act as needed for the
Balance by making it not worth their while to refuse.  And
sometimes, though this need not be a last resort, direct violence
is required.  However the case may be, the overarching goal and
function of every Knight is to work towards maintaining the
balance.

The role the Idris branch plays in this is threefold.  Firstly,
it is the responsibility and function of Idris to consider,
develop, and spread the concept of Balance in all of its
manifestations.  This is done, of course, according to the
teachings of the Great Lady Enaerai, whom every Knight pledges to
serve at their induction.  Secondly, Knights of Idris should keep
information on adventurers, insofar as it pertains to their outlook
on life.  Ideally, this information is largely supplied by the Mett
branch.  The purpose of this is to provide an outlet for correcting
the balance when the Scales of Orlin lean overmuch.  The more that
is known, the more readily action may be taken.

This section continues on the fifth and final page.
~
E
fifth~
Finally, members of Idris may be called upon to fight.  It is
the responsibility of every Knight to be willing and able to do
this.  And, indeed, those of Idris should go into battle before
those of Mett are required to do so, for it is imperative that
Knights of Mett maintain their secrecy, lest their future
usefulness to the cause of Balance be reduced.  If it is necessary
for those of Idris to battle, all efforts should be made to secure
documents away safely prior to the fight.  Otherwise, much work may
be lost, or perhaps even captured and capitalized upon.  Clearly,
this is not a desirable outcome.

It is an honor to be a Knight of Enaerai.  To be among those
chosen to uphold the Balance that is so essential to these lands.
May Enaerai bless us all, and may her Eye ever gaze upon us with
favor.

A rough, heavily-woven strip of homespun cloth, perhaps bjorcha-wool, is

deep, royal blue, surrounded by a plaid pattern of bright red, forest green,
ochre, and hints of black.  Extra yarns, added later, it seems, compliment
and elaborate the original pattern, almost as if telling a story in some
primitive, tribal manner.  Overall, the bright, garish threads,
dichotomously discordant yet complimentary, blend well with each other, the
weave strong and symbolic.  A brighter slash of ochre, almost a yellow,
zigzags crazily down the length of the central blue stripe.  Three heavy bone
pins, slightly curved, are pushed through the coarse weave.  Bloodstained,
they each bear a burnt-in \@X\@ on the wider end.

chunk blackened stone pulsing~
a chunk of blackened stone~
A chunk of blackened stone lies here, pulsing faintly.~
This stone is Juvmakian Basalt, a type that generally is only found quite
far beneath the surface.  This particular chunk appears to be from a much
larger stone or set of stones.  The runic markings on it are of a type long
forgotten, but are quite similar to arcane writings of the ancient
alatharya.  

The pulsing of the runes seems random at first, but as you study them
closer, you feel almost viscerally the message they communicate --
\#iruthariyukz.\#  Holding this stone and pronouncing in a place of power will
transport its holder to another location.

The Headwaters of the Aragol~
Rocks and stones are visible through the clear waters of the lake beneath
you, which mark the beginning of the Aragol River to the north.  Jasa Lake
yawns before you to the south and east, its still surface rippling softly at
the breeze and reflecting the clouds, sun, and moon as they pass by.  The
rocks beneath the surface of the lake cause the beginning of the river to
gurgle merrily, and a few fish are visible darting about in the shallows.  A
small, sandy beach marks off the lake to the west, and is followed by a line
of trees.

here, for the crystal clear water seems to be no more than five inches deep.
Flies and Waterstriders buzz about the area, making the leaves and water
surface feel very much alive.  A thin line of beach heads northward,

A small beach is here, its thick brown sand almost entirely saturated

sunk into the wet sand, here, forming tiny lakes of their own.  The beach
itself is low-lying, only barely venturing above the level of water within

A few amphibious trees grow from the ground here, their mud-caked roots
holding the trunk of the tree high above the level of the ground.  They have
grown rather towering due to lack of competition for sun and nutrients and
thus nearly obscure the sky from view, their thick, flat leaves rustling
gently in the breeze.  A few animals have made their homes within the thick
roots of the tree.  Without a view to the sun, the ground below is
perpetually damp and is covered with a carpet-like layer of grass.  The
ground becomes less grassy and becomes muddy and damp to the south and east,

where trees do not rise.  Two more trees stand to the west, over the

Through the window, it is obvious that the interior of the cabin is mostly

On a Small Pier~
A small wooden pier is here, lined with metal anchors to which small
fishing boats may be tied.  The wood of the pier is covered with a thin
layer of slime which is marked only by the lines created by the dragging of
filled fishing nets.  A platform which casts the water in perpetual shadow
is about twenty feet above the surface of the water, supported by the wooden
pillars which rise from the water to the east and west.  The platform

Near A Heavy Wood Pillar~
Rising stoically from the water, this huge wooden pillar supports a
platform of wood above your head.  Nearly as thick as a well-aged tree, this
shaft shows very few signs of rot.  A high water mark is visible a few feet
above the current surface of the water, delineated only by a thin white
line.  A few aquatic plants cling to the pillar just below the water\@s
surface, gently swaying with the lapping waves of the lake.  A ladder which
has been carved out of the wooden shaft leads up to the top of the platform.
A pillar similar to this, without any carving, stands to the north.  The

Surrounded by mud, this plain is slightly sunk from the areas around it.

A tepid pool of water sits, filthy.  Cut off by a thin strip of land from
the lake to the west, the water seems to have deveolped an ecosystem of its
own.  Mosquitoes are incredibly prominent in the air above it, for many of
them seem to have made their home in and around the stagnant water.  The mud
below the pool is quite depressed, providing drainage for all of the ground
around it.  A thick, rotting board separates the pool from the backlot to
the south.  A plain sits only a hair higher to the north, and it also
appearing to be quite waterlogged.  Eastward, the shore cradles the waters
of Jasa Lake, while a damp plain rises to the west.

village of well-kept houses.  A few dilapidated huts are visible through the

The overgrown path to the east and south opens here before a seemingly

southwest, this hut seems to have been subjected to a number of floodings. 
Its walls bow out at the bottom, and the wood of the building is stained,
cracking, and mouldering all over.  The area around here looks as if it was
once part of the village but has been overrun with plants for many years.  A
number of reptilian footprints pock the mud, giving it an uneven appearance.
The doorless frame to the east leads into the hut, and a particularly dense
wall of reeds blocks passage to the north.

save from the doorframe to the west and a rather large hole in the northeast
corner of the roof.  Water drips from the hole in the roof, keeping the
uneven ground perpetually damp.  Reptilian footprints cover the mud in
small, water-filled craters, and a few body-shaped divots are sunk deep in
the mud in the northwest corner.  A boarded up door blocks passage to the

Following the pebble-filled shoreline to the north, the ground here is
alternately covered with pebbles and firmly-packed dirt.  The passing of
hundreds of feet have worn both soil and mud to a smooth finish here, where
only a few errant weeds dare to grow.  A small pier is anchored into the
shore to the north, jutting out into the low-lying shallows of the lake. 
The hard packed ground continues to the east and west, and the center of the
village lies southward.

A Backlot~
Here, the reeds of Jasa Lake are not present, but in their place stand a
profusion of grasses and weeds.  The marsh grass here stands nearly three
feet tall, each stalk with a tassled top.  Interspersed among the grass are
a number of prickly weeds, most of which are crowned with a large purple
flower.  Each flower has a slight odor, adding to the already strongly
scented humid atmosphere.  The grasses and weeds continue to the north and

This one-room shack has been converted from a living quarters into a

hooks, curved fishing spears, and bottles upon bottles full of worms.  The
wall facing the once kitchen area is entirely devoid of decoration save for
a line of fishing rods and pikes set neatly in a row.  Near the back of the
store, a simple wooden crate, similar to those used by farmers to cart about
their produce, sits on its end, blocking off access to the back third of the
room to customers.  The door to the store to the east sits open, leading

Marsh grasses and weeds cover the ground in this locale, rustling softly

stands about five inches shorter than most of the lavender-capped weeds.  A
few brambles make their presence known, most of which cling to the back of
the hut to the west.  The back wall of the shack is mildewed and dirty but
is otherwise entirely featureless.  A path leads through the plants toward

building look quite precarious.  A number of reptilian footprints mark the
mud, and a mark of a curled-up reptilian body is sunk into the dirt in the
northeast corner.  A pile of broken, mildew-covered pieces of wood that may
have once been furniture sits in the southwest corner of the hut, but

on foot quite difficult.  The bushes rise into a high thicket to the east,

The center of the lazy village, Jaras Square is by far the most lively

to a meager wooden fountain which provides the villagers with fresh potable
water.  The shanties that line the square seem to stare at the fountain
blankly, their mildewy facades yawning.  The relatively large building to

leaf hanging above its door.  The pavement of the square hugs closely to the

Cluttered with personal belongings, this fisherman\@s living quarters are
incredibly messy.  The bone remains of a number of fish lie in a bucket,
releasing a rank odor into the air.  The wet remnants of yesterday\@s fishing
gear are slumped in a corner, where the floorboards have turned a sickly
mildew-black.  An uneven cot stands across from this, one of its legs
replaced by a stack of mud bricks.  The flat table which runs along the
southern wall is nigh invisible due to the highly-stacked mass of dirty
plates, half-eaten food, and used rags which lays upon it.  The walls
and floorboards of the room are untreated, their natural wood color tinted
with green in spots.  A door in the eastern wall is the only means of exit.

A Grassy Plot~
This small plot of land sits forgotten behind the shack that stands,
facing away, to the east.  The marsh grasses here have been let to grow
wild, and a number of brambly weeds have sprung up in inopportune spots. 
Each weed stands taller than the tassled grass, giving the plain an uneven
appearance.  A small fishing hut lies to the east, its mouldering siding
showing no means of entry or exit.  The mixture of grasses and weeds
continues to the north and south, while the grass fades to reed westward.

An Overgrown Plain~
The land here is drier than the marshlands near the lake, yet the air
still has a distinctively wet smell.  The sky is clearly visible from here
since the blossoming reeds have been kept in check by the overwhelming
abundance of grasses and weeds.  This plain is quite overgrown, with wild
plants seeming to crowd each other out for space and thusly obscuring one\@s
view to the dirt.  The plain continues much as it is here to the north,
south, and east, while a dense patch of reeds blocks passage to the west.

A Small, Thickly-Grassed Plot~
There are more grasses here than there are reeds, yet prickly and thorny
weeds abound.  Standing nearly a foot taller than the calf-high marsh grass,
many of the weeds are crested with deep purple flowers.  A small path

A path here slips between the crooked house to the south east and the hut
to the north.  A barrel sits here, collecting rainwater from the roof of the
northern hut, keeping the ground dry compared to the mud around it.  The
grass which lines the path has been trampled to a dead color of burnt umber.
A full grown marsh is to the west, behind the northern hut.  Southward, a
general goods store shares its space with a deep-set marsh.  The village is

A Fishing Village~
Within the village, the aura of laziness is nearly palpable.  Little
activity happens here, and the houses which surround Jaras Square to the
north seem to stare longingly at it.  Here, the lack of activity is somewhat
bleak.  A few weeds have burst through the hard-packed mud and clay of the
ground, and the silky fuzz of grass that has sprouted looks like it has been
trampled recently.  The mud and clay give way to a sunken patch of marsh to
the south, while the village continues north, east, and west.

A Grassy Marsh~
This grassy area seems to have been trampled and let grow back a number
of times.  The ground and flora are uneven with the marks of many
footprints, most of which have been made by birds and other small animals. 
Flowering plants cover the uneven ground, yet a number of reeds are still
present, towering above them.  The reeds grow more thickly to the north and
east.  Reeds dominate to the south, where the ground curves downward
slightly.  The westward path has far fewer plants, and a fishing village is

half, save a few tall rocks which have sunk most of the way into the mire.

This building is about the same size as the other homes in the village,

sits near the back.  The shelves are stocked with the trappings of everday
life; pots, pans, oil, lamps, flour, and so on.  Inside the glass case are
kept the more precious items for sale, specifically a few hunting and

A large locked cupboard hangs along the northern wall, above a pot-bellied
stove.  A thick black kettle gurgles atop the stove, filling the room with a
none too pleasant aroma.  A number of small cots circle two larger ones, set
in the southeast corner of the room.  A large glassless window is set in the

In a Large House~
This cramped and squalid room has the appearance of a well used home.  A
single large cot sits in the northwestern corner, its cover ripped in many
places to expose the hay within.  Across from the cot, a window has been cut
in the wall and its expanse has been covered with a stained and ratted
gauze.  A small, poorly made cabinet hangs along the eastern wall, its
locking mechanism broken off.  The mildewed walls on which the cabinet hangs
give the room a claustrophobic feeling, and the only exits are the
rectangular holes to the east and south.

A Diving Board~
Hovering in space over the lake, this wooden plank seems to be inviting
you to jump from it.  The tip of the board is perpetually damp, most likely
from a combination of wet footprints and the constant humidity of the air
here.  The platform to the south beckons to those weak of heart.

Near an Intersection of Submerged Stone Walls~
The walls to the north and west seem to have collided here, creating a
rocky mess that would appear scalable, were it above the surface of the
water.  To the east and south, the clear waters of Jasa lake open wide,
filled with sub-aquatic life.  The sandy ground here is clear of plantlife,
yet many small spaces between the fallen rocks provide ample space for fish
to make their homes or to hide from predators.

An Underwater Tunnel~
A bit of sand sprinkles down from above into the darkened tunnel here. 
It is wide enough for two to pass in tandem, but there is little room for
more.  The rock walls have been smoothed by the gently flowing water, giving
each face a rounded, soft look.  The ceiling and floor are both decorated
with a thin layer of algae which gently shimmers with every disturbance of
the water around it.  To the east, the tunnel twists and disappears into
