An elderly srryn sits here, green scales dulled and chipped.  He seems
uncomfortable--the expression on his face indicates that he\@d rather not be
here.  He looks about warily, eyes narrowed, and occasionally reaches a
clawed finger to scratch under the softer and mottled yellow skin under his
jaw.

a dark-clad human~
A dark-clad human sits in the shadows of the corner of the room.
~
This human is a man of indeterminate age, with sharp features and a thick
black mustache with waxed tips that hang down past his jaw.  His eyes are
cold and calculating, and he seems to have that rare abilitity of taking in
everything at once without looking at anything in particular.  He keeps one
hand down below the table and out of sight, but the other is wrapped around
a simple briar pipe.  He draws upon the pipe from time to time, and smoke
curls up from between his thin lips.

a silver-haired ch\@taren bard~
A silver-haired ch\@taren bard sits near the hearth.
~
This youthful ch\@taren woman is dressed as a performing bard, in bright
colors that accent her golden skin artfully.  Her silver hair is caught up
in an unusual fashion, with small braided strands twisted around a circular
hair piece, with the effect of having her hair seem to form a silver crown. 
Her hands are delicate, but with fingertips calloused from countless hours
of play on her instruments.

A water elemental directs the current to the south.

A water elemental is here, unaffected by the flow of the currents.  Its
form is distinguishable from the surrounding water only by an unnatural
glimmer which reveals its amorphous outline.  It flows gracefully about as
it works to refocus the current in a single direction.

An ethron merchant sits behind a display of pipes.
~
An elderly ethron with pale moss-white hair sits near his merchandise. 
He has a very calm and world-weary look to him, as if he\@s seen it all
before more, and more than once, and nothing would surprise him.  He smells
strongly of pungent tabbak.

An elderly ch\@taren healer stands near the altar.

The temple healer, an elderly ch\@taren with platinum-white hair, stands
at the altar.  His wrinkled golden skin shimmers behind the aegis of
protective water spells, and his eyes are the clear dark blue of an Alensha
evening sky.  His bearing is one of respectful attentiveness.

Ryathen Wraliala~
A ch\@taren bard sits behind a small table.
~
Ryathen is a young ch\@taren bard with a broad smiling face and piercing
emerald green eyes.  Her shimmering golden form seems a bundle of energy
even when she sits.  She taps her fingers absently along the tabletop,
seeming rather bored to be stuck with greeter duty in the performance hall.

A portly human stands here, working on an unfinished instrument.

A human who has a rather small frame but a very large waist stands here. 
The curly beard on his face, as well as his ample belly, hold the evidence
of his recent woodworking--small aromatic curled chips of cherry wood.  His
calloused fingers, when not holding or inspect instruments or the pieces
that form them, drum staccato rhythms on his legs.

A large white butterfly is here.
~
Large white wings, the size of dinner plates, hold this butterfly aloft. 
It flutters about in no particular pattern, its antennae flicking nimbly
above its walnut-sized, gem-like eyes.

a white gull~
A white gull is here.
~
The great gull is larger than its lesser cousins, and its sea-opal eyes
observe the world with an apparent intelligence.  Feathers of pristine white
cover its sleek body, the purity of color only broken by the soft blue
frosting which borders its slender bill and webbed feet.  Its beady gaze is
placid.  Its snowy wings, when opened, rival a human\@s armspan in their
breadth.

This spacious single-room dwelling is built in the ch\@taren style, with
an odd number of short white stone walls, each of varying lengths, forming a
roughly circular shape.  Broad windows are set in each of the walls, giving
a clear view of the nearby street and the thick foliage surrounding the
house.  The occupants have very few posessions--simple beds, low tables,
drapes and blankets in bright hues--yet the atmosphere is nonetheless one
that many would consider warm and welcoming.

A ch\@taren alchemist sits here, lost in her thoughts.
~
This pretty ch\@taren woman sits in contemplation, her brow creased.  She
is dressed in a comfortable, sleeveless robe and her dark silver hair is
pulled back from her face in a bun.  The golden skin of her hands is scarred
in places, alchemical burns leaving a less translucent shade in their wake. 
She pays little attention to her surroundings, lost in her own musings.

accommodate a fat cork plug.  Neatly tucked behind him are wings of dappled
white, grey, and brown.  His bald head has been waxed to a polished gleam,

~
Finely dressed and elegantly groomed, this aelin woman looks every inch
the lady she is.  A noble from a distant land, she has come to Jh\@ten with
her husband to further increase the influence of their house.  Her pale
blue-white wings arch gracefully from her back and her hair is decorated
with crystals, making it appear to be covered in a latticework of ice.

an elderly caladaran ringsmith~
A tall caladaran with white hair stands here, arms folded.
~
This caladaran is rather burly for his race (a traditionally slender,
willowy people).  Wiry cords of muscle wrap his arms and chest.  His
textured, bark-like skin shows many glistening burn-scars, some fresh and
pale, others old and fading into the distinctive caladaran patterning. 
Bushy white hair has been painstakingly combed and braided into a controlled
shape.

A hefty scholar immerses himself in his studies.

This scholar\@s full-length robes reflect the light of the room in subtle
shades of blue and green.  The robes do little to hide the man\@s great heft.
The bulge of his stomach is obvious, and his face is pudgy and red.  His
jowls are only partially hidden by long and fuzzy sideburns, while the rest
of his thinning hair is brushed straight back.  A bushy mustache perches
upon his lip.

Sienatheo Vh\@viel~
An elderly ch\@taren in garish yellow robes stands here.
~
This elderly ch\@taren wanders the library, his age-lined face twisted
into a mischevious grin.  His silver hair has receded to a fringe about his
ears, though he maintains a pointed, rapier-thin mustache above his lips. 
He wears garish robes of almost sun-bright yellow.  The material is so
excessively bright that one could almost mistake it for being enchanted to
shed light.

note + neon\@s simple water templar prog
note + weapon configuration: sword/no shield
note + special thanks to brazen for initial monkeywork
note + this prog will get a mob performing recognizably as a water templar.
note + it is \@simple\@ because the prog reacts solely to the mob\@s own circumstances
 it does not
note + take into account the manner in which its opponents are fighting or group configuration.
note + 
note + the mob will do the following:
note + -maintain all standard water templar buffs out of combat
note + -use form of the winter wind and seek to remain in form
note + -frostbrand and rune of life his weapon
note + -punish people who flee out of the fight and come back
note + -use wall of water semi-intelligently
 it will only do so if he has aquamove up
note + -heal himself
note + -cast a lot of icebolt
note + -heatsink sometimes and also freeze if he is underwater
note + -respect lag incurred by his own spells and skills
note + -has sparring functionality for members of his own class
note + 
note + this mob makes heavy use of mpaddskill, including gaining second and third attacks through this
note + in order to facilitate PCs using skills which will reduce attacks on this mob
note + under no circumstances should this be placed on a mob that has act warrior or off fast set.
note + because this prog is intended to be used to simulate PC behaviour, I recommend against using
note + aff haste with this, as well.

\@ Thank you. For your kindness, I will tell you a tale.
\@ Florina and the Feet of Jolinn, it is called.
\@ Long ago, in lands far distant, lived a woman named Florina.
\@ When she was a maiden, she was famed for her beauty.
\@ Suitors traveled from all the lands roundabout to seek her hand.
emote gestures as she speaks, her motions and expressions captivating.
\@ However, she found none of these suitors interesting.
\@ Oddly enough, the man who interested her most was an aged priest of Jolinn.
\@ Often she would speak with him, debating philosophy and life\@s deepest meanings.
\@ They would speak of piety, though she followed no deity.
\@ It came to be a challenge for the priest, to convince her to follow Jolinn.
\@ And she relished the challenge of countering the priest\@s arguments.
\@ And in this manner, the maiden grew to middle age, still single.
emote stops for a moment to clear her throat.
\@ One afternoon, Florina spied from her window a handsome man.
\@ He walked briskly by her home, and she became curious about him and his destination.
\@ She followed him as he passed through the city and entered the temple of Jolinn.
\@ Watching from a distance, she saw him approach a mighty statue of Jolinn.
\@ With fevered devotion, the man knelt and kissed the feet of the statue.
\@ Long after he departed, Florina remained, struck by the man\@s devotion.
\@ What would it be like, she wondered, to feel such a passion?
\@ At last, she approached the statue, knelt, and kissed the feet as had the man.
\@ She felt the stone of the statue, warm and moist beneath her lips.
\@ Suddenly feeling foolish, she returned to her home.
emote pauses dramatically.
\@ She died of a fever three days later.
emote eases back into her chair, eyes half-shut.

In the darkest days of the War of Fire 
The water magics were born 
One of the first who wielded the life 
Was Arafia, the Ctanes 
His diamond heart he gave in whole 
To Istera the Fair 
Bliss they knew and love most true 
But such is never safe. 
Evil watched them hatefully; 
And tore their hearts apart. 
Ctanes himself exposed to hurt 
By giving his heart to Istera 
Bound in the nether pits. 
Arafia sought aid afar 
But no help did he gain 
Few indeed the pits can find 
Or enter would therein. 
Ctanes\@s love would not let him rest 
So sought he high and low 
Until at last his calls were heard 
By Vaialos the pure. 
Vaialos pity took upon 
The templar tall and brave 
The arm of Vaialos he stretched 
And reached across the planes. 
He took to him a mortal form 
And aid broght to Ctanes 
He took him to the edge of death 
But could not enter in. 
\#Arafia,\# the avatar spoke 
\#Henceforth hie thee alone. 
\#But do not fear; I give thee here 
\#A charmed dove to bear within.\# 
The platinum dove was bound with spells 
Of armor for the mind 
Its bearer would if all went well 
Retain his will and soul. 
Arafia thanked the avatar 
And steeled himself as best he could 
Though battles myriad he\@d fought 
The pits were not for mortals made. 
Arafia he entered in 
And what he did inside 
Has been revealed to no one 
Who can say what there betide 
But this is known: emerge he did 
With Istera by his side. 
The mortal with the diamond heart 
Had triumphed over all the worst 
That evil set against him. 
And in the end he wedded her 
Thus proving for all time 
That courage, love, and purity 
The ultimate victory will have 
Though all the world and all below 
Should stand to block its way. 
The power of love is greater than that 
Which all the void can bring to bear. 
To do that thought impossible 
Requires only will.

In the War of Night, the ch\@taren hosts drawn from their native realm of

Most of this equipment was formed of ch\@lonin, the rare spirit substance. 
After the war, to extend the application of this materials, ch\@taren
crafters rendered down their items and applied the ch\@lonin to equipment and
structures fashioned of materials from the Prime Plane.  The ch\@lonin melded
easily with most of these materials, forming steel-hardened translucent
streaks of a golden hue throughout stone, steel, and other materials.

the bastard sword, \#Naia\#~
Naia, the bastard sword of Asathewe, lies here.~
In the War of Night, after the ch\@taren fought free from the 
shuddeni involved in the great and failed summoning,
they sought to learn more of the new lands they found themselves in.
They also sought to learn of the other inhabitants of the world,
trusting that not all could be like the twisted shuddeni.

It did not take long before they encountered forces of resistance
against the shuddeni domination. The first ch\@taren to communicate
and begin to establish an alliance with the forces of light was
a wise elder named An\@riserai. He was able to help quickly bring
about the formal alliance between ch\@taren and the resistance which
hasted the demise of the shuddeni on the surface. He also perished
in one of the final battles of the war.

Having become close friends with two archmages of water, a human
and a caladaran, An\@riserai was memorialized by them in a weaponcrafting,
and the sword, Naia, became a relic of goodwill between casters of
spirit and water.

The first of all our journies

How soon we stumbled,
A slipping, slender lurch
With a tall awkwardness,
Not even to the dim caves
When the moons hid
And the stars were veiled.
Your gentle, goodly grace
(in spirit--if not form)
Drew me along,
A frail-winged moth
Trailing the glimmer-promise
Of your mysterious new light.
Before the week was spent
We watched the morning sky
In Elanthamir\@s chilly splendor.
How far and pale and bleak,
That bright suspended canvas
Painted by the day-dawn,
When I had living light,
A brush of golden fire
At my side.

You have gone ahead,
And I (without a torch)
Will follow when I may.
I look eastward--eastward!
For farewells we said it,
But there are none
When words over stone
Weigh less than the promise
Of long-tried love.
You are in the morning east,
Your brushstrokes lighting
The golden dawn.

Dawn breaks above the solitary keep,
The cock\@s crow rouses Krilin from its sleep.
A young but valiant soldier, sword in hand,
Strides forth to purge the giants from the land.

He sees a hulking brute across a gulf,
With club in hand, and followed by a wolf.
The soldier leaps the chasm in one bound,
The giant turns and roars, a dreadful sound.

The battle joins with awful howl and yell,
But then the giant cries and breaks the spell!
\#You hit me on the hand!\#

\#Did so!\#
\#Don\@t you tell ma!\#
\#I will, and off I go!\#

And to the keep he runs, tears in his eyes,
His pup in tow, and barking in surprise
To go back home so early in the day--
This soldier rarely quits so soon at play.

In children\@s games we see an echoed life,
A world of pain and fear, a world of strife.
We too seek love and safety\@s warm embrace,
A yearning all our years cannot replace.

{WThe Foolish Manservant{n
[continued]

Several years passed, with the manservant always providing
companionship and wise councel to the prince.  Yet there
came a day, when, facing a dangerous dragon, the manservant
slipped from his horse, and as the others attempted to help
him, several of the party were slain, and the prince severely
injured.  Such was the shame of the manservant, who had begun
to taken great pride in his wisdom and his usefulness to the
prince, that he could no longer bear to be in the prince\@s
company.   He feared as well that such incompetence as he had
shown might cause his prince further injury, and so he departed
for his village, sadly reminding the prince that he had never
truly sworn fealty.

Once back at his village, the village elder, who was a holy
man, talked long with the manservant.  Once hearing the
story the manservant told of his time with the prince, he
became incensed.  \#Fool, and twice fool!\# he reprimanded.

\#Oh, I was indeed, the way I fell off that horse!\# replied
the manservant.

The elder sighed sadly.  \#Accidents happen, and I do not
name you fool for such.  But in your pride, you took it
upon yourself to decide to end the bond between you,
and such bonds do not dissolve over accidents, nor do
for stretching them the distance between the castle and our
village.\#

He who had been a manservant was dismayed, and asked what he
might do.  The elder replied, \#Learn this lesson, at least:
never forsake the trust and love of those who hold you dear.
Such is not easily come by, and should never be discarded.\#

The youth, greatly chastised and penitent, returned to his
prince, and whether he was taken back into the prince\@s
confidence and trust--that is another tale.

{WThe Foolish Manservant{n

There was once a humble youth from a remote forest village.
The youth had a keen mind and an aptitude for observing the
world around him, and was soon noted by all for his wisdom.

He eventually obtained notice even from the prince of the
realm, who journeyed to the remote village to meet the
youth.  The prince found great pleasure in his company,
and made the youth his manservant, which was a great honor
to he and the village.  As they journeyed back to the
prince\@s home, and underwent many a harrowing experience
on their way, a bond of great friendship grew between the
two.

Once at the prince\@s castle, the prince asked the manservant
to take the formal vow of fealty which was generally required
of those who served him.

The manservant replied \#I could not do so, as words promised
before a throne mean less driftwood on the waves, for
hearts change even as the currents that pass within them.\#
He continued, \#Let us mingle instead our souls, a truer bond
between us.\#  And so they each cut their hands, and mingled
the blood, and the prince was satisfied.

The Spirit Palace was first suggested about a decade after the magics of
air had been let loose upon the land.  Realizing the destructive force
of pure entropy, and the seeming weakening of the barrier between the magic
of air and the prime material in the clouds around the ancient Mountain
Enrien, a young human scholar suggested a place of work and magic be
built nearby.  Not only would this palace serve to watch over the beings
of chaos that roamed this energy-charged place, but it would also be a
symbol of the strength and hope that spirit magic itself represented.
The young man, Heclan Nayber, would become the first Arch-Mage of the
Spirit Palace, and its first leader.  Always wise beyond his years, his
decision was oft proven a good one as time progressed.
~
E
tome3~
The Spirit Palace, in all its beauty and glory, has attracted many who
hate it for those it houses.  Between the six magics a balance has always
existed, keeping a peace that is understood by most powerful scholars.
Envy and hate cloud reason, however, and during the rule of the fifth
great Arch-Mage, Gaene Vosatair, dark stirrings were heard.  A group of
void and fire scholars broke from their guilds to create their own sect,
the Maevis\@Hra, which loosely translates into \#Bringers of Darkness\#.
Hoping to eliminate the presence of the golden light that is Spirit,
they performed many dark rituals, a twisted meld of pain and darkness.
Believing themselves strong enough to fight this small sect, the many
schools of spirit around Avendar prepared to defend themselves, and those
at the palace settled down for war.

To the spirit scholars, triumph was never in doubt.  The Arch-Mage,
however, had underestimated the Maevis\@Hra and their fanatical devotion
to their cause.  The night the Maevis\@Hra struck has been burned into
legend as the greatest tragedy ever to befall the scholars of Spirit.
All over Avendar spirit schools were besieged by scholars and their vile
demons.  The guild in Drellan Myr fell early, burned to the ground by
unnatural fires, and not leaving any survivors.  For the Spirit Palace
was saved the darkwalkers strongest ally, the demon lord Kzroth, a being of
fire and destruction.  He cut through the palace defences easily,
feasting on the bodies of those he killed, and growing stronger for each
one.
~
E
tome4~
Knowing the demon must be stopped, or it would most likely succeed in
destroying the palace, Arch-Mage Vosatair went out to fight him alone,
giving his body up to become a true avatar.  By giving all his soul to
his transformation, he became more powerful than any before him, burning
up his own life energy.  The battle between the Arch-Mage and Kzroth was
long, but eventually Kzroth was weakened enough to be trapped.  The
remaining Maevis\@Hra fled at his defeat, and Kzroth was locked in a
magically warded cell within the mountain.  When the cell was closed,
the Arch-Mage fell and as the consuming light dissipated, so did he, until
nothing remained of either.
~
E
tome5~
Many years after the War of Night, when the Spirit Palace had become
fairly well established, it was noticed that some strange activity was
happening in the caves of Mount Enrien.  Unsettled by this, as it was very
close to the prison of the demon lord Kzroth, a few scholars were sent to
explore and establish what had happened.  

In the mountain they found a group of nefortu who referred to themselves as
\#Kohli\# and appeared to be the last remanents of a divergent race which had
lived for many years deep underground.  Observing the kohli while invisible,
it was eventually deduced that some massive, evil creature had forced them
from their homes, and was responsible for their now sparse population.  The
amber dragon, upon hearing the details, realized it was the void dragon
Tzet-Sabanthe.  

Knowing the pure corruption and evil that the dark dragon was, the amber
dragon sought it and drove it off, unwilling to allow it to destroy an
entire race.  The kohli, thankful and awestruck, came to worship the amber
dragon as their deity, and elected to stay in their new city, close to their
god.  It was not until sometime later that the details of this were
discovered, however, due to the generally seclusive nature of the amber
dragon.

Page Two, Of Dorrod and the Stones

Jolinn came and stood at the Aristhe\@s edge, and called upon waters to bring
forth the treasures of the deep.  Soon after, the waves swept all manner of
lost treasure to the shore: troves precious coins, countless gems and
jewels, and sundry magical works and artifacts--the lost bounty of the Age
of Legends.  Jolinn gathered the 10 stones to himself, and touched each one,
causing them to grow in size and weight, so that never again one person
alone could possess all the stones.  

Jolinn spoke a word of creation, and from the energies of the lost artifacts
of the age of Legends channeled through the stones, he fashioned a glowing
golden being.  The Seafather bestowed upon this being the flame of immortal
life and named him Dorrod.  Jolinn charged Dorrod to see that none but the
truly deserving receive of the treasure on the glittering shore, and to use
the power and influence given him to see that mortals prosper only from
their honest labor and goodly endeavors.  

Since that time, when mortals have worked with steadfast diligence, not for
greed\@s sake alone, but for the benefit of all around them, it is said that
Dorrod blesses their efforts with prosperity.

** This scroll is written on duskin hide, and seems to be a simple

Of Dorrod and the Stones It is told that in the days of the Alatharya, the
conclave of enchanters known as the Iphesta presented Iandir with a bracelet
of wondrous gemstones.  These stones were made of pure and unified magic,
crystals facted to perfection, and set in a chain of woven light and gold. 
It was a gift of power and beauty truly befitting a God.  Iandir in turn
entrusted the bracelet to his favored servant among the Alatharya, Qilaunin
the Geomancer.  

Years passed, and with the Bracelet of Power on his wrist, Qilaunin began to
grow somewhat vain and foolish.  One day, when the winged C\@thsa came to
wreak havoc on the cities of the Alatharya, Qilaunin rose to challenge them
alone, rather than seek aid.  On dragonback he pursued the creatures, till
they turned upon him over the Aristhe Ocean.  Qilaunin was sorely wounded,
and the bracelet rent apart.  Its stones plummeted into the deeps of the
Aristhe.  Qilaunin fled, and the creatures did much damage before they were
at last driven from the land.  

After the battle, Qilaunin returned to the shores of the Aristhe and tried
spell after spell to reclaim the stones, but all failed.  Having lost of the
favor of Iandir, he repented of his foolishness and begged Jolinn
Seafather\@s help.

Missive to the Nsaia, from Caerlath - On the Yaoye Crystal 

On the fourth item from the Ksatha takings, that is, the small crystal
seized from the black priests of the Ksatha in the battle of Ianiair Thema:
It is a small and strange sculpture of pure, clear crystal.  Nearly a
handspan in length, its form is most irregular, with odd twists and bends,
save for one clear facet in which cloudy images of distant and strange
landscapes can be seen.  These landscapes change from time to time.  

Our studies determined that it was not of demonic or otherwise tainted
origins, and so it was preserved.  Further study determined that it was, of
all the objects seized, by far the most powerful and ancient, and scholars
from the Earendam libraries to the White Castle were discreetly consulted as
to lore surrounding it.  

It was eventually learned that this was none other than the Yaoye, one of
the most potent artifacts of the ancient alatharya to survive the sundering
and remain in mortal hands.  It was once kept by aelin, but was stolen from
them in years prior to the great wars.  

According to lore, the ancient alatharyan enchanters fashioned this to serve
as a focus for a small region in the plane of dreams.  They would then use
this region for trials at arms.  One common trial was that of the miscreant,
guilty of misdeeds.  If such a one survived the \#walk\#, passing through the
gauntlet of dream-fashioned creatures and dangers to emerge living, they
were deemed to have been sufficiently punished by the Gods.  

Ys\@raiva trainers have been given the crystal to aid in their work, at their
request, and with my and Acraeihii\@s approval.  It is a danger, but true
training must be dangerous, lest we fall to weakness when strength and skill
are most needed.

Yet whoever shall presume to obtain the height of this art, according
to our most secret ways without the observing and understanding
of Urbergeron, will certainly find himself mightily mistaken at
last, having after a great deal of troubles, charges, and pains,
reaped nothing but discontent and on the contrary they, that shall
walk in our true and infallible lore, shall with very little trouble
and expenses attain to their desired end, which we cordially wish
to all those who are sincere well-wishers to the alchemic philosophy.
But the true student looks beyond the base element to see all other
aspects and virtue, vice and design which touch the foundation of
property. These number many, are known to none but the minds of
those who command the ancient by will, and of their influence
are as lasting as the nine.

And there is Alteration for Enhancement.
And there is Detection from Beguilement. 
And there is Travel in the bounds of the Planar.
And there is Healing of Damage.
And there is Benediction against Malediction. 
And there is Revelation from Obscurement. 
And there is Chaos against Order. 
And there is Protection against Weather. 
And there is Knowledge from Mental. 
And there is Summoning for Conjuration. 
And there is Breath of Time.

And these in aspect shape the making even as the element stands at the crux
of essence to bring about what the hands of the philosopher shall fashion.
And this work of the essence from its very beginning to its perfect end may,
on our certain knowledge, be perfected by any skillful and careful artist,
that knows the lore of Urbergeron, unless some accident should happen in
the preparation of our great works: which to prevent, we wrought them with
care, and for better effect in a place of sufficient design and material
which is most agreeable to the practice of the wisest of philosophers.

Although some students of the art, possessed with foolish notions,
dream that the first matter is to be found only in some particular
places, at such and such times of the year yet we are most 
certain (according to our master Urbergeron) that, all these
suppositions being false, it is to be found everywhere, at all
times and only by our lore and its application. For in the vision 
of Urbergeron, he saw an empty void of shadow, seperated from
the not-void only by a halo of spirit.

Then came powers, of the Ancient to Transmogrify, and it so was
wrought according to the will, between shadow and light, the 
fundaments of Earth, Fire, Water, and Air (which, with life begun 
in Spirit and gnawed to consumption by Void, are Nature). And the 
powers utilized and wrought our essence first, essence of element, 
essence of truest being, with which all things resonate in degree 
according to their very material stuff and according to the shaping 
of type. And so there are nine, and nine is the chief and most 
foremost number in the lore of he who would know. He who sees, of 
the study and teaching of Urbergeron, can sense their influence in 
all.

Now I do not wonder, as I did before, why philosophers of the art,
having attained knowledge by experience in full, have not cared to
have their days shortened (although by the virtue of their work they
could have prolonged them) for every true philosopher has all so
clearly set before his eyes, as your face is seen in a glass. Thus
much by way of reply to the frivolous objections of those that
believe not the verity of this art, who hold word and gesture
to be superior to substance. If you should discover to them the 
process of the common alchemic stone, let alone that great prize
long sought by many, they would laugh at your simplicity, and I
will warrant you never make use of it. Nay, if you should make
projection before them, they would think that even in that there
was a fallacy, so wedded to the scholarship of unbelief are they.
So I find them, and so I leave them, and shall forever find 
them the same.

To the aspiring novice of alchemy, little is of greater concern than the
interplay and partitioning of the nine elements of Avendar.  A solid footing
within this inner circle is crucial before one can hope to choose his path
through the outer. 
  
Take heed of the properties of the various elements:
  
-Earth{n, source of order and strength.
-Air{n, force of chaos that wears down the highest mountains.
-Fire{n, which consumes and destroys.
-Water{n, sustenance of life present in all flesh
-Spirit{n, conduit between soul and body
-Void{n, element of darkness and death
-The Ancient{n and scarce magic of those that lived before the Sundering
-Nature{n, the unruly force of growth and beginning
-And Change{n, the transmogrification of one body into another

useful and important.  It is the task of the expert alchemist to pick apart
these primary weaves of magic and reform them, melding them into a more
useful product.  

Modern scholars seek to call energy from the six prime planes, controlling
their weaves through inflection of voice and tone of command, using a
vocabulary discovered after the Sundering.  The method of the alchemist has
distinct advantages over such short-term and singular use of the elements,
as all material necessary for our work lies here on the material plane,
waiting to be reshaped to our need.  Instead of calling the weaves directly
from an elemental plane, we use the permanence of material to bind our
weaves up into fluid, matter, and oil.  

Once a master of the Eye can discern where materials fall on the Inner
Circle, he can understand the paths that are possible through the Outer. 
For instance, as a sword has already been forged with the purpose to harm,
it shall be easier to reform its flows into a spell which does harm in its
own right.  The magic running through a shield meant to protect can be most
easily manipulated into a brew of protection.  It is upon these nuances that
I shall focus the training required for my admission to the twenty-second
rank of our guild.

{WA True and Factual Account of the War of Night{n
     
It is well known that the Shuddeni Hosts rose up from
their exile beneath the earth and brought to bear
their potent and orderly magics on the forces
of chaos above. Ours was a misson of wisdom, for the
lands above were barbaric and untamed with naught but
meaningless bloodshed and petty, pointless rule.
The first offensives were mighty and
our forces waxed powerful as we took Var Bandor with
our void magics. Our teleporting and gating allowed us
to bypass the walls of the delta city and take it as
our own. The bulk of their forces manned their walls
and gatehouses. The fools were routed with our clever
ploy as they were assaulted from without and within!
The leader of the merchant council fell blubbering before
our Warlord Athirsar. Our war-leader took his head as well
as the head of every sixth grown man of Var Bandor to top
the pikes that surrounded the city. The forest of skulls 
has been carefully maintained with our magics.
~
E
codex2~
Next was the destruction of the Tower of Aramril, as
our organized armies brought forth an aspect of our
Most Just Dragon to judge the worth of the Champions.
They were found unworthy and unfocused and our forces
razed the tower to the ground with no losses, so feeble
was the defence of the Tower of Yellow Stone. It is
said their soldiers broke rank and fled at the first
sign of their loss (which was quickly indeed!). Their
cowardice saw them routed, and the survivors begged
for their lives, pledging their service to the Eternal
Dragon. The Wyrm does not suffer traitors, however,
and their lives were ended at great length. The tower
stands no longer, now. Not even rubble marks its location.
  
We marched upon Earendam next, and laid a long seige.
Despite the overthrow of its just Senate by a corrupt
Patrician, the city defended itself. We took to our
potent arts of manipulating the void to bring about
a grand conjunction; a gate between worlds that would
stand for three days as the hosts of the void poured
forth at our whim!
~
E
codex3~
When the time came, the gate opened, and strange golden
beings came out to do battle, having foolishly hijacked
the portal of our destiny to confront us. They were
outnumbered hopelessly, and their pitiful magics were
easily dispelled and their forces overwhelmed. Once
the usurpers were dealt with the gate was truly opened
and the hosts of the void poured forth! A hundred days
of darkness fell over Avendar as our forces, filled with
potent Eshithi and void magics, swept over the land.
City after city fell to our demon army and the great
shuddeni empire spread over the surface of the realm.
The lesser races were impressed into slavery or slaughtered
as needed to appease our Great Lords Beyond. The light
of Avendar was forever extinguished, and darkness reigns
to this day.

history6~
The ch\@taren settled among men, whose empire
lies shattered. The other races, long secluded by
humankind, came forth to a new Renaissance.
Some learned of the ways of the aelin, and
brought forth their own creation - the magic of
Air, which sought no rule, order, or code, merely
meaning in its own chaotic existence. 

Thus, all six of the great elemental magics were
brought to Avendar. Men, in time, sought to form
again their empire, but found the world too vast a
place - Ethron inhabitants of forest oaks, Dark
winged nefortu dangling in their dark places,
and even the alatharya of yore were returned in
diminished form. 

Still, for a time men formed a Republic on the
main continent of their home, but, in recent times,
these alliances were sundered by the raids of the
Kankoran barbarians and their allies. This has
resulted in the city states we see today -
Earandam the grand, Var Bandor, and even Ashta
Harrud, desert capitol of commerce. 

All races today find more meaning in finding their
own niche in the struggle for power, rather than a
great gasp at one empire. The Houses of Avendar
reflect this diversification of thought among the
people of Avendar. Likewise, the Scholars\@
Towers, were even the mages of void and spirit
exist in an uneasy detente. 

Moreso than any time in history, the world is a
wide place, separated by long distances, with
opportunity awaiting around every street corner
in the great cities. A time, where, perhaps, the
future belongs to those who would take it, and
dare to tread the Siege Perilous - a time for
adventurers..... 
~
E
history5~
Striking with meaning, order, and purpose rather
than out of blind rage, the forces of the Void
took cities, rather than burning them, and
corrupted them to their will. Mothers were
forced to offer their children as appeasement in
unholy rites, designed to serve the Things which
dwell beyond, some were kept as slaves, but the
cities under the sway of the Void lived, even if
they were more the corpses of cities than
anything resembling a living organism. 

The templars of water mounted counter-assault
after counter-assault. Some times, with success,
other times, with failures. For long 
years, the two sides held sway in a series of
enormous battles. With time, thought, the
Scholars of Water found their magic growing
weaker - the Things of the void had grown strong
on the flesh of the young, and pressed for more
mortal flesh. When all seem darkest, when even
great Earandam thought to send its children to
the aelin amidst the moutain, the unthinkable
happend in the ranks of the Void. 

Their dark rites prepared, their rituals chanted,
they brought forth not demons or other Things,
they brought forth instead the ch\@taren. The
ch\@taren, whether exiles from the world of
dreams or even the fabled astral plane, had used
the magic of the void against itself, and had
travelled into the Prime Material by means of
their gateways. 

Bringing with them large numbers and the magics
of the Spirit, they routed the dreadlord templars
of the void to their holes in the ground, where
those that served Fire waited, and picked off the
weak among them. Humans learned of the
freedom of the Spirit, and everywhere, cast off
their chains, and drove the fiends of the Void
back once more into seclusion. 

And, thus ended the War of the Night, where
men learned that the candle of hope flickers even
in the blackest of times. 
~
E
history4~
And yet, the aelin were not the ones to come to
dominance after the war. The humans, their
passion driving them still, slowly grew in numbers
across the surface of Avendar, while the aelin
remained in their cities, lost in the intracicies of
their own life. 

Those humans not already devoted to healing
learned much of the ways of earth from the god
Iandir, who brought law once more to the hills and
valleys of Avendar. Men paused in their mad
growth, and built cities, homes, places of staying,
order, and protection. 

And thus, many thousands of years passed.
Quarrels came and went, but none so great as a
war to drench and entire world in Fire. And so it
was that the empire of the Humans subsumed the
entire world. And yet, the humans were drawn to
more than just the surface, and began their
explorations of the nether regions of Avendar.
There, they found the great cities of the
shuddeni, a race blinded by the night, but who
still saw much, and gloried in the horror of the
demon sultans who taught them. 

Here, human scholars went who wished to learn
more. Tortured they were by the shuddeni, but
some, a few, learned their ways. Combining the
ritual of the shuddeni with the ancient learning of
the humans, the discipline of the Void was born. 

Who can say why the gods suffer such things to
exist? Certainly, the gods of the dark revel in the
Void, the Things which inhabit it not always of
their own creation, but often after their own
heart. Certainly, what the Scholars of the Void
did was the antithesis of life, and everything
living, but the gods of light could not bring and
end to them without disturbing the balance of the
world. 

So it was, those humans who studied with the
Shuddeni waxed mighty in their counsels, and
taught the shuddeni much of the ways of war. The
shuddeni culture, grown stagnant in their
millennia under stone, was re-energized by the
promise of conquest above the surface. On the
blackest night, of the darkest day of the year,
the humans and their shuddeni allies road forth
from the caves of their dank abyss, to usher in an
age of Night the world had never known. 
~
E
history3~
In their midnight rituals, the srryn had learned
much of the ways of fire. Fire to burn, fire to
make their will be done - fire, to destroy. The
humans, always more keen of wit, seized the
secrets of the srryn fire shamans, cultivated
among their numbers the first Scholars of Fire.
Savage men, of an unholy taste for pleasure and
power, unleashed their magics across the surface
of Avendar. 

Securing the yoke about their fellow men, the
great Scholars of Fire also trained warlords, or
templars of fire, to command in battle with the
sword, and yet still reign destruction with the
forces of fire. Most of the races scattered
before the hordes of humans and srryn that
plundered all they found, but the aelin stood to
defend their cities, and forged an alliance to
fight to keep the humans at bay, lest the night
consume all. 

Cities were reduced to ash. Aelin died in droves,
using their already small collection of ancient
artifacts to drive the humans back. And yet, again
and again the humans surged forward. Quick to
breed, quick to die, the humans stood at the
verge of a destruction that would consume all. 

Fortunately, not all among the humans thought as
the Scholars of Fire. Small in number, but
present, were humans who sought meaning in
more than brute destruction. Groping blindly,
they sought to bring peace, to heal, to purify.
They craved a life spent in other activity than
blind devotion to an orgy of chaos and
destruction. 

Praying to the gods, they were answered. Jolinn,
Father of the Seas, Lord of the Sapphire Spear,
sent these brave few to seek the titans, who
dwelt high in the mountains, where they had
slumbered since the Sundering. Waking, they
taught the humans of the magics of Water, and of
the strength of the Seas. These humans
returned, and became the first of the Scholars
of Water. Born to bring healing to a troubled
land, their love of life quenched the inferno of the
fire mage\@s hate. With their aid, the aelin drove
the armies of Fire back to the swamps, where
most of the Scholars of Fire were put to the
sword. 

Thus ended what the chronicles tell of as the War
of Fire, when men nearly brought ruin once more
to the world. 
~
E
history2~
This sundering of the Magic released cataclysmic
storms of magic over the surface of Avendar, which
changed and alteried all that they touched. Of the
god\@s new children, vast changes were wrought,
some for good, some for ill. The aelin were
granted flight, and the gift of keen reason. The
caldarans learned wisdom, and were turned from
the night. At the same time, the brutal srryn
were born, spawn of languid swamp and foul
hearts. Beneath the earth fled the shuddeni,
blind minions of pure darkness, driven mad, some
say, by a love of much knowledge. 

The centuries after the Sundering of Magic were
dark ones. It was not until some hundreds of
years that civilization began anew, with the proud
selin and their cities in the skies. Striving,
perhaps, for a memory of things past, they
collected the artifacts of the ancient slatharya,
and built cities that at least faintly echoed the
glories of ancient days. 

And so it was the selin waxed powerful, the
srryn confined to their torpid swamps and the
shuddeni to their caves, and all others brought
into alliance with them. For a time, it appeared the
world would never again know such a destruction,
until, at last, the gods allowed a new race to
awaken on Avendar - the humans. 

The humans were taken by any and all things,
some easily swayed to evil, others relentless
paragons of virtue. Some claimed them akin to
gods, others to devil-spawn of the Void, others
still to reckless children. Nevertheless, the
passion that drove the humans lead them, at first,
into a reckless alliance with the brutal srryn. 
~
E
history1~
In the beginning, were the gods. Some to create,
some to destroy, some to taint, others to bring
hope, others to simply be. The gods, though, were
alone in the universe. Seeking a canvas for their
essence, they created the world of Avendar.
And, edged along ever so carefully by the gods
of creation, they created the alatharya,
first children of the gods. 

To the alatharya, the gods gave their greatest
gift - Magic. Magic to create, magic to destroy,
some portion of each of the gods\@ essences was 
sent to swirl through the prime material, creating 
the ether, the Quintessence from which mages drew 
their power.

As time passed, the alatharya waxed mighty. The
gods, pleased, began plans for other creations,
each mighty in their own way. But the Alatharya
were not content with the god\@s plans to make
others - jealous of the thought that other
children might bring the god\@s attention away
from them, and coveting the Quintessence, they
sought to steal the power of the gods. With their
mighty pyramids, and strange rites, their priests
and scholars came together one fateful night for
a grand theft. In their hubris, they sought to
steal the power of the gods for themselves, and
make of themselves Creators. 

But, alas, it was not to be. The gods knew of the
theft, and instead of invoking the power of the
gods, they invoked their deepest and darkest
wrath. All across Avendar, the great cities of the
alatharya were rent in blood and fire - their
libraries burned, their pyramids turned to
rubble, their homes driven to the four winds. The
revenge of a god is not a small thing, and the
revenge of the combined might of a pantheon can
level entire worlds. So it was that the Alatharya
were cast from their pinnacle as the mightiest of
races. No more would the minds of the Alatharya
follow the intracies of magic - nor would the
Alatharya do nought than strive for balance in
their day to day life, fearful of retribution for
their ancient crime. And, lastly, the gods
sundered Magic from its pure form into its
elemental components. Water, Spirit, Wind, Fire,
Void, and Earth did it break them, and forever
shatter the mortal dream of attaining the divine
through mystic arts.

In the centuries following the War, the shuddeni took advantages of the
weakening of the human Republic to cultivate a more favorable attitude
toward them on the surface.  Still feared, some shuddeni became known for
their scholarly works, providing magical transportation across Avendar. 
Others cultivated their reputation as exotic bards, convincing noblemen of
the artistic merits of the bizarre shuddeni musical scales. 
  
In time, some shuddeni came to find permanent homes on the surface, still
mistrusted but accepted as a necessary evil in troubled times.  Below the
surface, some shuddeni still scheme, plotting a return of conquest, viewing
themselves as predestined rulers of Avendar.
~
E
book4~
The ch\@taren, desperate to escape perceived threat, broke through the
lines of the shuddeni, and fought their way to the surfaces with the aid of
human slaves.  Using the magics of spirit and their numbers, the ch\@taren
brought the War of Night to the swift end that the shuddeni had hoped for --
with a victory for the Republic and the forces of the light. 
  
The shuddeni were defeated, but still a threat.  Some shuddeni remained
in strongholds in the Brintors, proving too entrenched to easily removed
without considerable loss of life.  The main shuddeni tunnels to the surface
were walled off, preventing the easy passage of large bodies of shuddeni.
~
E
book3~
On the surface, srryn turned against the Republic, along with small
pockets of human rebellion, particularly among scholars.  The shuddeni
boiled to the surface, rapidly consolidating a foothold in the Brintors and
the northlands.  Once secure, the shuddeni conquest became a less rapid tide,
if seemingly just as certain. 
  
The humans and their allies began to fight in desperation, attempting at
least a holding action against the shuddeni.  The Republic\@s fortunes seemed
to be taking a turn for the worse, with each step forward followed by two
steps backward.  The shuddeni, though, were not content with a lengthy and
protracted war.  They were eager to take possession of a land not denuded by
the consequences of war.  They wanted a swift victory -- and took steps to
ensure it. 
  
Drawing together the greatest archmages of the void, the shuddeni sought
to create an immense nexus to the void.  The gateway was to open for three
days, to bring through and bind the largest and most powerful of demons, for
use in one final assault on Earendam.  The result of their Summoning,
however, was not what they intended.  Instead of an army of demons, they
brought through a great host of ch\@taren, refugees from an outer plane.
~
E
book2~
Human contact with the shuddeni occured in the years prior to the War of
Night, when mining expeditions in the Brintors revealed a passage to
Yithoul, one of the largest of the shuddeni cities.  After several initial
ventures there met their end, the shuddeni established a gradual
relationship with the Republic.
  
What the senate did not know was that these initial peace overtures were
merely the first step in a massive shuddeni campaign of conquest for the
surface world.  Extending their power to certain groups not in favor under
the policies of the Republic (Srryn and humans willing to practice forbidden
magic among them), the shuddeni began to ally themselves with these
factions.  
  
When the shuddeni burst to the surface, they brought with them their most
potent weapon -- the magic which drew on the negative energies of the void,
binding demons and horrific plagues.  The shuddeni had with them their
savage chaja slaves, who formed the bulk of their fighting forces, along
with their trained swordmasters, all wielding the dark blades of their kind.

{WTHE SHUDDENI{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
The shuddeni are a subterranean race, living in underground cities far
below the surface of Avendar.  Shuddeni appear as extremely thin humanoids
with ashen gray skin, absolutely lacking in all body hair.  Most distinctive
about the shuddeni, though, is the complete absence of eyes.  In the place
of the orbs of the eye, shuddeni have nothing but a slight indentation of
smooth flesh.  Rather than seeing in the conventional sense, the shuddeni
have some other way of detecting shape and essences. 
  
Most of shuddeni culture revolves around life in their cities, which were
originally formed by successful families, or Septs as they are now known, of
shuddeni.  In time, the holds of the Septs acommodated allies of the family,
until they eventually became large enough to sustain themselves independent.
  
Today, shuddeni cities are governed by a ruling caste of priests, who
maintain their power through the use of magic and command of the lion\@s
share of the city resources.  Shuddeni guard their cities with the aid of
the chaja, a race of massive slaves.  Shuddeni cities will occassionally
ally themselves with one another, but bloody disputes have been known to
erupt over matters of territory or itinerant raiding.

Ethron-
Potent warriors and hardy scholars, the ethron have proved
vexing foes in their forested homes. They are sly in the woods and
disappear without a trace. Perhaps we should burn down the forests
that they have nowhere to hide.
  
Humans-
I find humanity infuriatingly inconsistent. They are as likely
to serve us as willing slaves as to crusade against us
in a misguided attempt to end our race. If only there
was a way to divine the heart of a human, but such magic

Observations and Uses for the Lesser Races
  
Aelin-
Nobility and entitlement runs through their veins as surely
as darkness flows through ours. The aelin ooze this whether
they are in service to goodness or evil, making them thoroughly
insufferable to deal with in either case. They are skilled
diplomats, however, and perhaps we might make use of them in
this regard once they are properly tamed.
  
Alatharya-
The silver-skinned Alatharya have fallen from the grace of the gods
ages ago, and still bear the scars of it upon their minds. This
stupidity makes them useful tools of brutality, but their resistance
to partaking in true evil makes them poor slaves in comparison with
our Chaja.
  
Caladaran-
These peaceful scholars rise such bile in my throat. To think
of the power they might seize with the minds they were gifted with!
Yet, do they make slaves of the lesser races to compensate their
physical frailty? No! They co-exist with them as equals! Fools all;
let us chain them and force their minds toward our ends.
  
Chaja-
Stupid, ugly, simple things, our chaja. How perfectly they illustrate
the proper relationship between our race and others. Subservient.

the same neat, curling hand, as though someone copied everything out before
adding it to the collection.  The first page reads:

I was born Kald An\@athanatos, to Shinnann Tookrysen and Korus An\@athanatos. 
My father Korus was originally a simple tiller of the earth, growing wheat
and grapes in the fields surrounding Inessa.  He loves the growing things,
and will spend hours out among his crops and return well after dark,
smelling of fresh soil.  My mother, a healer of Inessa, dabbles in her trade
for the small and minor injuries recieved by the villagers in our lovely
town.  She is most fond of crushing and fermenting the grapes and other
berries my father grows to make delicate cordials, with which she sometimes
mixes her medicines.  My brother Luyan, twin to me in body and soul, is the
most dear person to me in all of the world...  We soon set out to travel the
lands, seeking to bring the light of faith and purity to all that we may
hope to touch with our own humble abilities and the divine aid of Our Lady.

\#Korus An\@athanatos is one of the more ephemeral figures in Avendarian
history, due to his sudden rise and disappearance in the \@adventuring
scene\@, as the younger in my profession call it.  His exploits are quite
difficult to track, due to his retiring, shy nature and his short period of
public life.  Such a brief span of time eliminates the ability to sort out
truth from rumor due to the fact that no pattern of behavior was
established.

When Korus was a relatively young man, shortly after receiving his allotment
of my great-grandfather\@s land, the emerald dragon (see -Wyrm-, -Drachen-,
or -Serpent-)(see also -Armor-), full of the hale and vigor of youth, roamed
the lands freely, indavertently causing chaos wherever it passed.  Korus, at
the will of his family and the others in his village, left Morn (see
-Forests-, -Inessa-) with the local militia to find the dragon and drive it
back.

When in the easy process of tracking the beast (following the massive swath
of charred wreckage), Korus met with Berakiel (the grandfather of Belarik
Smith: See -Belarik-, or -The Rock-)who first introduced him to the use of
the blade.  The young farmer quickly found that he had an innate skill with
the sword.  Rapidly gaining a reputation for tact and tenacity as a fighter
among the ragtag militia, he began to make infrastructural suggestions to
their putative leader, eventually reforming the unit into a well-knit,
cohesive body.

Several days passed, and it seemed as if they had made no
further progress on catching up to it.  Due to the peregrinous nature of
their wanderings, little is known about the succesion of the Dragon\@s
attacks: however, we can safely say that it traveled over a good deal of
Avendar, due to the dating of some unique wreckage.  (see -Dusk of the
Dragon-)

\#Finally, as the lands were encased in a shell of frigidity and snow began
to mask the dragon\@s tracks, they saw a massive pillar of smoke, towering to
the sky.  Day after day as they got closer they saw the eaves of the forest
Nendor(see -Forests-, -Eril-.  See also -Motive Trees-, -Flesh Saplings-)
were aflame.  They met with several other bands who also hunted the beast,
some professional mercenaries, some guardsmen, and some simple farmers like
K.  In an attempt to flush the wyrm out from the forest, where it could
dodge, strike, and run, wearing down the militiamen (see -Form of the
Dragon-, -Swordmaster-), the hunters had set fire to the forest, yet only
ended up providing a screen of heat and smoke for it to shelter behind.

Due to the beast\@s ferocious nature (?  See frenzy?)  , this also only
served to aggravate it further.  That very night, while most of the pursuers
slept, the fire burned low, still smouldering, but tolerable for the dragon.
Seizing the opportunity, it attacked, scattering the makeshift camp and
catching its inhabitants completely off guard.  Death cries of many tongues
reached to the heavens that night as the dragon took advantage of the dark
and cold to destroy most of the camp.

Korus, spared from the dragon through the help of Berakiel, seized up a long
pike dropped by a Kor Thrandian soldier (see -Pike-, -Kor Thrandir-,
-Vorinden Pass-.  See also -Shuddeni-).  As the beast reared to devour him,
Korus struck the beast in the neck, using its impetus to penetrate deep into
the dragon\@s flesh.  The pike-head snapped off, leaving the blessed head in
the wyrm\@s neck.  Greviously injured and burned by the sanctified metal, the
dragon fled into the trees.

Korus pursued, inflicting several minor wounds on the serpent with his
blade, and chased it to the brink of a cleft in the earth.  There they
fought, among the acrid fumes and glowing ash left by the spent inferno. 
Because of the terrible injury dealt to it, the beast was sorely weakened,
leveling the odds considerably.  After only a few minutes, the young
Ch\@taren (see -Ch\@taren-, -Day of Two Dawns-) was able to force the beast
backwards off the edge, where it slid into the darkness with a shriek of
rage.\#

\#Korus disappeared into anonymity for several years after his exploits
with the dragon.  It is a long-debated question, as to why he went off on
such a rant.  Some say that his family was killed by shuddeni, some say that
he wanted to see the world, and others, less enamored with his heroism, say
that he was an uncultured peasant with a taste for blood.  In the opinion of
this humble scribbler of history, he acquired a bent for the risk and danger
of living the life of a vigilante champion, drawing on his own ascetic inner
strength to sustain him.  

Even more highly questioned is -what- he actually did during the years
between meeting his wife (see Shinnann) and the episode with the dragon. 
Though there are no longer many existing records, a flurry of shuddeni
correspondence was found, mostly to those within the military, \@clergy\@, or
Assassins (mostly Nefortu)(see -Assassin-, -Red Hand-)- most of these
letters were, sadly, destroyed in the Library Fire decades ago.  

They all concern the threat of, I gather, a Ch\@taren swordmaster who almost
single-handedly penetrated deep into the heart of Yithoul (see Yithoul,
Temple of Yithoul) over a period of several months, going deeper and deeper
each time, until he broached the lower levels of the notorious catacombs
beneaths (see -Catacombs of Yithoul-....  Onyx?  Basalt?)  , where he fought
with some of the Older forces of evil the world has known, striking such
fear into the demons and beasts that all was quiet for quite some time after
his departure.

\#Yet at some point Korus met his match.  Sorely injured, scorched and
seared, he emerged from the smoke, finding his way back to the surface only
through luck and perhaps divine benevolence.  He was borne back to his home
with all possible speed by those \@hero-worshippers\@ who had followed him
about, hoping to gain might as well, but during the many days it took to
return he worsened even more.  

The healer of the town, a young woman by name of Shinnann (see Shinnann
(auth.  Note: little is known of this girl, short of her training in the
ways of the water scholar and failed training as a priestess of Rystaia (see
-Rystaia-, -Order of the Pegasus-, -Chosen-))), only recently finished her
apprenticeship, spent hours plying her craft on the torn, burnt shell that
was Korus the farmer.  Though she called upon the magics of water to heal
his body and her little knowledge of the spirit realm to cure his soul, not
all of the damage was reparable.  

In the standard maudlin way of things, after several weeks he had fallen in
love with his savior.  During the time of his recovery, regardless of the
truth or not, he was given the name Death to the Deathless: An\@athanatos. 
So popular it was that he eventually took it as his own.  This is Korus\@
only known vanity, his only deviation from his monk-like asceticism.\#

In coming to the tower, you have made a great step.  I am confident that 
each of you will find your place in the tower, and that you will use it to 
enforce our tenets.  Through the regimentalization of Aramril\@s forces, 
we will better be able to purify the world of dark influence.  It is the 
belief of this author that if you memorize this manual, adhere to its edicts, 
and do your best to enforce the tenets of Aramril, you will succeed as a 
Champion.  I bid you all well, and hope that you find happiness as a soldier 
of the light.

After both sides are heard, a formal vote will be taken as to the guilt or 
innocence of the accused party.  The Lord General does not receive a vote, 
but he or she may overrule any decision.  If the procedure is not 
completed as explained, the Council is considered a mistrial, and no 
action will be taken against the accused Champion.
  
By following the chain of command stringently, a semblance of order will 
be achieved.  Battles will be fought more smoothly; ambiguity amongst the 
ranks will be minimized.  It is expected that every Champion adhere to the 
rules regarding the chain of command.  To circumvent the chain of command 
is immediate grounds for disciplinary action.
~
E
codex7~
{WChapter 5 - The Chain of Command{n
                     --------------------------------
  
In order to be the efficient force that it is is, the Champions of Aramril 
must maintain a strict chain of command. Without this, there might be 
ambiguity as to what is to be done.  The resulting chaos might lead to 
defeat in battle.  To prevent this from happening, I will attempt to 
completely document how all militant actions should be carried out.  
  
An officer always carries out the commands of a superior officer.  A command 
may be questioned, but not publicly.  This should be done privately with the 
officer in question.  Regardless, commands are to be immediately carried 
out.  Officers are expected to consult their lesser ranked comrades, in hopes 
that an efficient plan of battle be formulated.  
  
Problems with a ranking officer should be forwarded to the General and 
the Chancellor.  This includes problems with commands that have been 
given. They may attempt to disregard the dispute, speak with the 
officer informally, or call a council of Champions.  The council of 
Champions is the most dire consequence of the three.  The decision to 
call council is the at the sole discretion of the General.  
  
A council of Champions is a formal affair; it is only used in the most 
dire of situations.  It is open to all Champions; all who are able to 
attend will be required to do so.  Firstly, the accused will testify
on his own behalf.  After that, he will be allowed to call witnesses
in his defense.  If the accusor is present, he will then be allowed to 
speak; if not, then the Lord General will present the case against the 
accused.
~
E

{WCHAPTER 4 - Common Military Courtesy{n
                   ------------------------------------
  
Custom and courtesty have both a place and a purpose in the order of Aramril. 
There are a few methods of address and ceremony that you will need to learn. 
You will be expected to adhere to these guidelines, as through them, you will 
convey respect to your fellow Champions.  Read this chapter, and learn well 
its contents.  If you do so, you will find your time in Aramril much more 
efficient.
  
Firstly, we will consider the salute.  The salute is the most basic kind 
of knightly courtesy.  It conveys the respect for the person that you are 
saluting.  A salute is initiated by the lower ranking officer; if the 
officers are of the same rank, either may initiate.  A salute should 
always be returned.  It is very disrespectful for an officer to receive a 
salute, and not give one in return.  To properly administer a salute, an
officer stands rigid. The officer then places the right hand to the left 
forearm, and the left hand to the right forearm.
  
Secondly, there is the matter of address.  You will address a superior 
officer by their rank.  Knight so-and-so, Paladin so-and-so, etc.  
Officers of the same rank are to address each other as Brother so-and-so or 
Sister so-and-so, in front of Champions of the lower ranks.  Privately, 
they may address each other by name.  Higher ranked officers may address 
those of lower rank by name, though the title brother or sister is 
always considered more respectful.  Also, you may answer officers of a 
superior rank with the respectful titles \#Sir\# and \#Ma\@am\#.  
  
As was previously stated, these guidelines are just that:  guidelines.  In 
times of battle, or in situations that might be perilous, some or all of 
these formalities may be dispensed with.  It is expected that a Champion 
of Aramril will have the good sense to know when this be the case.  Through 
these measures, it is hoped that we might come to love and respect one 
another to an even higher degree.

{WCHAPTER 3 - Behavior Suggestions for Each Rank{n
             ----------------------------------------------
  
Behaviour of the Ranks:
  
{YNovice{n: 
  
Novices are expected to spend much of their time in meditation about the 
tenets of Aramril, and in service to their brethren, following the orders 
of their commanding Knight and other authorities within the Tower, within
reason.  To be a novice is to reflect upon what it is to be a Champion of 
the Light, and what the future holds.
  
{YKnight{n:
  
To be a Knight of the Champions is to know what one should be doing and 
how one will best serve in the current situation.  Instead of meditation, 
a Knight should always be out of the Tower, and in amongst the general
populace, doing the good works of the Champions.  However, the Tower,
as always, serves as a refuge for when the Knight requires rest or 
protection.
  
{YPaladin{n: 
  
A Paladin of the Champions is always working to coordinate and direct the 
works of the Knights and Novices below him.  He may spend more time in the 
tower, working on plans and giving reports to the Chancellor and the High
General, but he will also perform all the duties of a Knight as he is able 
to.  Paladins are those who walk on the path of Righteousness, with little 
or no error.
  
{YChancellor{n: 
The Chancellor, being the highest ranked Champion appointed by a mortal, 
is held to the highest standard.  His assistance is always given to the 
High General, and his works to monitor and deal with matters takes high 
priority.  He aids the High General as his closest and most trusted 
advisor, and is often known for his great wisdom and clarity of vision.
  
{YHigh General{n: 
The Champion of the Champions, the person chosen for this responsibility 
must not walk the path of righteousness, but walk a path so narrow it 
would thread a needle.  He is, naturally, the role model of
the Champions.
~
E
codex4~
The title of Paladin is bestowed upon those directly under the command of 
the Chancellor.  They act as tacticians, formulating plans of battle, and 
seeing that they are acted out properly.  Paladins are generally very 
knowledgable adventurers.  A Paladin must be a good leader, as he or she 
will be called on to lead soldiers into battle.
  
A Knight is a Champion who has proven his or her mettle.  He or she has 
either been a novice for a long time, or has distinguished himself in some 
way.  The Knight is considered the most common type of soldier in the 
order they make up the backbone of Aramril\@s army.  Knights are capable 
leaders; in the event that a Paladin is not present to act thusly, they 
will do so.  As a Knight, one is expected to demonstrate the tenets of Aramril 
superbly.
  
The lowest rank in the tower is that of Novice.  The Novice is generally a 
new Champion.  Novices are directly under the command of the more 
experienced Knights; he or she has generally demonstrated his knowledge of 
the tenets, but has not borne the burden of time, or distinguished his or 
her self in some way.  Novices hearken: though you are the least 
experienced of the order, you are in no way insignifigant.  As a Champion 
of Avendar, you have found fellowship.
~
E
codex3~
{WCHAPTER 2 - Structure of the Champions{n
                --------------------------------------
The Champions are divided into several ranks.  These ranks are instituted 
in order that a chain of command be established.  The chain of command 
will be detailed in the next chapter.  Each position has its own 
responsibilities.  In this chapter, I will attempt to detail them.  It 
should be noted that guild standing has little to do with what position 
one attains.  Rank is attained only through merit.  
    
The highest mortal power in Aramril is that of the Lord General. The 
Lord General is chosen by a deity of the light; generally this would be 
Jolinn.  The General\@s word is law.
    
 When it comes to the conflicts that arise in the tower, the General is 
the final arbiter.  He or she oversees the overall direction in which the 
house will go.  The General is responsible for inducting new members, as well
 as giving them positions within the order.  The General is also responsible 
for maintaining relations with other houses.
  
The Chancellor is the General\@s most trusted advisor.  He or she is 
generally well respected and quite a tactician.  It\@s his or her job to aid 
the General in making the various decisions that affect the internal state 
of the tower.  Disputes amongst ranking officers are to be forwarded to the 
Chancellor, as well as the General.  It should be noted that the 
Chancellor is the highest power appointed by a mortal, in the tower.
~

{WChapter 1 - Aramril\@s Purpose{n
                       -----------------------------
Hello, adventurer.  You\@ve been honored with the opportunity to serve the 
light as a Champion of the Light.  As a Champion, you will be based in the 
Tower of Aramril.  In the tower you\@ll find fellowship with brothers and 
sisters of the same mindset.  The tower stands as a bastion against the 
darkness that threatens the world.
  
Your purpose in the tower is to carry out Aramril\@s tenets.  You\@re to see
that justice is served, mercy is granted, and courage never falters.  As 
you are a Champion, so are you marked out;  there will be those that hunt 
you simply because you are who you are.  Still, so long as you honor your 
oath, and enforce the tenets, Aramril will always offer you refuge.
  
The order of Aramril is a militant one; as all military orders, it has 
its structure and regulations.  I have compiled this manual in an attempt
to convey this information to you.  Read it and understand its content, 
for along with the the three tenets and the three commandments, this 
information forms the basis for the Champions of the Light.

 higher status in this sept than in the others. They tend to wear clothes
 woven of chaja-hair, or chaja hide. Most looked down upon by the other
 septs. It was learned that they wished to draw the the titans from their
 secluded neutrality in the White Castle, so that they might raid the castle
 and free Xthjich (and with his favor, completely dominate the other septs).

Notes on the Known Shuddeni Septs
  
 Aside from the well-known Yithoul, three other septs of Shuddeni 
 participated in the recent \#Scourge War\#. According to intelligence
 reports, the Addaash and Ksatha septs were the most eager to begin
 the war, with Yithoul and Ttou going along reluctantly. The political
 manuevering for leadership in the war was extreme, and perhaps more
 than any organized actions of the surface alliance, accounted for the
 failure of the Scourge to dominate to the degrees of the War of Night.

 See subsequent pages for notes on each sept.

There are two tales told of the Anaiama Crystals.  Both come from stories
and legends surrounding the War of Night.  Which, if either, is true, is a
matter of some debate.  

The first tale holds that the crystals were a sign from the gods of light to
the ch\@taren, that they should build a haven on Alensha.  It is said that
shortly after the war, as the ch\@taren hosts dispersed and some sought to
find havens, that a ch\@taren spiritlord came to Alensha.  At that time, a
few solitary caladaran dwelt on the island, shepherding their duskin flocks.
The caladaran shepherds had never seen a ch\@taren before, and were
astonished at the sight of the translucent, golden figure.  

On the banks of the Ilrel, where the river sweeps down the steep slopes and
into the sea, they gathered around the spiritlord.  He told them of the war
and the coming of the ch\@taren.  The spiritlord also spoke of the ch\@taren
home plane, and related the tale of Rystaia and Vaialos.  As he spoke of the
twin deities, two crystals suddenly emerged, glowing, in the Ilrel flow.  

The spiritlord and the caladaran took this as a sign from the deities of
light.  This seemed an omen that the island was the place meant for a
ch\@taren haven.  And so many ch\@taren came, and with the aid of others,
raised the city of Jh\@ten.  
~
E
book2~
The second tale is the story of Hinar and Aerell, the tragic story of the
first romance between a human and ch\@taren.  It is said that Hinar, a young
Salyran scholar, supported the ch\@taren host as a healer during the final
battles of the war.  She was admired by the ch\@taren she served, for her
kindness and skill as well as her unusual human beauty.  

It so happened that a wounded ch\@taren templar, Aerell, came under her care.
Between them a love gradually blossomed.  For a time they were very happy,
as happy as such a pair could be in days of war.  Aerell found her heart to
be beautiful as well, and good, almost in the way of his own people.  

A former lover of Hinar, a griffinrider named Tinirth, had been among the
foremost of the resistors of Shuddeni rule before the ch\@taren came.  He
found himself growing bitter, feeling a loss of prestige and importance when
the ch\@taren came and turned the course the war, and took with Hilar with
them.  Shuddeni agents learned of Tinirth\@s feelings, and were able to build
resentment and animosity, until such feelings became an obsession.  

After the war, Tinirth followed Hinar and Aerell to Alensha.  He found them
on the banks of the Ilrel, slew them both, and cast their bodies into the
waters, to be washed out to sea.  However, their bodies were transformed in
the water.  Hinar became a crystal of deep blue, and Aerell, a crystal of
gold.  The gods of light had, in their mercy, made it so that Hinar and
Aerell would always be together.  

Regardless of whether either tale is true, it is a fact that in the years
since the war, many followers of the deities of light come to Alensha on
pilgrimage, as it is said that the crystals have the power to mend wounds of
the heart.  They come to see and touch the stones and seek healing.

DICE THROUGH THE AGES: THREE EARLY DICE GAMES

Phos (Pig)
----------

Rules: Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1
is rolled or the player holds and scores the sum of the rolls (i.e.
the turn total). At any time during a player\@s turn, the player
is faced with two options:
  
  * roll - If the player rolls a ....

             1:   the player scores nothing and it becomes the next
                  player\@s turn.

             2-6: the number is added to the player\@s turn total and
                  the player\@s turn continues.

  * hold - The turn total is added to the player\@s score and it becomes
           the next player\@s turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

Phos origins: Aelin or earlier. Mostly associated with young aelin nobles.
Many laws were passed centers of aelin culture against the game, but few
were successfully enforced.


Ilii (Threes)
-------------

Rules: Players gather in a circle with five dice. To establish who 
plays first, each player rolls one dice. The highest roll is given
the first turn. In the event of a tie roll, the tying players. This
is done until each player\@s place in the turn order is determined.

Each player throws an equal ante amount into the middle of the circle,
usually 5 gold pieces or an item of equivalent or higher worth, and then
players take their turn according to their initial rolls.

The object of the game is to achieve the lowest total score after adding
up the values of all five dice, counting threes as zeroes.

A player rolls all five dice and decides which ones to keep. The player
can keep as many as he or she wishes, but must keep at least one die each
roll. Once a die has been kept, it is out of play for the rest of the turn.
This means that a player can have at most five rolls in a turn.

In the event of a tie, the players who tie throw in an additional ante, 
equal to the initial ante, and enter a roll-off.

The player that wins the round takes all of the coins or items and a
new round starts, with the winner rolling first.

Origins note - Nefortu Tradition of Ajmayam: If a cheater can win the 
game and collect the pot before the cheating is discovered, the cheater is
\#ajmayam\# and allowed to keep the pot (and is admired for her cleverness).
If a cheater is discovered during  the game, however, he is required to add
another ante to the pot and is booted from the game (becoming the target
of much ridicule).


Ti Sa (Pot Bones)
-----------------
  
Each player has a die. Each predicts the roll of his own die and the other
players\@ dice. The dice are rolled, and the sum of the dice is compared to
the sum of each player\@s prediction. The player whose prediction is closest
to the total wins. 

In the case of a tie, all players roll again.

Origins note - This game was played in early srryn culture, often when a 
communal meal would finish and the srryn would begin squabbling over the
bones left in the pot. It was one way a lucky younger or weaker srryn could
have a chance to get some food, as they would have been pushed aside during
the meal itself.  If a dominant srryn wished to challenge the winner\@s claim
to the bones  (in whatever fashion, usually violently) he could do so, but
by tradition all others would side against the challenger.

tome2~
AFTER the final of the great campaigns of the War of Night, when the
shuddeni had at last been driven back into the deepest recesses of the
under-earth, the ch\@taren and their allies came to realize a basic fact:
the ch\@taren were homeless in Avendar.  During the conflict, they had
stayed with and battled side by side with their human, aelin, ethron,
and  caladaran allies, but when the conflict ended this arrangement
seemed likewise to need an end--for even the greatest guests are likely
to eventually outwear their welcomes.

THIS was not an immediate concern for the ch\@taren themselves, as they
felt little inclination to settle.  Why this is so is a subject of debate,
for they remembered well the great cities built with the Art of Availlae
in their home plane.  But in Avendar, the homing instinct, the need to claim
territory and raise permanent shelters, was weaker within them, as was the
Art of Availlae itself.  In the weeks immediately after the Battle of the
Thrandir Caves, with the shuddeni threat seeming ended, the ch\@taren
gradually dispersed.  Travelling alone or in friend or kin groups, the
ch\@taren adopted a wandering lifestyle and spread throughout the land.

AFTER a few short years of wandering, however, the elders and sages among
the ch\@taren began to see a need for places of gathering, places where
ch\@taren could go for refuge and safety when necessary, places where
ch\@taren could meet with ch\@taren to bear and raise a new generation.
Also needed were places where the remaining lore, relics, and artifacts
from their homeworld could be stored and safeguarded.  And so, with
consultation from their allies of the war, particularly the great archmagi
of water with whom they had been allied so closely during the war, three
places were chosen, which came to be known as the Three Havens.  Using
what little of the Art of Availlae that they could draw upon in this plane,
and being supported by the native water and earth magi in their workings,
the ch\@taren made their havens.
~
E
tome3~
THE first was the haven of the waves.  On the remote island of Alensha, a
city with walls of white marble streaked with ch\@lonin was created.  It came
to be known as Jh\@ten.  Water scholars fashioned an amazing aqueduct system
in the city which still has no equal.  The second was the haven of the ice. 
In the far north, the settlement of Avayn was established, carved from the
base of a mighty glacier and protected from the chill of ice by water
scholars.  It remains the most purely ch\@taren of all places in Avendar, and
is the repository of most relics and artifacts from the ch\@taren homeworld. 
The third was the haven of the wind.  In the Broken Lands to the far east of
Earendam, Ad\@masteisa, a city of ch\@lonin- streaked terraces and graceful
ledge dwellings, was fashioned from the stone of a mountain face.  

THERE were rumors of a fourth haven as well, a hidden haven where the
greatest artifacts of the ch\@taren plane were secreted (though this is
generally denied by the Spiritlords, and has remained undiscovered, if it
actually exists).  

ONLY a decade had passed after the construction of the havens when the
shuddeni raised a final insurgence, seeking to break from the Thrandir
Caverns where they had been cornered.  The shuddeni warmasters had,
through nefortu spies, learned of the Havens and determined to claim
Ad\@masteisa, the cliff-city, as the rumors of tunnels into mount Rimora
made it a promising shuddeni stronghold.
~
E
tome4~
AND so they left the Caverns through secret, newly-tunneled routes and in
a single night came on demon-back and demon-wing to Ad\@masteisa, where the
unprepared folk could mount little resistance before they fell.  However,
the shuddeni soon learned that their spies had greatly exaggerated the depth
and extend of tunnels into Rimora.  As the old allies of light banded
together again and made their way through the broken lands to Ad\@masteisa,
the shuddeni forces scattered, abandoning the ruins of the haven and fleeing
back to the darkness of their deepest ancestral caverns.  

THE remaining havens are little like the cities of other mortals.   After
the destruction of Ad\@masteisa, each raised towers (called sy\@ceera) to
detect void magics and provide the first defense against them.  Also,
the citizenry is highly transient--the dwellings empty and fill as the
ch\@taren come and go, following their carefree and wandering lifestyle.
Few ch\@taren reside in the city permanently, though the elderly are more
apt to settle than ch\@taren youth, and provide the stability and leadership
needed in any society. A few goodly folk of other races have been allowed
to settle in the havens, and their numbers have slowly grown over the years
significantly adding to the stability of the haven societies.

MOST ch\@taren trained in the templar arts will, at some point during their
residence in a haven, volunteer to serve as a Warder.  The Warders make up
an informal watch, providing a measure of security to ch\@taren and
non-ch\@taren inhabitants against mischief. A select group of Warders (again,
often the more elderly) in each haven make up the elect group known as
Spiritlords.  The Spiritlords see to the defense of the haven, man the
sy\@ceera, and safeguard the oldest surviving ch\@taren relics and lore.

Scuffle Dice
  
This game, a favorite of the nefortu, blends gambling, drinking, and 
fighting. The two players pre-determine a coin type (silver, gold, etc),
then each rolls a pair of dice. The various results have these 
traditional names and attack or defense designations:

 1 - dodge   (D)               
 2 - dagger  (A)
 3 - sword   (A)
 4 - parry   (D)
 5 - shield  (D)
 6 - flail   (A)
  
Results:
  
 AA - AA  - highest dice sum wins the difference of the sums
 DD - DD  - lowest dice sum wins the difference of the sums
 DD - AA  - Drink of the alcohol of choice. If both drink, no coins are
            won. If neither are able to drink further, no coins are won
            (and usually the game is considered over, as one or both 
            players may not be conscious). If one can drink and the other
            can\@t, the drinker wins 3 coins.
 DD - AD  - AD wins 1 coin
 AA - AD  - AD wins 1 coin
 AD - AD  - Fight till one opponent begs mercy. The winner gets 5 coins.
  
Examples:
  
 X rolls 1 and 4 (DD), Y rolls 3 and 4 (AD) = Y wins 1 coin.
 X rolls 6 and 6 (AA), Y rolls 1 and 2 (AD) = Y wins 1.
 X rolls 4 and 5 (DD), Y rolls 1 and 5 (DD) = Y wins 3.
 X rolls 4 and 4 (DD), Y rolls 2 and 3 (AA) = Both can drink. No coins won.
 X rolls 4 and 4 (DD), Y rolls 2 and 3 (AA) = Both can\@t drink. No coins won.
 X rolls 2 and 6 (AA), Y rolls 4 and 5 (DD) = X drinks, Y can\@t. X wins 3.
 X rolls 2 and 3 (AA), Y rolls 3 and 6 (AA) = Y wins 4.
 X rolls 1 and 2 (AD), Y rolls 2 and 5 (AD) = Fight and X wins, X wins 5.

Years later, when his own life reached its end, his students looked up from
his deathbed.  

Where there had been one voice there was now two.  
~
E
tome23~
{WChapter Ten{x

That day, the north of Earendam burned.  The horde and Rjaar were decimated
and slain, but the city had suffered grevious wounds.  Centuries old
institutions had fallen into rubble, and the stink of the dying filled the
streets.  

For Elspa, the city was now a barren place.  Rather than leaving the city,
though, he built a shrine to his magic, with the aid of the grateful people
of Avendar.  
~
E
tome22~
While his love\@s killers had been slain, the seraph had vanished after
its task of vengenace was complete.  

The remaining shuddeni had rallied to the device, which was now pulsing with
a deep black light.  Mad with grief, he looked at Alaria one last time. 
With disbelief, he saw her last spirit stone had returned to his hand - one
last, affinity, perhaps for what had been hers.  

Crumbling the stones, he channeled the mana - and what he did with it was
something never done before.  

He drew the energy into him, and instead of discharging it as a bolt, he
became the energy.  The avatar of all the magics of spirit, his body was no
longer even flesh - a pale wash wash of blue energy, he ground his way
through the enemies\@ - holy power severing everything evil, ripping shuddeni
limbs from bodies - tossing Kankorans like rag dolls, and only when the
infernal device was gone did the spell\@s magic end, and he collapsed,
gasping for air, to the ground.  

~
E
tome21~
Supported by no less than four shuddeni scholars, the massive scholar
took bolt after bolt.  Finally, with Alaria gasping for breath, the
elemental crumbled into dust.  

Elspa leaned to signal affirmation to her, but his smile collapsed into a
tortured yell as he saw the shuddeni swordmaster come behind her.  Striking
with at her chest with a cruel blow, she fell to the ground, golden body
slashed and battered.  

Elspa raced to the body, but found himself surrounded by shuddeni.  Hoping
only to join his beloved, he raised his staff defensively, mind nearly
exhausted.  

The shuddeni closed in, sensing weakness.  

What they found, though, was beyond their wildest expectations.  Rising from
the body of Alaria was a golden seraph, wings of light with a sword of
flame, striking at them with wild abandon.  

Elspa could not watch as the seraph destroyed the shuddeni - he could only
hold Alaria\@s body and see the scene of her death reflected over and over
again.  
~
E
tome20~
Blocking his mind from the fear spells of the shuddeni with a mental
shell, he blocked one void scholar from his spellcasting, and tainted the
flow of magic to another with sharp stabs of light.  

Alaria, however, had no such focus - instead, she drew on her dwindling
supply of spirit stones.  

One of the shuddeni raised his arms, calling forth a giant elemental out of
the ground.  Alaria turned to spiritwrack it, but the spell fizzled on the
great thing, which was busy pounding away at the Kor Thrandians.  

Elspa shouted to her \#Alaria!  It doesn\@t have a soul!\#  

Nodding, Alaria drew deep within herself - rather than striking at the soul
of her opponent, she drew her own life force into a bolt of pure energy, and
blasted away at the golem.  
~
E
tome19~
Alaria raised a shield to protect against the magics of void about them,
and they charged swiftly into combat.  Letting slip with bolts of pure
energy, they tore into the souls of the shuddeni they faced, blasting them
back toward their eldritch device.  Although unsuspecting of the attack, the
shuddeni and kankorans reformed their lines, hacking viciously at the
men-at-arms they drew close to them.  

Elspa and Alaria cut through the lines, dropping visions of damnation onto
the wolf-men, and subduing the battle-crazed berserkers.  With luck and the
skill of their companions, they and some ten of the Kor Thrandians broke
through the lines and approached the device.  

Running low on mana, Elspa found himself drawing power from a source
unsuspected - his father\@s signet ring!  For so long had he kept it near
him, it now served as a focus for his power, allowing him to draw more than
he though possibly into his spells.  
~
E
tome18~
On the east wall, Elspa, Alaria, and the archers were making a daring
effort.  

Clambering down the wall like many of the other sortie parties, they struck
for the east flank of the army.  

There, hidden under a cloak of invisibility, were the scattered shuddeni
remnants which had supplied the kankorans with enchanted weapons and
protective spells.  

Now, the shuddeni were hurriedly constructing a strange artifact, surrounded
by the east flank of the horde.  

Touching their hands to the heads of the men from Kor Thrandir, Elspa and
Alaria fed every hope, every dream they could muster into driving them to a
zealous frenzy.  

For their part, the men of Kor Thrandir were if anything bred in their
opposition to the shuddeni, and were more than eager to put paid to their
hereditary enemies.  
~
E
tome17~
{WChapter Nine{x

Dawn broke over Earendam with a warcry.  

The red kankorans were lead by Rjaal Kalas, a sinister wolf-man who had
fought his way to the top of his people by every conceivably atrocity. 
Uniting a series of already bloodthirsty Kankoran tribes, Rjaal became
Thane, and lead his people across the Uthlin to bring a bloodshed not seen
in this part of the world for quite some time.  

Now, at the height of his power, Rjaal had brought his horde to the very
gates of Earendam.  A sea of red fur, axes, maces and spears, the horde
approached the north wall in a rush, heedless of loss of life or limb.  

Archers let loose with a sea of arrows, but the tide of bodies kept coming
remorselessly at the wall.  

Heaving an enormous battering ram, the Kankorans begin hammering away at
Earendam\@s gates, trying to batter their way into the great city.  
~
E
tome16~
Marching into Earendam, whose northern half was now filled with the
remnants of the Republic\@s troops that had made their way back to the city,
Elspa realized the depths of their predicament.  The city looked as if it
might survive the barbarians, but a full scale shuddeni war party?  

That night, atop the walls of the city, Elspa and Alaria were wed. 
Exchanging vows, they knitted their life forces together, using the magic
that had served them so well for this last affirmation of love.  

\#If our plan is to work, Alaria...  We can\@t rely on the masses of military
light.  Everything we do - everything has to matter.  Everything has to be
done right.\#  
~
E
tome15~
{WChapter Eight{x

At dawn the next day, Elspa, Alaria, and one hundred Kor Thrandian
men-at-arms marched out of the gates.  

The sergeant looked at his men, and said.  

\#Well, it\@s going to be a hard march past enemy lines.  But if we force
march, we should be there before the..\#  

\#No need!\#  Said Elspa with a grin.  

\#Gather around in a circle, captain.\#  

Used to the ways of mages, the sergeant obeyed without questioning exactly
what would happen, perhaps expecting the wind to sweep them to Earendam, or
to travel through a puddle.  What he saw he was completely unprepared for. 


With a \#whoosh!\#  Of imploding air, they popped out of existence by Kor
Thrandir and outside the north gate of Earendam.  

Staggered, the soldiers looked about in disbelief.  

Now it was Alaria\@s turn to grin.  \#And they said the wheel was a good
idea....\#  
~
E
tome14~
\#Protecting this keep is my sacred duty.  Twenty generations have guarded
it without fail.  I have sworn that no shuddeni will pass.\#  

\#My lord, can\@t you see?  Why not let the water scholars scry?  Let me teach
astral travel to one of your spirit mages...\#  

\#We have been unable to scry the Shuddeni for the past six months.  \#

\#What do you mean, unable to scry?\#  

\#Some new sorcery, perhaps.  An ill configuration of the stars, says Loril. 
I\@m sorry, Elspa, but without more evidence....\#  

Elspa pounded his fist on the table.  

\#Are you blind?  The shuddeni are helping the barbarians!  If you sit and do
nothing, the Republic will fall!\#  

Valis looked at Elspa and the shockingly beautiful Ch\@taren women beside
him.  The Ch\@taren were their staunchiest allies, and if this one found this
man compelling...  

\#I cannot bring the army, Elspa.  But...  The men who are not on watch the
next day or so.  Ask among them.  Those who wish to volunteer can go.  I
know the barbarians will reach Earendam in a day or two\@s time.  That much,
at least, I owe the Republic.\#  
~
E
tome13~
{WChapter Seven{x

The next day, Elspa left a small ruby in the sand outside Earendam.  Marking
it with a rune learned from the writings of Alaria\@s people, he linked
himself to the place, preparing for a journey.  

He and Alaria took off for Kor Thrandir, moving through the air using
borrowed wands from their friends the illusionists.  Moving into the
Brintors, taking less than two days to reach Kor Thrandir.  

The Lord Protector was skeptical of their claims.  

\#Shuddeni?  Attack Earendam?  They\@ll have to get through me, first!\#  

\#Lord Valis, they aren\@t going to go through the surface - they don\@t have
the military might to go through the seal.  They\@ve built..  Some...  Some
sort of nexus, and they\@re going to use it to join their barbarian allies on
the surface - when they attack Earendam in two days time!\#  

Valis looked at him skeptically.  

\#Even if this were true, what would you have me do?\#  

Elspa looked straight into Valis\@ eyes.  \#Bring your army to Earendam, sir. 
Or the city will fall in three days time.\#  
~
E
tome12~
Elspa, though, was troubled by Earendam\@s complacency toward the shuddeni
- secure in the knowledge that Kor Thrandir would keep the Shuddeni down in
force, and no more than scatter pockets could come to the surface through
other means.  

One night, realizing what they had to do, they both left their bodies and
descended into the bowels of the earth.  Heading to the nearby city of
Yithoul, they evaded the watchful eyestalks of the Shuddeni beasts which
could glimpse even into the astral plan, and slipped into the temple.  

There, they watched the rituals of the shuddeni, following the high priests
into their studies.  With long hours of looking at the plans, Elspa snapped
back to his body with a shock.  

\#They not going to going to attack Kor Thrandir, Alaria.  They\@re going to
Earendam!\#  
~
E
tome11~
{WChapter Six{x

Alaria and Elspa fell madly in love.  Both naturally gited with
communication with the spirits, they spent their days teaching each other
the magical tricks they\@d each learned.  Alaria taught Elspa about the
spirit stones she made her living with - crystals imbued with magical
essence, used as receptacles by mages to quickly cast their spells.  

In return, Elspa offered to share mana with her, sharing their most intimate
grasp on the structure of life itself.  

Most of all though, they learned more and more about their ability to speak
in dreams.  Almost as an extension of this power, they learned that their
souls could not only wander the dream realm - they could actually leave
their bodies!  

Wandering in the astral never-neverland and the borders of reality, they saw
the barbarian hordes, and the battles fought by the armies of the Republic. 
Scattered and defeated, they saw the fingers of Earendam\@s influence pull
back from across the Brintors, withdrawing to a few scattered villages on
the Arien.  

More troubling, they saw that the Senate and the Patrician knew of aid the
Shuddeni had been giving the barbarians, but seemed to have no inkling where
the threads had lead them.  Kor Thrandir still protected the main shuddeni
route to the surface, and the shuddeni\@s numbers were still decimated from
the war.  Known for their slow breeding and careful plotting, the world
might well see another five centuries before the shuddeni acted in force on
the surface again - or so conventional wisdom indicated.  
~
E
tome10~
And yet there was another presence that walked the city of his dreams,
and it seemed to share his concerns over the fate of the city.  He would see
a figure walking the streets, that would vanish just as he turned a corner. 
A faint flash of light, on a corner.  At first he only felt the worry of
this other figure, but eventually it was as if he could detect words - words
reaching a crescendo each night, until he could bear it no more: \#Meet me at
south Tyril Square\# 

The next day, he awoke, picked up his things, and left the key to his room
at the inn with the innkeep.  

He went to the square, and spent the day watching the illusionists and bards
there.  Amidst the crowd, he could soothe his own feelings by immersing
himself in what the crowd felt - wonder at the illusionists from the Silver
Griffin, and hope.  In truth, he didn\@t know what he expected to find there,
and, as the sun began to set, he felt he had made a mistake.  

Truding out of the square, he nearly tripped over a ch\@taren woman, lost in
thought herself.  

Scintillating gold skin covered her spare frame, wrapped in robes of deep
gold.  Looking up at him, a light came into her eyes, and she mouthed one
word.  

\#You\#
~
E
tome9~
Elspa eventually reached Earendam the grand, and came in through the
north gate and onto Tyril Square.  Taking lodging in an inn on Cetilin Way,
he spent his time offering his services to those who needed them,earning the
gold to keep his lodging.  Traders sought him out for his ability to know
the hearts of men,and several times his services were used by the healers to
awaken those who lay in magically induced comas.  

Outside the great capitol, guardsmen brought more word of the most violent
of the kankoran tribes raiding Earendam\@s trade routes.  The decline of the
Republic which had begun with the articles of independence of Var Bandor and
Ashta Harrud several hundred years ago began to accelerate.  Fragile
alliances sprang up and fell over night, as the roads and rivers became less
safe.  The senate had warned that Earendam had overextended itself in
protecting outlying provinces, but the patrician had ordered it, citing the
titular responsibility of Earendam for its vassals.  

In the midst of this was Elspa, content, perhaps, in his meditations to let
the world slip by, doing some small part to aid the people of the city, and
yet lost to his actual role.  

As he slept each night, however, he began to have the same dream - he walked
the streets of Earendam, but its citizens had vanished.  Its towers layed
ruined, its walls breached - all in the pattern of the newly come
barbarians.  But the absence that echoed through the streets was not the
natural pattern even for such brutality - everywhere, there was a sense of
dread.  Of ...  Decay.  
~
E
tome8~
{WChapter Five{x

As Elspa grew closer to Earendam, he came to realize that not everything was
right in the capitol of the Republic.  Villages had been abandoned, or the
occasional field was scorched bare.  The spirits told him of barbarian
raids, attacking the fragmented and overextending holdings of the Republic. 
Most spoke of red-furred Kankorans from the other side of the Uthlin, or the
other side of the Brintors.  More alarmingly, the occasional lone shade
spoke of chaja seen amidst the wolf-men.  

Elspa was troubled by this news.  Near seven hundred years previously, the
chaja and their eyeless masters were defeated in the War of Endless Night. 
Still, the chaja and shuddeni were supposed to be gone - and there had been
Dalith\@s reference to an eyeless one.  

What was transpiring in the world?
~
E

{WChapter Four{x

Following Dalith to the loft, Elspa saw his brother, wasted and mad.  He
seemed to lack the strength to move, but he still twitched nervously at
everything in the room.  As Elpsa approached, he began to froth at the
mouth, trying franatically to get away from him, even gathering the strength
to stand up and begin darting about the room 

Elspa looked at him, and in a moment could see the pain in the man.  The
pain - and the fear.  \#It\@s..  It\@s ok, Stila\# 

Filling the room with his inner stability, Elspa calmed the madman down.  He
no longer jerked about, but his eyes still shone with the madness.  

Putting his hand to Stila\@s head, Elspa met his gaze.  

\#Think of your soul, Stila.  Think of this as...  As a dark knot in it,
twisting everything good and right away from you.  We\@re going to undo the
spell that made that knot..  And we\@re going to give you clarity.  So..  So
you can see the light from the dark\# 

Slowly, Stila closed his eyes.  Elspa concentrated for a minute or two more,
and when Stila looked around him, tears streamed down his cheeks, and he
stood in wonder.  

\#Thank you\#, he said, in a voice that croaked.  

Elspa crept down the loft\@s ladder, leaving the two brothers to a tear
filled reunion.  
~
E
tome6~
Tending to the solitude of the barn, Elspa heard an odd moaning from the
loft as he worked, and at dinner, he asked Dalith what was the source of the
sound.  

Growing quiet for a moment, Dalith seemed a bit taken aback.  

\#Well, that\@s me brother Stila.  He ain\@t been right ever since the shuddeni
near took his head off on one of their raids.  One of those devils pointed
at him, and he ran screaming.  After that...\#  

Elspa looked thoughtful for a moment, and said slowly, 

\#I think I can help him.\#  

Dalith\@s head jerked up.  \#What, ye one of those devils after all!\#  

\#No - gods no, not like that.  I...  I think I can heal his mind.\#  

Looking doubtful, Dalith scratched his head.  \#That...  That water scholar
from the city that does free work was here.  He said there warn\@t nothing he
could do\# 

Elspa looked up with a grin.  

\#You might say I work on a different plane.\#

{WChapter Three{x

Elspa wandered the Arien plains, traveling far north to the Brintors,
passing through ancient valleys and even passing through the fabled tower of
Shaendar.  In time, though, he tired of his isolation and turned again to
the ways of man.  

In the silence of his meditation, he had come to master more of his
self-taught art.  Passing the time in silence, he had learned to channel the
mana used by scholars easily and effectively - his meditative techniques
coming in handy for filling his body with what he felt was the lifeblood of
the universe itself.  

Passing back toward Earendam, he was put up in a small village of farmers,
who were wary initially at his presence.  \#You ain\@t a mollie, are ya?\#  

\#A what?\#  Stammered Elspa.  

\#Dalith, don\@t be a damned fool, the boys got eyes, can\@t ya see?  And his
skin ain\@t all wrinkly!\#  Called out the man\@s wife.  

After some confusion, Elspa announced that no, he was not a shuddeni, and
yes, he would clean out the stable for the night\@s rest and a hearty meal.  
~

The years passed, and Agjar grew more and more depraved.  With his
fortunes, he squandered money on the basest acts, often performing merely to
shock or horrify his wife.  Elspa took to avoiding him, somehow detecting
the brute\@s presence before he would enter the room.  Agjar grew more and
more jealous of Elspa and his father\@s ring.  One day, in Elspa\@s fifteenth
summer, he came into the manor to find Agjar beating his mother, screaming
obscenities about him taking \#What was his by right!\#  

Something snapped in Elspa, and he looked at Agjar, and saw everything wrong
with the world.  The gluttony, the wanton hedonism, the headlong rush to
self-destruction.  Everything pure within him boiled to a head, and he
raised his hand - in attack or defense he\@d never know, but a jagged bolt of
pure energy slammed into Agjar, knocking him back to the wall.  

Rushing to his mother, he saw that she had already been beaten to death, her
frail ribs broken under the drunken Agjar\@s onslaught.  

Shedding a tear, Elspa walked out of the manor, not looking back, with only
a single thought echoing through his mind.  

Now, there was another voice.  
~
E

{WChapter Two{x 

In the following year, Elspa grew even more withdrawn.  Always carrying his
father\@s signet ring, the boy was never a nuisance, but the finances of what
was now his mother\@s estate grew slim.  As the days past into summer, fewer
and fewer of the manor\@s trappings remained.  

His mother, desperate, remarried.  Agjar Dilis was a burly brute of a man,
rumoured by the servants to have kankoran blood.  Unperturbed by any
pretensions of the fineries of Earendam\@s older families, the man brought
new money and gutter taste to the manor.  

Using Lasilia and the family\@s name and titles, Agjar finally had his access
to society, and, in his mind, a sort of twisted respectability.  Still
scorned for his coarse ways, he began to fixate on Elspa\@s possession of the
family signet ring.  Lasilia would hear him muttering over his drink about
the boy, and how he came between him and respectability.  How the boy was at
fault for all his woes, how...  

As for Elspa, his father\@s suicide had touched the boy in a way that his
mother viewed as unnatural.  

She would often come upon him reading books in his father\@s library,
listening attentively, seemingly to nothing at all.  When questioned, he
would only look at her in blank astonishment, as if \#hearing them\# were the
most natural thing in the world.  
~
E
tome2~
Lisilia looked up at her son with a quizzical glance.  \#Who, Elspa?\#  

\#Father does.  He says he\@s sorry\#

And with that, the boy got a very odd look on his face, and begun crying.  

On the way back to the manor house, Elspa would not stop crying.  Reassuring
her son, Lisilia couldn\@t help but wonder - usually the boy had an empathy
for the things around him.  And, the estate\@s finances hadn\@t been well.  

The boy rushed out of his mother\@s arms, up the tall stairwell to his
father\@s study.  Lisilia, struck by the silence in the house, followed
closely behind, and it wasn\@t until she actually entered the room that she
saw what her son had somehow known.  

Her husband, dead, with his bloodstained dagger in his hand.  

And all she could think was...  

\#He says that he\@s sorry.\#  
~
E
tome1~
{WChapter One{x

Lisilia looked at her son on the beach, and was momentarily happy.  An
uncharacteristically sunny day on the Uthlin, she had brought her son here
on the insistence of her husband Caval.  

\#Go\#, he\@d said, and let her take the carriage, despite the business in
Earendam that he claimed kept him from going along.  

\#Elspa needs it.  The boy...  The boy\@s too reserved.  He spends too much
time in the library, or talking to his imaginary friends - and too little
doing the things a boy should.\#  

Her husband had paled, and gotten that worried look on his face that had
come ever since the raid last year on their estate that had gutted their
fields.  

Elspa looked up from the sand castle he was making, and looked his green
eyes right at his mother.  

\#He says that he\@s sorry.\#

Nefortu-
Untrustworthy in the extreme, it is wise to always be on your guard about these
tricksters and never trust their word. Many are harmless, but those who embrace
darkness are the most cunning and ruthless of foes.
  
Shuddeni-
They are our enemy. Our antithesis. What more can be said of our race\@s eternal foe?
They are born in darkness as we are in light. Our conflict is without quarter or
mercy.
  
Srryn-
These brutal reptiles ally themselves with the forces of darkness with a handful
of exceptions. Their brute strength and vicious natures make them potent foes. I have
long fought a srryn fire templar, blessed by his foul serpent god, and our battles
have been bloody and fierce. We both bear scars and will gain more before one
of us is well and finally dead.
~
E
volume3~
Chaja-
I pity these foul beings even as I strike them down. An eternity of slavery and
being denied their freedom has made them foul and base. I can only hope they take
comfort in the freedom I grant them at the end of my blade and take peace in the
knowledge their cruel masters will soon follow.
   
Ethron-
The friendly nature of the ethron people is so wonderful. They make fast allies
in the battle against darkness and steadfast friends in times of peace. Their woods
are among the most beautiful of places I have seen in all of Avendar.
  
Humans-
I find humans to be such a curiosity. By far the most prolific race on Avendar,
their nature and skills run the gamut of good and evil, law and chaos. This
versatility makes them impossible to break down into a mere stereotype, so I
won\@t give it much effort.
  
Kankoran-
Wild and free, I admire the unburdened spirit of these northern wolf-men. If they
know it or not they embody the heart of Rystaia\@s teachings on freedom. More is
the pity, therefore, with those who walk the path of evil and who trammel their own
spirits with the burden of guilt. They pervert the gift their race has inherited and 
bring my wrath upon them.
~
E
volume2~
Volume 2- The Ch\@taren, as writ by Meliaos, Crusader of Rystaia
  
Aelin-
The aelin race tears at me. Some of the greatest heroes for good I have
had the honor of meeting are of the race, and yet the darkest magi I\@ve had
to fight share their lineage. I have learned to trust their actions and
scrutinize their words, for their tongues are as silver as my eyes.
  
Alatharya-
The alatharya and I clash on occassion, but it is their simplicity and their
brute ways that cause our fights, no true malice on their part. It pains me
to come to blows with them for our race was struck a blow by the gods as well.
Let the foul Dragon know Vailios is not forgotten.
  
Caladaran-
The caladaran are so very wise and peaceful I could keep company with one for
hours. I must admit their perspective is so much different than mine. Perhaps
their longevity gives them patience I cannot be bothered to harbor in my
travels.  Such self-discipline is to be admired, I suppose.

Hot wind lashed over the castle battlement and clarion cries

the cobbled stone below. \#Stop him! Seize him!\# came the cry
from below but Sealdar heard none of it as he matched wits and
steel with his ferocious furred foeman. \#I thought you dead!\#
growled Rakjar, his scimitar drawing a crimson line over the
Aelin\@s rippling chest. Sealdar hissed through the pain,
\#I could say the same of you!\# he replied, his retort mirrored
with a rapier-strike in turn to stain the Kankoran\@s red fur a
deeper scarlet. Rakjar roared in fury, \#This time there will
be no doubt!\# and lunged to tear out the handsome\@s Aelin\@s
throat...

AND so they left the Caverns through secret, newly-tunneled routes and in
a single night came on demon-back and demon-wing to Ad\@masteisa, where the
unprepared folk could mount little resistance before they fell.  However,
the shuddeni soon learned that their spies had greatly exaggerated the depth
and extend of tunnels into Rimora.  As the old allies of light banded
together again and made their way through the broken lands to Ad\@masteisa,
the shuddeni forces scattered, abandoning the ruins of the haven and fleeing
back to the darkness of their deepest ancestral caverns.  

THE remaining havens are little like the cities of other mortals.   After
the destruction of Ad\@masteisa, each raised towers (called sy\@ceera) to
detect void magics and provide the first defense against them.  Also,
the citizenry is highly transient--the dwellings empty and fill as the
ch\@taren come and go, following their carefree and wandering lifestyle.
Few ch\@taren reside in the city permanently, though the elderly are more
apt to settle than ch\@taren youth, and provide the stability and leadership
needed in any society. A few goodly folk of other races have been allowed
to settle in the havens, and their numbers have slowly grown over the years
significantly adding to the stability of the haven societies.

MOST ch\@taren trained in the templar arts will, at some point during their
residence in a haven, volunteer to serve as a Warder.  The Warders make up
an informal watch, providing a measure of security to ch\@taren and
non-ch\@taren inhabitants against mischief. A select group of Warders (again,
often the more elderly) in each haven make up the elect group known as
Spiritlords.  The Spiritlords see to the defense of the haven, man the
sy\@ceera, and safeguard the oldest surviving ch\@taren relics and lore.
~
E
tome3~
THE first was the haven of the waves.  On the remote island of Alensha, a
city with walls of white marble streaked with ch\@lonin was created.  It came
to be known as Jh\@ten.  Water scholars fashioned an amazing aqueduct system
in the city which still has no equal.  The second was the haven of the ice. 
In the far north, the settlement of Avayn was established, carved from the
base of a mighty glacier and protected from the chill of ice by water
scholars.  It remains the most purely ch\@taren of all places in Avendar, and
is the repository of most relics and artifacts from the ch\@taren homeworld. 
The third was the haven of the wind.  In the Broken Lands to the far east of
Earendam, Ad\@masteisa, a city of ch\@lonin- streaked terraces and graceful
ledge dwellings, was fashioned from the stone of a mountain face.  

THERE were rumors of a fourth haven as well, a hidden haven where the
greatest artifacts of the ch\@taren plane were secreted (though this is
generally denied by the Spiritlords, and has remained undiscovered, if it
actually exists).  

ONLY a decade had passed after the construction of the havens when the
shuddeni raised a final insurgence, seeking to break from the Thrandir
Caverns where they had been cornered.  The shuddeni warmasters had,
through nefortu spies, learned of the Havens and determined to claim
Ad\@masteisa, the cliff-city, as the rumors of tunnels into mount Rimora
made it a promising shuddeni stronghold.
~
E
tome2~
AFTER the final of the great campaigns of the War of Night, when the
shuddeni had at last been driven back into the deepest recesses of the
under-earth, the ch\@taren and their allies came to realize a basic fact:
the ch\@taren were homeless in Avendar.  During the conflict, they had
stayed with and battled side by side with their human, aelin, ethron,
and  caladaran allies, but when the conflict ended this arrangement
seemed likewise to need an end--for even the greatest guests are likely
to eventually outwear their welcomes.

THIS was not an immediate concern for the ch\@taren themselves, as they
felt little inclination to settle.  Why this is so is a subject of debate,
for they remembered well the great cities built with the Art of Availlae
in their home plane.  But in Avendar, the homing instinct, the need to claim
territory and raise permanent shelters, was weaker within them, as was the
Art of Availlae itself.  In the weeks immediately after the Battle of the
Thrandir Caves, with the shuddeni threat seeming ended, the ch\@taren
gradually dispersed.  Travelling alone or in friend or kin groups, the
ch\@taren adopted a wandering lifestyle and spread throughout the land.

AFTER a few short years of wandering, however, the elders and sages among
the ch\@taren began to see a need for places of gathering, places where
ch\@taren could go for refuge and safety when necessary, places where
ch\@taren could meet with ch\@taren to bear and raise a new generation.
Also needed were places where the remaining lore, relics, and artifacts
from their homeworld could be stored and safeguarded.  And so, with
consultation from their allies of the war, particularly the great archmagi
of water with whom they had been allied so closely during the war, three
places were chosen, which came to be known as the Three Havens.  Using
what little of the Art of Availlae that they could draw upon in this plane,
and being supported by the native water and earth magi in their workings,
the ch\@taren made their havens.

ale mug well-balanced brew balanced~
This beer is remarkably unremarkable; neither too dark nor too light; it
has some foam but not the aggressively brimming head of some; from the odor,
it seems hoppy yet not nearly as sharp as an average pale ale; it smells
flavorful yet not rich; dark, but not heavy; the bubbles fizz agreeably,
neither possessing the effervesence of champagne nor the sluggish fuzz of a
porter; mild herbal notes waft from the mug, though nothing so fragrant as a
lambic nor earthy as a stout.  

This does, indeed, seem a well-balanced brew.

cup white chaos fermented distilled dushasn~
This small handleless ceramic cup contains a quantity of milky white
dushasn liquor, called \@white chaos\@ by ch\@taren.  It seems slightly viscid
and is relatively odorless.

Darenhalf,
I was able to get into the grove surrounding Shelratha, but
I have no woodcraft and didn\@t make it to the structure itself
before being spotted by a mage. The mage was foolish enough
to listen to my story of being lost, long enough to drop her
guard. I give you this dagger I took from her--ch\@lonin streaked,
very valuable in the right markets--as proof and pledge of my
continued efforts. 

I\@ll make another attempt soon, and should meet with more
success now that I know what to expect around the structure.
Til then, I\@ll just bide my time with my sister at the White
Bow. Best that you continue to stay out of town, though. I
don\@t think the Warders would tolerate you and your friends,
even in what goes for the \#rougher\# parts of town in this
place.

This tiny half-skiff is made of some light, strong wood, though the type
is impossible to identify through the thick white enamel which coats it.  A
high, backward-curving prow has been cunningly carved into the figurehead of
an orange-billed swan.  Sturdy white features are fletched into the wood,
picking out the details of the neck, wing-tips, and tail.

A spiritlord\@s ch\@lonin-streaked sword is here.~
In the War of Night, the ch\@taren hosts drawn from their native realm of
spirit brought along with them their weapons, armor, and other equipment. 
Most of this equipment was formed of ch\@lonin, the rare spirit substance. 
After the war, to extend the application of this materials, ch\@taren
crafters rendered down their items and applied the ch\@lonin to equipment and
structures fashioned of materials from the Prime Plane.  The ch\@lonin melded
easily with most of these materials, forming steel-hardened translucent
streaks of a golden hue throughout stone, steel, and other materials.

A Rooftop Garden~
This broad roof stretches away before you, bordered in a low wall of
carved white stone.  Slender pillars of the same milky marble stretch upward
in a random profusion of varying heights, each tipped with a glimmering
spiritlight.  Turf has been painstakingly lifted to the roof, and grass
flourishes underfoot.  Small evergreen trees dot the border of the garden. 
A sheltered portal on the eastern side of the roof leads down a golden,
spiral staircase.  All around you, the minarets and domes of Jh\@ten,
surrounded by the ch\@lonin-streaked walls, glitter and sparkle in an
impressive vista.

A Stained Winery~
The smooth white floors and walls of this ch\@taren building are spattered
in a perpetual coating of deep purplish-red grapes.  Large presses dominate
the center of the room, tubs stacked haphazardly around the edges along with
casks and boxes of empty glass bottles.  The pungent scent of sweet
fermenting fruit fills the air.

A Spacious Warehouse~
This large, open space serves as the main cloth warehouse in Jh\@ten.  The
walls of pale marble soar upwards for a significant distance, unsupported by
pillar or buttress.  Curved and almost organic in their design, the walls of
the warehouse have been painted in delicate shades of rose and yellow.  The
effect is not unlike standing within an enormous, amorphous seashell.  Small
spiritlights cast faint shadows among the arrays of concentrically circular
shelves in the warehouse.  Hundreds of bolts of fabric - cotton and duskin
wool - are stacked in a mass of color, waiting for export.  The warehouse
stretches gracefully away to the west.  An ornate stair spirals its way to
the rooftop.

The Columns of the Temple~
The southern end of Rystaia\@s temple stands here, not far distant from
the thick city walls that encompass the southern reaches of the city.  From
this high vantage point you can see over the wall to the goldenrain forest,
the slopes and high plateau of western Alensha, and the deep blue Uthlin
beyond.  Along the temple promenade that runs northward, rows of marble
columns stand, each column topped with a perfect crystal sphere.  To the
north, in the center of the promenade, stand a raised dais.  Upon it sits
the white altar of Rystaia.

temple pyramid.  Each column is straight and smooth, very slightly thicker
at the base than at the top.  Russet and blue veins streak through the
gleaming white marble in abstract, almost-random patterns.  At the top of
each column rests a perfect crystal sphere, clear by day but glowing with
soft amber light by night.

The Temple Fountain~
In this section of the open-air temple, a fountain bursts forth from a
pool of white marble.  The water seems to shimmer and glint with unusual
light within the fountain, and it sparkles brilliantly as it dances up into
a fanning spray and cascades down again.  To the east and west, slender
columns stretch upward and are tipped with large crystal spheres. 
Southwards, a white altar stands on a raised dais.

Naeros Lane is narrower than other streets throughout Jh\@ten.  This

fastened to the lower boughs keep darkness from the roadway.  The lane ends

worn from the passage to and from the sea-side wharfs.  Directly southeast,

This small building houses the office of the Jh\@ten warders.  The walls

surroundings.  Pinned to the back of the simple wooden door in the western

Xnenaia Road~
Xnenaia Road wends its way through Jh\@ten, the Haven of the Waves.  Paved
in smooth, bluish cobbles of granite, the street curves slightly to the east
and west in a periodic pattern.  Looking down the length of the street, the
buildings match the sway of the road, the effect somewhat reminiscent of
rolling ocean swells.  The warehouse district buildings are rather large,
sculpted from pale, flowing marble, small trees and gardens seen growing on
their tall roofs.  The street undulates to the north and south, opening into
the busy Trader Square to the north and continuing south.  To the east and
west, low buildings dedicated to the Warders of Jh\@ten stand, contrasting
with the larger warehouses beyond them.

The Temple of Rystaia~
The temple of Rystaia is an airy, high edifice atop a tiered pyramid in
the southwestern corner of Jh\@ten.  To the north, the great stairway which
lines the entire face of the structure leads down to one of the main city
thoroughfares.  The temple extends to the south, where slender marbles
columns topped with crystal spheres surround the central altar and a vibrant
fountain sprays mist high into the air.  The vista of Jh\@ten is open before
you, with its raised white stone buildings and spires emerging from a sea of
light green foliage.  Not far to the north, the elegant ch\@lonin-streaked
towers of Ys\@raiva and Avayn reach skyward to at least double the height of
the temple, and on the far end of the city, the great tower of Shelratha

The Temple of Rystaia~
High above the street level of Jh\@ten rises the open-air temple of
Rystaia.  A high-spouting fountain and gleaming columns stretch away to the
south, forming the open-air temple, but the structure itself is perched on
the flattened top of a massive pyramidal base.  The entire northern face of
the structure is a very steep but broad stairway.  Many of the stones on the
stairway and in this portion of the temple floor have been carved with small
symbols, names, and other identifying marks of those who have called the
Jh\@ten haven their home for a time.  The carvings serve to enhance rather
than detract from the beauty of the structure.

placed around the square provide a small amount of shade, and their green

The Clothier\@s Workroom~
This long, wide room is accessed by a small stairwell in the southwest
corner.  The polished hardwood floor is partially covered in thick,
vibrantly-colored rugs, and the walls are of pale white stone.  Various
personal items of the clothier, including boxes and bins of cloth, spools of
thread, and bottles filled with bone and metal needles take of most of the
space in the room.  The sights and sounds of the traffic passing down Aolar
Avenue, from the Temple of Rystaia to the Trader\@s market, comes from a
wide, open window in the northern wall.  The window also has a view of the
western side of Trader\@s Square.

elsewhere throughout the city.  At the center of the busy market square, the
booths and stalls give way to a white marble fountain ringed with slender
columns, each topped in turn by a glass sphere filled with spirit-light.  A
jet of water intermittently shoots up from the fountain, and a water

Intersection of Aolar Avenue and Alair Street~
The central street of Jh\@ten, Aolar Avenue is cobbled in dull white-grey
stones.  It is met here by Alair street, which extends off to the north. 
The street broadens into a near-plaza as it runs to the bottom of a high
step-pyramid structure to the south.  The entire front face of the structure
is a broad staircase.  Standing well back from the temple and street, and
surrounded by thick green turves, are ch\@taren dwellings and shops, some

The main trader market in Jh\@ten takes place in this vast, open plaza at
the intersection of Aolar Avenue and Xnenaia Road.  A few goldenrain trees
placed around the square provide a small amount of shade, and their green
leaves and golden flowers add a splash of color to the otherwise dull greys
and whites of the tall structures surrounding the market and lining the
roads.  The many booths, stands and carts placed randomly throughout the
square make passage rather congested, even at night.  To the north, Xnenaia

sculpture sculptures seraph seraphim~
The seraph sculptures include all nine of the Seraphim of the
Convocation, each wrought and painted in vivid detail:

A masculine, war-like seraph has been brushed with powdered lapis lazuli. 
Cords of muscle and sinew are picked out dramatically.  Two wings sprout
from his shoulders, and his hands are empty.  

A squat, two-winged seraph seems disproportionately stocky.  He bears a
massive bow, and a curved war horn hangs from his brocaded belt.  His skin,
definitely a peculiar feature, is translucent and encrusted with luminescent
jagged glass.  His head, in no way spherical, lacks hair, sprouting instead
a multitude of minute crystal formations.  

An androgynous two-winged seraph holds a glittering orb in its upraised
hand.  A delicate metallic stole drapes its neck.  The lips are set in a
gentle, compassionate smile.  

A willowy two-winged seraph with abundant, coiffed, curly hair bears a
slender staff in one hand, standard-like, and a chalice in the other.  The
posture is casual, almost impudent, and there seems a distinct energy to
this figure.  

Thickly muscled, with extremely broad shoulders and a deep copper skin tone,
this male seraph is massive.  The crown of his head crests fourteen feet,
and his bare arms and legs are heavily muscled with corded sinew.  In his
hands are gripped a war-banner.  

Tall, slender and effeminately muscled; this male seraph hovers here on four
wings.  The pair emerging from his ribs have a ten foot wingspan, and the
pair spread from his waist have a two foot wingspan.  He wears a thin, neat
moustache, and bears a long silver clarion.  

Devoid of hair and eyebrows, this bronze-hued seraph is enshrouded with a
golden carapace of liquid ch\@lonin.  A slender fluted neck; pert nose, small
ears and full lips accentuate her femininity.  Statuesque and sleekly
muscled, her arms and legs lend length to her frame.  She wields a sharp,
circular blade with casual grace and familiarity.  

Young, beautiful and pregnant, this golden-hued bears a swollen stomach. 
Tall and slender (save for her bulging belly), her bare, well-toned but
sleek arms do not reflect her expectant condition.  Her curly hair shimmers
gold and falls to her shoulders, and her sharply defined jaws frame an
upturned nose, rounded chin and thinly chiseled lips.  Her hands are empty,
clasped demurely under the bulge.  

The last seraph is the most overtly warlike of the nine: tall,
golden-shimmered and sleekly muscled, it hovers on six wings.  Flaxen hair
tumbles out from a massive war-helm.  Statuesque but slender, her exposed
arms and legs are well toned.  Her wings, translucent and veined with a
copper-sheened luminescence, are divided into three different pairs: the
pair emerging from her shoulder blades have a two-foot wingspan, the pair
unfurled from her ribs have a twelve-foot wingspan, and the pair spread from
her waist have a five-foot wingspan.  She wears heavy greaves and bears an
enormous shield and glittering javelin.

fishes, naiads, mermen, and other sea creatures, done in white and
aquamarine shells.  A flight of narrow stone stairs leads up to the main
floor of the house.  At the far end of the room, opposite the stairway, an
unusual fountain is set in the floor.  Several slender pillars of sparkling
water rise upward, to stop at waist height and then fan out over the center
of the fountains basin, creating a hazy mist above it.

A Large House~
This large house is tastefully decorated in an oceanic theme.  Blue
drapes end in white frilled lace to appear like water falls and the carpet
is a deep blue as well.  The house\@s furniture is carved with fantastical
sea creatures; kraken and horn-whales, sea-serpents and great sharks.  A

The Alair marketplace square is nestled in between the magic and

multiple cobbled paths that wend their way through small stands of
goldenrain trees and beds of leafy shrubs and flowers, to the guild
buildings, and around a statue-ringed fountain in the center of the square. 
Here along the eastern edge of the square, a unique structure stands--the
Jh\@ten air guild.  The guild and its contents are invisible.  The outline of
the building is discernable only through colorful pennants and banners that
hang from its unseen walls.

The Center of Alair Market~
At the center of this wide open-air market is a large magical fountain. 
The fountain blasts intermittent sprays of water high up into the air, which
then shimmer with light and twist into unusual shapes before plummeting back
down into the fountain basin.  Ringing the fountain are a series of
life-like statues showing ch\@taren scholars working with water, air, and
earth scholars of other races.  High above the market square, to the west,
the towers of Avayn and Ys\@Raiva stand, housing the Jh\@ten water and spirit
guilds.  Along the east edge of the square stand smaller guildhouses of air
and earth, as well as the alchemy guild.

The statues are life-sized and so detailed as to be lifelike.  A scene on
one side of the fountain shows a ch\@taren scholar posed with hand over her
heart, as if demonstrating or gesturing for effect to a robed aelin who
looks on thoughtfully.  One another, a caladaran and ethron demonstrate
something which involves a staff and a sapling to two onlooking ch\@taren. 
Yet another scene shows a human and ch\@taren looking together at a scroll
and laughing as if sharing some sort of joke.

A small cauldron and a handful of other alchemical instruments sit some

The Alair Market~
Alair Square is wide open-air market located in central Jh\@ten, between
the guildhouses and towers of magic.  In this portion of the square, Alair
Street, which bisects the square, leads northward toward Chaoys Avenue.  The
cobblestones of the road split into various smaller paths that wind
throughout stands of trees and thick low-cut grass, where the shops and
stalls of merchants vie for the best shaded positions near the main road.

The Alair Market~
The wide base of the tower of Ys\@raiva stands at the western edge of the
marketplace.  The white marble of the tower is streaked with amber-gold
ch\@lonin, fortifying the stone and imbuing it with the powers of spirit. 
The tower rises high over the surrounding buildings, matched only by the
slightly shorter tower of Avayn to the south, and surpassed only by
Shelratha, in the northern section of the city.  A few goldenrain trees
provide shade, and a path of polished white agate leads up to the doors of
the tower.

A Wide Entry Hall~
The entry hall of the Tower of Ys\@raiva is a spacious and opulently
decorated room.  The white stone walls are adorned with colorful tile
mosaics which depict great workings of spirit magic.  Ornate rugs and
carpets from Ashta Harrud cover the floor.  At the far end of the room, a
large staircase with a gilded banister rises up in a graceful curve, leading
to the training areas for the spirit-casters in Jh\@ten.

The tower of Ys\@raiva\@s highest chamber is a circular, spacious room
completely empty of furnishings.  The austere white marble walls and
polished tile floors gleam and sparkle with the reflections of thousands
upon thousands of motes of spirit-light that sweep around the edges and
ceiling of the room, moving in all directions, some slower and others
faster.  As the reflections of the spirit-lights cross over the streaks of
ch\@lonin in the marble walls, small flares of white light erupt.

elaborately carved legs, topped with a glowing silver-laced cloth, rests
along the western wall.  On the far side of the room, a stairwell grants

Naeros Lane~
In the center of Naeros Lane, the road broadens and splits into a circle
as it wends its way around a tall stone statue.  The statue depicts a ki-rin
raring back on its hind legs, and at double life-size it stands almost as
tall as the young white oaks which rise up along the road.  Among the oaks,
a tangle of wild, bushy shrubs and thick clumps of grasses with billowy
tufts form a verdant border for the lane.

Naeros Lane is narrower than other streets throughout Jh\@ten.  This

and clumps of long-stemmed ornamental grasses.  Large white maples stretch
out over the lane, forming a shaded bower.  However, the small spirit-lights
fastened to the lower boughs keep darkness from the roadway.  Small paths
break off to either side of the lane, leading to various buildings which are
surrounded by flowering trees and gardens.  One particularly large path to
the west leads to a large structure which extends all the way back to the

Yelia Square~
Four large statues dominate this four-way intersection of streets in
northern Jh\@ten.  At each corner of the intersection, a white marble unicorn
rears up, looming over the street below to touch the horn tips of the other
statues high above the center of the square.  The base of each statue is
overgrown with yellow-flowering vines.  Chaoys Avenue continues its
east-west course through the city, and Xnenaia Road extends southward as a
main thoroughfare, while narrowing to a small lane northward.

statue statues unicorn marble horn base~
The unicorn statues form a majestic arch over the intersection below. Each
statue is much larger than life-size, but wrought in amazingly realistic
detail. The white marble of the stone is polished, the few slight
grey streaks and clouds of the stone concentrated around the lower limbs
and hooves. The horns of the statues meet together above the exact center 
of the intersection.

A haiku and the name of the sculptor are engraven in the base of one of
the statues, visible among the flowered vines.

   Essence of a leap--
   What purity, joy, and hope
   The wild heart descries.

Before the Grove of Shelratha~
The small cobbled lane passes behind several graceful ch\@taren structures
to come to a dead end here.  Northward, between the lane and the tall city
walls, a silver-and-ironwrought fence encircles an open grove of tall leafy
trees.  The trees hide the base of the tower of Shelratha, which looms high
up over this end of Jh\@ten, its white stone streaked in fine veins of
golden-hued ch\@lonin.

The Kitchen of the Ch\@lonin Chalice~
The kitchen of the Ch\@lonin Chalice is a long room with several fire pits
along the north end, over which pots bubble and spits with roasted meats
drip grease into the flames.  Stacks of dishes and cups stand on wide
shelves, along with pots, pans, spoons, and other kitchen implements.  The
floor is clean-swept, and spirit-lights set in sconces along the walls keep
the room brightly illuminated.

The Arena of Illusion~
This elevated platform runs along the stone walls of a broad, high-
vaulted chamber.  Faint slivers of light stream through thin window-slits
along the platform, but the room is illuminated primarily by the arena
below.  Formed of illusory magic, the arena board appears as a glowing,
miniaturized map bounded by shimmering border-lines, numbers and letters. 
From this vantage point, there is a clear view of the happenings across the
entire arena board.

A Rooftop Patio~
The entire flat roof of the dwelling serves as an open-air patio,
providing an excellent view of this side of the city.  In the distance, the
crest of the city walls is visible.  Looking out across the city, ch\@lonin-
streaked white towers rise from green foilage and grey-white streets to form
a picturesque skyline.  The patio contains several benches, potted leafy
trees and lush plants, and is surrounded by a graceful balustrade.  At each
corner of the balustrade a small seraph statue stands in a slight
depression, a stone channel set in its base to funnel away rainwater.

The Library Lectern~
This space along the balcony floor of the Jh\@ten library is designed to
make a place for scholars to review and discuss texts together, or to give
lectures.  The shelves give way to an open space with a handful of chairs
and a simple goldenwood lectern.  Two large paintings adorn the wall behind
the lectern, one a watercolor of the School of Spirit above Enrien, and
another an artist\@s rendition of pre-war days, showing Rystaia and Vaialos
in a ch\@taren city in the spirit realms.

The Ch\@lonin Vault~
This bank building is a solid, square-walled structure built to standard
aelin and human sensibilities.  The walls are unusually thick, and the white
marbled tile of the reception room is faintly clouded with gray.  The floor
is entirely carpeted with flushed red velvet, streaked with golden threads
to resemble the ch\@lonin found in structures elsewhere throughout the city.

A golden plaque is set on the wooden counter at the far end of the room.

The entryway of the Rare Blessing Inn is a small anteroom with
wood-paneled walls and dark rugs upon the floor.  A small replica of the
Anaiama Crystals, intricately carven and polished in warm grey stone, stands
near the arched doorway.  From beyond doors, the muffled sounds of the
streets of Jh\@ten and the Trader Marketplace can be heard.  Past the

Top of a Narrow Staircase~
This narrow staircase is quite cramped, each step barely three feet wide

carpeted with braided Jh\@teni rugs.  Peaked doors, painted a cheery green,
open to the north and east.  The stair continues above and below, leading
down to the second level of the inn, and upward through a hatch out onto the
top of the tower.

The Bar at the Staff and Amulet~
This common room of the Staff and Amulet is a large, round room.  Beams
of imported oak are interspaced with white plaster, and roughly-knit
hangings of thick wool line the walls.  The smell of woodsmoke and roasting
meat hangs in the air, and the polished floorboards are covered with a thin
layer of dry rushes.  A large, circular fireplace fashioned from red clay
roars in the center of the room.  A curved bar of milky white stone rises
from the floor, artfully lit from within by tiny motes of spiritlight.

A Turn in an Aqueduct Channel~
The channel makes a gentle, steady curve here, changing direction to
follow the layout of the main streets in the city above.  Midway into the
curve, a smaller channel breaks off toward the south, and currents swirl and
eddy as they come together.

An Aqueduct Channel~
Dark and completely filled with fast-flowing, fresh water, the great
aqueduct of Jh\@ten runs below the streets, channeling water to and from
major areas of the city.  Though the aqueduct is several feet below ground,
occasional muffled noises can be heard from the streets above.  A single
main current pulls strongly at you, though several smaller currents can be

A Narrow Tunnel~
This narrow tunnel makes its way through the earth, zigzagging for

from shipping crates, and the walls carved out of tight-packed earth and
dense rocks.  The occasional tarred vertical beam shores up the tunnel roof
in places.  The air is cool and damp, and cobwebs stretch from corner to

A Curved Cavern~
This cave seems to have been naturally formed in a pocket of grey
limestone.  The walls are curved and smooth, and water drips from overhead,
flowing out to the south down a runnel in the sloped passage floor.  Slender
stalactites and stalagmites rim the room, their moist surfaces looking
vaguely slimy in the light.  To the east, a clearly manmade tunnel has been
excavated out of the rock; a pile of grey shale chips stands beside the
portal.  Southwards, a natural tunnel descends into darkness.

A Narrow Tunnel~
This natural tunnel curves its way through dirty grey limestone, rising
and falling unevenly with the flow of the rock.  The cavelike walls crowd in
at points, forcing travelers to duck, and bend outwards in others.  Water
rushes underfoot, a small trickling runnel wearing its way into the cave
floor as it flows southward.  Moisture beads the walls and drips from the
roof, feeding the tiny flow.  The underground passage opens into a cave to
the north, vanishing around a sharp bend to the south.

This small cave is formed naturally out of the dirty limestone walls. 
Large, thick pillars formed from the dripping water stretch from floor to
ceiling.  The walls are beaded with drops of the glistening moisture, and
the air is chilly and dank.  A small, gurgling stream of water flows in from
the natural tunnel to the north, splashing into a deep pool which fills the
center of the room.  The pool seems to extend down for quite some distance;
no bottom is visible.
