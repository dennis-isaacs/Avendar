the soldier~
A soldier stands guard over the Krilin pass, eyes alert and intent.
~

A young, hale man attired as a junior officer from Krilin, Garik moves

The giant mica crab lies with its legs tucked under its belly, staring out to sea.
~
Easily as wide as an alatharya is tall, the giant mica crab takes a stern
disinterest in all it surveys, including its young scattered about the
beach.  The crab itself fades in well with the cliff, its black shell
studded with glittering mica, making a curious scintillating affect,
reflecting the weak light in thin shards.  Every so often, it waves an claw
as long as a human, as if to exercise stiff shoulders.

a bull bjorcha~
A bull bjorcha stamps its feet, looking for a fight.
~
Thick-set and thick-furred, the bull bjorcha is built for surviving in
the cold, its four legs splayed slighty for extra balance in the high winds.
Antlers grow up and out from its skull, each antler having up to seven
points, all in a curved line.  Most of its bulk appears to sit around its
chest, and a charge from this animal could be fearsome indeed.

of the kankoran, he has taken on the role of spiritual protector of the
kankoran and advisor to Braka, although his advice on practical matters may
be a little uncertain.  Old age is starting to show its marks, however, as
his brown fur looks patchy and bare, and his once powerful body is beginning
to waste away.

Unbelievably large for a kankoran, Jarkar is the epitome of strength,
muscles bulking under his thick brown fur, making his leathern armor creak
with the strain.  His eyes seem bright and alert, yet there is something
about the slackness of his face that suggests that he hasn\@t the wits to
match his brawn.  Taken in and protected from ridicule by Rilgaryr, he has
adopted the ancient kankoran as his charge, and is less than trusting of
those he doesn\@t know in the ancient\@s prescence.

tunic.  Even his hair changes with the shimmer.  Only Arbanath-Lozar\@s face
shows any stability, with penetrating ice-blue eyes and a hawkish nose.

stable, which is certainly easier on your vision.

Braka~
Braka is here, contemplating the future of the pack.
~
A magnificent kankoran, Braka presents with the best attributes of his
race.  Tall and athletic, he has proven himself time and again in the hunt,
and his prowess has protected the pack from several incursions.  Although
his movements seem easy and expansive, his ice-blue eyes observe all
quietly, keeping a note on his environment.  Clad in bear furs of the purest
white, he also wears a thin harness, from which dangle small fetishes carved
from single pieces of rock.

Slightly larger than a red fox, the silver bears more muscle and a
shaggier coat, with minimal sacrifice to agility.  Sharp, pointed features
are the hallmark of the silver fox, although its name is a little off-mark,
its coat being light grey.

The shade of a battle-worn kankoran hovers here.

Before you is the translucent figure of a kankoran shade.  Insubstantial
dark red fur covers his muscled body, except for his chest which bears a
much lighter shade.  Where numerous scars mark its arms and back, the fur is
matted black with dried blood.  The shade\@s eyes are an almost hypnotic
yellow, set beneath thick, bushy brows.  The semblance of a simple leather
necklace appears to hang about its neck.

the hunchling~
A hunchling is hard at work, maintaining the engine.
~
Desc About three feet high when hunched over in their natural state
(maintaining), and looking something like a chimpazee, the hairy hunchlings
spend their life attending to the machinery that keeps the northern plains
refrigerated.  Were it not for their faithful, slightly overzealous efforts,
the plains would soon overheat, and desertify.  Blue overalls are the
regular outfit of these maintenance \@lings.

These leggings are fashioned by kankoran for kankoran, following the open

not to the Ryarl pack, who are far more concerned with preserving
traditional garb.  The bone fetishes which line the legs are typical of that
region, and the markings along the hide suggest a tribute to Girikha the
Windwolf.

A sturdy braided rope several inches thick hangs down from the dome,
holding a round wicker basket several feet in diameter.  The sides curve up
a few more feet, and one may climb into the basket through a depression in
the side.  A round, soft mattress stuffed with furs is covered by an old
patchwork quilt.  The nest-like bed smells faintly of lavendar and anise,
and the the interior of the lacquered wicker cushioned with a thin bolster
for extra comfort.

sheet1~
This sheet of parchment is quite thin, stretched and beaten to
near-transparency, the substance flimsy.  It has apparently been used for
taking a rubbing, the marks of a broad, sweeping hand outlining carved words
from a rough surface.  The soft lead has revealed the following words: 

i am the thunderhead which darkens on the horizon
  
gloom is my herald with despair my blind huntsman
  
i am the tomb of hope and the sepulcher of holies
  
the yellow tower shall crumble crowned with flame
  
in my wastes of ancient clockworks none shall but
  
live only to praise my terrible name endlessly on
  
i am the bare bones of the earth defiled and nude
  
ripped asunder to reveal stony horrors deep below
  
i am the ash which chokes when all fires lie dead
  
then bright light of the northeast shall wink out
  
for a false illusion it will spend itself utterly
  
bloody the talon which wrings life from the young
  
wholly mine is given the deathless sleeps of ages
  
mine is the power that does not fade into nothing
  
i am the chill wave spawned by a dead stale ocean
  
which does tear and strain upon sterile shoreline
  
the ki\@yadi shall take up my name born to descend
  
on wings of night will his voice command the mass
  
i own the husk of a broken world laid open to die
  
beneath my feet the land cries out helpless alone


A small note is slashed on the back in grease pencil.

The note is largely illegible, written in a long, careless hand with a

a series of bone earrings~
A set of bone earrings, intended to be worn on one kankoran ear, is here.~
These earrings were first crafted as part of a ceremonial rite of passage
for powerful kankoran warriors.  In more recent times, they have become more
representative of the kankoran style of ornamentation, which in its own way,
still exults the ancient rituals of the Ryarl pack.

A woven necklace of sinew and bone is here, waiting to be worn.~
This necklace is one of the few items sold in the Ryarl which encompasses
the whole of traditional kankoran religion.  It features the red cord, which
signifies blood; the black cord, that signifies the inevitability of death;
and the grey cord, which is an individual\@s path through the Ryarl.  The
bone fetishes are representative of the pack itself, and one\@s closeness to
it.

Low Cliffs~
The lower slope of a hill drops away rapidly to the north-east, a
vertical descent into the dark northern waters.  Blistering cold winds howl
over the cliff edge, bringing airborne ice, stinging exposed flesh.  A white
mantle covers the slope, from the peak of the hill to the south-west almost
all the way to the cliff edge.  Beyond the cliffs, large chunks of ice move
in the forbidding sea, forming islands and plateaus of their own.

The hill slopes down to the wide river mouth, which feeds the north sea. 
Cold, biting winds blow from the north, though somewhat interrupted by a

Rocky Spit~
Jutting out into the dark northern sea, the slightly crooked rocky spit
seems to point accusingly at the ice floes.  The footing here is a little
unsure, the snow being blown clear by desiccating winds wailing from the
floes, exposing rocks all too willing to move of their own accord.  All
around spreads the northern sea, visible between islands of ice, which
themselves contrast strongly, their vibrant blue and white bands at odds
with the black waters.  Far to the north, above the horizon, strange colours
dance in the sky.  Small waves lap at the foot of the spit, barely audible
over the strong winds.  A small rocky trail leads back to the plains.

Hill Overlooking the Hyloth~
Standing on the snow-laden peak of a hill, the powerful Hyloth can be
seen skirting by the lower slopes to the west, its frigid waters feeding the
ice sea.  The south-eastern slopes flatten out, becoming a broad, white
plain stretching to the horizon.  A wide red rock, not matching any in the
vicinity, has been hauled to the peak of the hill, and has had its top
flattened out and polished, allowing remarkable green veins to show through.
The wind is bitingly cold here, exposed on the hill-top, with nothing to
interrupt its flow.

The hill slopes gently here, prodding into the Hyloth river, forcing it
to redirect its course.  The jut of land here is thin enough to see both the
Hyloth rapids to the south, and the delta to the north.  Icy snow covers
every available surface, right down to the waterline, and little is

A long spit of granite juts out into the Hyloth, its snowy upper surface

small silt beach has accumulated on the downriver sit of the jut, allowing
easy access to the river.  To the east, a long slope up leads to the peak of
a small hill, covered in an endless blanket of white.

The Hyloth broadens here, turning into a dark wedge of almost freezing
water flowing north into the black seas under the ice.  Silt has built up in
strange patterns, some shallow enough to stand upon, with the water only
shin-deep, long thin bars pointing, fanned, out to the floes.  Silvery fish,
smaller than a finger, flit about in the shallows, unable to fight the
strong currents near the centre of the delta.  The watercourse turns sharply

The Hyloth River~
The Hyloth flows slowly, yet strongly here, approaching the end of its
course.  A tall, broad granite mound, layered with snow, lies to the north,
blocking the flow of the river, which turns to avoid the obstacle in its
path.  The bright snow seems at odds with the dull silt collecting at its
base.  A small break in the rocks to the west looks to lead to a rough
beach, at the base of the ridge so predominant on the Hyloth\@s west side.

A Slow-flowing Ford~
The Hyloth river slows down here, taking advantage of a natural basin in
its course, spreading out before narrowing drastically to the north.  At one
point, the neck of the basin seems shallow enough to cross on foot, the
frigid waters rippling slightly with the wind.  Patchy snow lines the banks
here, and small spiky reeds try to survive in the slower waters near the
bank.  The ford connects the wide eastern plains to a thin embankment to the
west, over which a tall ridge looms, aged and crumbling.

A Split in the River~
Flowing ever northward, the Hyloth takes pause here to pass around a
small island, slightly off-centre from the flow.  The banks of the island
are steep and lined with cold uninviting mud held in place by the roots of
mature green trees.  Curiously, there no snow is evident on the island.  To
the east, mighty wide plains spread out, covered in patchy snow, while the
western bank is steep, leading rapidly to a looming ridge.  A slick rocky
bank blocks passage to the west, but wide snowy plains open out to the east.

A Green Island~
Shortly up from the banks, a soft green grass takes hold, spreading over
the centre of the island, and an unusually soft breeze caresses the blades,
making them dance in strange lines.  Mature trees, their leaves a vibrant
emerald, line the banks of the island to form a lax ring, enough to protect
the island from outside prying eyes.  Very little snow is apparent, mostly
confined to deep, dark places such as between roots.  Small deep blue
flowers, their centres a strong gold colour, are sprinkled just inside the
ring of trees.  In the centre of the grass a shaped stone tableau glows a
soft green.

The cold water of the Hyloth flows around the stone buttresses of the

rock~
Straining your vision, you trace back the lie of the hand, and slowly you
make the outline of an enormous human figure, blended in with the cliff. 
The figure, locked in position, stands upright, staring out over the white
plains.  You trace the line down to the feet, each easily a human in height.
Moving closer, you observe an outline of a portal carved into the left foot,
barely different from the surrounding rock 
~

portal~
Lying almost flush with the grey stone, the faint outline of a portal
describes an arched shape about the height of a human.

Shielded Bank of the Hyloth River~
Spreading from the western ridge to the rapids to the east, this small
sliver of snow-covered earth is shielded from the erosive waters of the
Hyloth by a raised bank made of hard rock.  The high grey ridge-face is
dotted with small ledges, each covered with fresh, white snow, almost
appearing as a giant staircase.  A collection of arranged sticks and
branches pokes out over a ledge high on the ridge-face.

White Plains~
Icy snow covers the ground to ankle-height, the light reflected from it
is nearly painful to behold.  The land rolls gently under the white mantle,
and the dry wind sculpts the snow into small crescent-shaped drifts.  To the
east, a sharp rise in the land forms a natural escarpment, blocking passage.

Near a Rapidly Flowing Ford~
Rolling snow-covered plains butt up against the wild Hyloth rapids, a
border of snowy rock keeping the two separate.  A part of the plains begins
to descend, funnelling towards a slow point in the rapids, where it appears
possible to cross on foot.  The whistling wind intermingles with the sound
of the rapids, seemingly all that can be heard in this bleak land.  Wide

loose rocks from the embankment litter the ground, hidden by the snow.  A
dark hole gapes from the embankment, almost at tall as an Alatharya, from
which an unusual high-pitched squealing noise emanates.  A spur of the
mountains juts into the plains to the north, dominated by a single peak, its
apex concealed by clouds.

Near the Jyarks~
The frozen northern plains butt up against the bluffs that form the base
of the Jyark mountains, dwelling quietly under their ancient gaze.  Deep
drifts of snow accumulate at the base of the bluffs, slipped from their
rounded tops.  Bright winds whistle across the otherwise serene plains,

Scrubby Bank of the Hyloth~
Wide frozen plains peter out, slowly dipping towards the Hyloth river to
the west.  Small, stubborn shrubs dot the riverbank, defying the cold and
the ceaseless winds, the snow which pools around them.  Across the water, in
the middle of the river, lies a small island, thickly lined with trees
and lush greenery, an odd departure from the barren patchy white landscape
spreading away from the river.

A Black Monolith~
The gentle rolling plains lie pierced here by a great black needle,
punching through the surface of the earth and high into the sky.  Snow lies
embanked around its base, collected there by the wind, and not a single
plant can be seen within a hundred paces.  An uneasy sentiment exudes from
the monolith, making all those near uncomfortable.  Frozen, patchy plains
stretch out in all directions, and the wind seems a little duller here than
nearby.

The monolith seems beyond black, it is difficult to see more than one
shade of it, seeming almost as if you are staring at a flat rent in the
fabric of the world.  Defining its nature, though, myriad upon myriad of
intricate runes line the surface, the edges of the larger ones picked out by
snow settling in the carvings.  Just at the side of your sight, the runes
seem to twist and change, but as you focus upon them, they appear no
different to the last you looked.

The mountains on either side refuse to meet, allowing a wide, curved

Top of a Black Monolith~
The end of the monolithic needle comes sharply, the slim, steep sides
suddenly tapering in to a vicious, sharp point, kept well clear of snow,
despite the complete lack of air movement here.  A very uneasy feeling
spreads from the point of the monolith, almost overpowering you, and the air
almost drips with power.  The sheer blackness of the monolith stands in
bright contrast to the snowy white plains below.  An unparalleled viewing
point, you can see lie the Karacha woods in the distance to the south-west,
the Jyarks rise from the plains to the east, and far to the south, the
mighty Brintors dominate the lands.

the runes themselves would reject anything that dares to fill them.

Huddled together as a ward against the extreme environment, the fir trees
make quite a sharp borderline with the plains.  Appearing almost as

increasing towards the centre.  Snow settles on the upper reaches of most of
the mature trees, giving a layered effect, but the floor of the Karacha is
curiously clear of snow.  Bushy undergrowth takes advantage of the respite
from frozen ground, and almost chokes the woods.  Despite this, there is
much freedom of movement between the trees.

Mighty firs stretch high, struggling to outpace each other, but kept in

tighter here than near the edges of the woods, creating a sanctuary from the

Dark green parasitic vines lazily wrap around the firs, oblivious to the
protection provided by their hosts.  In some places the forest floor is
devoid of undergrowth, snow, anything but debris fallen from the firs.

The Karacha Woods~
Mighty firs stretch high, struggling to outpace each other, but kept in
check by the harsh weather outside the Karacha.  The press of mature firs is
tighter here than near the edges of the woods, creating a sanctuary from the
winds outside, but also smothering all but the most vigorous undergrowth. 
Dark green parasitic vines lazily wrap around the firs, oblivious to the
protection provided by their hosts.  In some places the forest floor is
devoid of undergrowth, snow, anything but debris fallen from the firs. 
There seems to be ample room to move here, and a light breeze is omnipresent
here.

Edge of the Karacha Woods~
Huddled together as a ward against the extreme environment, the fir trees
make quite a sharp borderline with the plains.  Appearing almost as
children, the trees on the edge are smaller, the height of the woods
increasing towards the centre.  Snow settles on the upper reaches of most of
the mature trees, giving a layered effect, but the floor of the Karacha is
curiously clear of snow.  Bushy undergrowth takes advantage of the respite
from frozen ground, and almost chokes the woods.  Despite this, there is
much freedom of movement between the trees.

Hut Amongst the Boughs~
Roughly-cut wooden slats filled with daub compose the walls of this
small, cramped dwelling, its single egress point covered by a large hide
flap.  Small tendrils of dark green vine curl around the doorway, loathe to
enter a place with no food.  A long pile of odorous skins and hides, some
uncured, line the west wall, potentially a place for the none-too-fussy to
sleep, and a small rough box sits next to it, covered in various furs. 
Strewn about the floor are various bone tools for skinning animals and
scraping the hides, and a bundle of poorly-made arrows sits in a far corner.

Rocky Enclosure~
The firs of the Karacha break suddenly, brought to a halt by the sudden
rocky terrain, which rises slowly to meet the sheer bluffs that help form
the foothills of the Brintors.  The blanket of patchy snow once again
descends to ground level, no longer supported by the woods, and falls on the
bluff-face forming odd little patterns.  The bluffs running from the west
around to the south slightly enclose the rocky ground, mildly protecting it
from the wind.

The Bandit\@s Lair~
Once picked for its proximity to the old Shendaer road, this cave has
seen many generations of bandits.  Now, with the decline of Shendaer, the
bandits must travel further for lesser reward.  The smell of roasted meat
permeates the air, which is warm from a fire banked near the centre of the
cave.  Light tendrils of smoke stains the ceiling, building up a greasy
blanket, before working its way to the mouth of the cave, and swirls gently
outwards.  Around the fire, odd cooking items lie in a haphazard fashion,
and several piles of uncured hides lay about, assumedly for bedding.  Deeper
into the cave, a small ice-cold pool rests, less than a foot across, but
constantly fed by trickles of water running down the slimy green rock above
it.

the ceiling, and eventually flowing up the corridor to find its exit.  Small
kankoran effigies lie half-made against the north wall, along with cured
hides and various tools to work them.  A pile of thick, soft furs, somewhat
worn in the centre, lies along the southern wall, looking to make a very

Icy Plains~
A thin, broken sheet of snow lines the surface of the ground, failing to
conceal it from view.  The earth that is visible sits heavily, covered in a
patina of ice and slush, and small dark green plants sit in clumps, defying
the will of the chilled ground.  A fresh wind seems omnipresent here, almost
always blowing from the north.  The bluffs at the foot of the Jyarks pass
nearby to the south-east.

Near the Jyarks~
The frozen northern plains butt up against the bluffs that form the base
of the Jyark mountains, dwelling quietly under their ancient gaze.  Deep
drifts of snow accumulate at the base of the bluffs, slipped from their
rounded tops.  Bright winds whistle across the otherwise serene plains,
chilling all that lies exposed.

A Slim Gully~
The pathway shows more evidence of being made by some ancient
watercourse, the shape of the high walls marked by the round carving of
water.  The gentle rise ceases here, in a shallow snow-filled depression
beneath the east face.  Wide, rough steps have been carved into the east
face, their centres smoothed from the passage of many feet.  The steps
zig-zag up, seemingly without pattern, following the line of least
resistance along the cliff-face.

A Dry Waterfall~
Wide, rough steps line the east face of the gully, allowing passage for
the earthbound.  Curiously free of snow, their dryness is about the only
safe point - no railing is provided to prevent a fall to the gully floor
far, far below.  The opposite wall curves a little closer near the top of
the gully, and seems near enough to touch.  Certainly, a thrown stone would
reach the other side before reaching the apex of its flight.

Top of a Dry Waterfall~
Dry, rough stone steps lead down from a short narrow gorge leading from
the east.  Once, a watercourse ran through here, evidenced by the smooth
rocks near what would have been the lip of a waterfall.  Very little snow
lies about, certainly, there is none between the steps and the path that
runs along the short gorge to the east.  The wall on the opposite side of
the slim gully has stops a little short, allowing an unparalleled view
across the northern plains.  Through the gorge, glimpses of deep blue water
can be seen, and tendrils of steam escape to meet the clouds above.

A Stony Beach~
A small lake stretches north from the stony beach here, lined by tall,
rocky snow-capped walls.  Steam rises from the quiet waters, slinking its
way up to join the clouds high above, and the heat in this place gradually
seeps into you, soon chasing away any vestiges of chill.  Water, snow melted
by the warm ground here, wends its way towards the lake in hundreds of tiny
rivulets, but is absorbed by the stony beach before reaching its
destination.  The waters themselves present a vibrant deep sapphire blue, a
strong colour bizarre in this pale land.  The gorge walls lining the stony
beach are high, yet shallow, allowing long daylight hours, and the steam
thickens the lean air, making it far more breathable, even relaxing.  Across
the lake, to the north-east, a low cave can be seen.

A Steaming Lake~
Warm waters emanate a gentle vapour into the chill mountain air, soothing

sapphire blue, rippling slightly in the mild breeze crossing the lake. 
Gently sloping rocky walls demarcate the lake all around, barring a
collection of stones to the south, which acts as a beach of sorts.  A slight
salty smell suggests minerals in the waters, strong enough to be unpotable,
and small blue crystals encrust the waterline.

Steam Cave~
From a stone arch leading out to a sapphire blue lake to the west, the
ceiling rises slightly before dropping gently do meet the surface of the
water lining the base of the cave.  At its apex, the cave roof is low enough
to make a nefortu hunch, should they want to avoid getting wet.  Warm vapour
rises from the water\@s surface, filling the cave, making it almost
impossible to breathe.  The cave itself glistens with small deep blue
crystals, particularly along the waterline, but also small stalactites of
the crystal drop from the roof.

Narrow Crevice~
The heat here is immense, radiating from the strong mineral waters all
around you.  The light here is weak and wan, barely penetrating the dark
waters, heightening the burden of oppression.  The walls are laced with a
dark green algae, some deposits thicker than a hand, and in certain areas,
it looks to have been nibbled at by the small lizards that populate the
lake.  Shortly, it becomes too narrow for any to pass through, but certainly
continues deep into the heart of the mountains.

melts.  A partially collapsed guardhouse to the east sits in watch over the

unforgiving and silent.  The path, however, lies oblivious to this, though
marred in some places by small rockslides.

The Shendaer Overlook~
The path wends its way through the mountains, seeking the way of least
resistance, but always wide enough to accommodate cart-sized traffic.  From
a vantage point high on one mountainside, a view of the broken city of
Shendaer spreads out to the south-east, the last before entering the
mountains.  Dark, twisted forest seems to half-envelop Shendaer, pierced by
the Tower, the focal point of the once-proud city.

Path to the Shendaer Pass~
A relatively smooth, wide path leads along the mountainside to the west,
and rises gently to meet the Brintors as they swing about to the north.  Few
twisted trees sprinkle the path, becoming more sparse with the climb into
the mountains, yet their understated menace gives them a most certain
presence.  Strangely quiet, not even the occasional shrill cry of an avian
can be heard, and the air itself seems afraid to announce itself.

Path Leading to the Mountains~
The forest starts to strip away from the mountainside, leaving only a few
twisted, menacing trees lining the path leading into the mountains.  All is
quiet...  Too quiet.  Not even the light wind makes a noise as it passes
through the leaves of the trees, and even the sounds you make seem muffled. 
Northwards lies the beginning of the disused Shendaer Pass.

Abandoned Stables~
Broken tiles lay strewn about, scattered by some unseen hand.  Rough
stone walls seem the only part of this room resistant to the harsh
conditions.  Cold wind blasts through the doorways, long since rotted from
their supports, and a crumbling well can be seen in the yard to the east. 
The roof, once high, has collapsed in the north end of the room, crushing
four stalls.  Three stalls line the south wall, and a large square hole can
be seen in the floor of the easternmost stall.

Abandoned Longroom~
The skeleton of the guardhouse longroom points thin wooden fingers
towards the sky where the roof has fallen near the door leading to the
ravine.  The collapsed roof provides a floor of piled, broken tiles, with
sharp edges that shift under your weight.  A hollow wind whistles between
the exposed support-posts, whipping around the low stone foundations of the
walls.  Thoroughly looted, little stands in the rest of the longroom, a worn
shelf here, a rotten bench there.  Only the solid fireplace in the southern
wall seems impervious to decay.

Abandoned Office~
Better preserved than the other rooms, there seems to be a quiet
malevolence pervading the room.  The room itself is rather spartan, and
seems to have been spared the ransacking that spread elsewhere in the
guardhouse.  An old, old desk is placed near the dead fireplace in the north
wall, and a bed, collapsed in the middle, lies against the south wall. 
Little trinkets adorn shelves about the room, but most have become dull and
useless with age.  The shuttered window, though old, is still performs its
duty, keeping out the chill winds, a task failed by the rotting door, half
off its hinges.

Dry Well~
Lying just beyond the stable wall, a circular wall of stones marks the
upper end of a well.  Once, a wooden eave protected the well, now it lies
splintered in pieces by its side.  Little scraps of wood and aged supplies
lie hard up against the stable wall, protected by an eave of their own,
sagging in the middle.

A room as long as the main hall, much of the same depredation has
occurred here.  Though the walls are intact, the entire southern end of the

Crumbled Cellar~
Partially filled with loose detritus from the fallen stable roof, the

green blanket of some kind of plant growth.  A small area against one wall,
about seven feet long, has been cleared of rubbish, and an old disused

Wide frozen plains peter out, slowly dipping towards the Hyloth river to

Ruins on the Scrub Plains~
Sparse knee-high scrub grasses fight with patchy snow for dominance of
the plains.  Where one falters, the other takes over.  The result is a stark
dark-green and grubby-white contrast, spreading across the slightly soft
earth.  Incessant winds churn the sharp-edged grasses, constantly testing
their thick stalks for strength.  

Within the grass, a half-circle of tall stone pillars stands.  The bases of
each appear to be made of a very old, weather worn rock, while their
intricately decorated columns appear to be relatively new.  Five statues of
animals are situated between each of the pillars, each one posed as if in
action.  At the center of the half-circle is a single ancient pillar, whose
shaft is decorated with primitively-drawn scenes of the ancient plains. 
Directly before the ancient pillar is a similarly ancient statue of a
snarling wolf.

pillar at the center of the half-circle.

This trout looks to be caught in mid-leap from the surface of some unseen
water, its body forming a graceful c-curve in the air.

Scrub Plains~
Sparse knee-high scrub grasses fight with patchy snow for dominance of
the plains, where one falters, the other takes over.  The result is a stark
dark-green and grubby-white contrast, spreading across the slightly soft
earth.  Incessant winds churn the sharp, pointy grasses, constantly testing
their thick stalks for strength.  A serene pool lies to the south, almost
choked with reeds, and beyond it lie the Brintor Mountains.  To the east, a
mighty fir tree stands alone.

The Fir~
Interrupting the low scrub and occasional desiccated trees that cover the
plains here, a lone fir tree towers, mighty enough to be seen for miles
around, growing vigorously despite the poor soil.  The branches sweep wide,
even touch the ground at the edges, and spread out far enough at the base
that a herd of caribou could be kept within, with room to spare for the
herder and family.  Sloughed snow creates a small wall encircling the tree,
and an arch of branches creates an opening within the canopy, which is
sealed with a hide door.  A circular red rock sits before the Fir, with
rough-hewn sides and a glass-smooth upper surface.  A small, quiet pool lies
to the south-west, filled with reeds, and the mighty Brintor range envelop
the southern horizon.  Elsewhere, scrubby plains stretch out from the Fir.

Standing mighty and solitary on the windy plain, the Fir is a testament

and even the basest of these sweep low to the ground.  A low arch-shaped gap
in these base branches allows ingress to the Fir\@s mighty bole.

Sparse knee-high scrub grasses fight with patchy snow for dominance of
the plains, where one falters, the other takes over.  The result is a stark
dark-green and grubby-white contrast, spreading across the slightly soft
earth.  The mighty Brintors stretch out to the south, commanding all of the
horizon that way, their foothills and bluffs rolling slowly down towards the
plains.  A single, tall fir lies to the west, towering high over the low
vegetation of the plains.

Within the Fir~
An acidic scent tinges the air, mixing with the smoke of a small fire
embedded in a well-lined firepit.  Overhead, the boughs of the fir entwine
themselves into complex patterns, splitting and splitting again, shortly
becoming too thick for even the most determined to climb.  The floor around
the firepit has been swept clear of the fir needles that make a loose carpet
under the branches, and it appears that the area is often slept in by many. 
The only light penetrating the tree is provided by the firepit, and there is
much-needed respite from the endless winds here.

A Stone Shelf~
Perched just under the high cliffs that border the Hyloth, this stone
shelf gives a view over the southern parts of the northern plains.  With the
Hyloth running a little ways down to the west providing a wild roar of
sound, you can see far out to the north.  Just underneath the shelf, a
quiet, reed-filled pool makes a serene counterpoint to the adjoining river. 
On the other side of the pool, a single fir tree rises high, and beyond it
the wide snowy plains reach out to the horizon.  The Hyloth wends its way
from you to its journey\@s end somewhere beyond sight, sidling up to a wide
ridge far to the northwest for the latter part of its journey.  Little else
is notable against the wide, scrubby plains, barring a small woods in the
distance to the east, plastered against the bluffs.

Under the Peak of Mount Khorak~
Thin dry air continues to make breathing difficult, especially combined
with the wind whipping around the mountain.  From this point, you can see a
partial view of the Brintor foothills, their blues and whites still a
breathtaking sight even when restricted.  In the distance to the west, you
see signs of smoke in the clear mountain air which must originate from the
hearths of Krilin Fortress.  The path continues around the mountain, not yet
showing a decline in altitude.  

Above you, upon the peak of the mountain, is a large statue of a howling
wolf.  Its head is tilted back toward the stars and its eyes are closed,
giving it a rapturous look of freedom.  Around its feet are carved a number
of dynamic lines made to represent the wind that persistently blows about
the peak.  Just underneath it are set four runes, one pointing in each of
the cardinal directions, which represent earth, air, fire, and water.  Along
the lower edge of the runes is inscribed, in both kankoran and common, a
phrase detailing the tenets of Girikha\@s followers.

The thin dry air here makes breathing unusually difficult, but does
nothing to quell the astonishing view south over the Brintors.  Blues and
whites spread out before you, and you can see the major paths of the
Brintors as tiny ribbons.  To the south of the peak lies a stockaded
village, the inhabitants large enough to pick out individually, even at this
range.  In the far distance, the Arien Plains appear as a wide smear across
the horizon.  Above you, to the north, the peak of Mount Khorak rises, laden
heavily with snow, like the path you now walk.  The air seems very still,
and unnaturally quiet.

stone has fallen through into the icy Hyloth beneath.  Spreading out to
either side, the trail for which this bridge was built lies equally
unwanted, and the Hyloth snakes northwards to meet a great ridge rising in
that direction.  To the south, the source of the Hyloth seems to source from
within the Brintors, which swallow the entire southern horizon.

almost indistinguishable from the patchy snow and plant-life that covers it,
and is more obvious by far from the stone markers that line its length. 
South of here, the land grows marshy and soft, under the patchy snow, and
north a short plain lies before a great ridge rises to dominate the horizon,
ending only where the Hyloth cuts into its side.

Here, a trail comes to an intersection, if such can be called that, and a
large marker stone lies at the crossroad.  A well-maintained trail connects
the southern path, running along the base of the western foothills, to a
steep western path rising into the same.  The eastern path, much disused and
not maintained, heads towards an old bridge, just visible in the distance. 
North of here, patchy snow appears to gain a stronger grip on the land, and
before long, a great ridge rises taking up much of the northern horizon.

A trail lies etched into the lightly-snowed plains, companioned by a
series of markers, and runs near a line of steep foothills, forming part of
a north-bound mountainous spur eminant from the Brintors.  More
well-maintained than well-used, the trail seems to see more foot and
pack-animal traffic than wheeled.  Each marker is clearly enscripted, and
some show signs of renewal from weathering from the endless winds that howl
by.  To the east, the ground becomes soft and marshy under its patchy white
mantle.

A Small Bog~
Very soft, marshy ground here adjoins the slow Hyloth to the east. 
Mosses and reeds, bent by the winds, dominate the bog, which help the earth
to some stability, but not much.  Within the reeds, croaks of small
creatures can be heard, odd to hear in these desolate plains.  The bog seems
slightly warmer than the earth about it, though not much, and may be why
little snow can be seen here.  The sodden earth seems to threaten any ground
creature with great impedance to their movement.

A Well-used Trail~
A trail lies etched into the lightly-snowed plains, companioned by a
series of markers.  More well-maintained than well-used, the trail seems to
see more foot and pack-animal traffic than wheeled.  Each marker is clearly
enscripted, and some show signs of renewal from weathering.  Here the trail
runs from the east to butt up against high foothills that form part of a
mountainous spur eminant from the Brintors.  The trail then turns to run to
the north.

Wide Bank~
Patchy snow and chilled grasses compete for dominance here, the grasses
seeming to slowly be taking the upper hand.  Slow, gentle banks allow easy
access, through a break in the reeds, to the Hyloth River, as it makes its
way from the east around to the north.  A well-used path lies to the west,
its distance markers painting its course.  To the south, a long stone

Near the Foothills~
The snow-sprinkled plains come to an end here, against a corner of the
Brintors.  A spur of the range forges north, its prominent peaks to the west
almost as great as the mighty southern peaks, visible even this close to the
steep foothills that would block view of smaller mountains.  A wide gap lies
open in a hillside to the south, and a small trail disappears into the hills
to the west.  Incessant winds blowing over the foothills make this place a
little uncomfortable.

A Stone Adjutment~
Slopes of rough scree sidle up to the southern bluffs that make the edge

adjutment, composed of a dark marbled rock.  Lying in the lee of the
adjutment, small grasses flourish, and on the east side of the stone, a
rapid descent to the Hyloth River is evident.  A well-used path lies to the

A Small Trail~
Not much more than an absence of obstacles, a thin trail wends its way
through the foothills, with little daylight admitted by the steep hills. 
Small trees and shrubbery start to fill the foothills, protected from the
harsher elements of the plains.  The trail itself ends just outside a small
hole under an outcropping, barely big enough to admit a human.  Tendrils of
smoke emerge from the hole, soon obliterated by the light winds.

A crackling fire sits at the lowest point of this cave, shaped like a

with small pock-marks, although the areas around the mouth and fire seem
smoothed with use.  Some game seems to be roasting over the fire, and a
small palette of clean furs seems to form a bed near it.  A thin haze fills
most of the cave, as the ventilation is adequate, but not complete.  A small
barrel filled with fresh water sits near the entrance.

End of the Krilin Pass~
The long pass comes to a conclusion here, as the canyon walls separate
and melt away, opening to the wide northern plains.  The stable to a Krilin
Guardhouse lies west of here, its steeply pitched slate roof still covered
in snow.  Blasts of cold air greet those you gaze to the open plains, giving

Outside a Krilin Guardhouse~
A long low guardhouse to the east runs parallel to the pass, its slate
roof steeply pitched to slough off excess snow.  Warm yellow light emerges
from grease-covered windows, offering a source of comfort against the cold. 
A stout oaken door provides access to the guardhouse.  Rising from the roof,
a tower allows views over the canyon walls, as they lower towards the end of
the pass, and out over the plains beyond.  The pass continues north and

Though not quite cold, these stables are not warm, either, yet they are
well sealed from the outside weather.  Four stalls line the north wall, one
filled with several bales of old hay, another with sacks of grain, and three
line the south wall.  A small mezzanine loft has been constructed, and seems
to hold light tools of uncommon use.  A door in the south leads to the

Sitting in a corner formed by the guardhouse and the canyon wall, a well
has been sunk into the earth.  Surmounted by a small gabled roof, it is of
the winch-and-bucket type, and though sturdy, it seems quite old.  Behind
the stable door lies a great woodpile, easily the height of a human,

Grimy tapestries and iron lamps line the walls of this longroom, and a
fire burns brightly in a wide fireplace to the south.  Four rough pine
tables lie along the walls, adorned with polish-rags, whetstones and other
assorted soldiers\@ kit.  A small bronze clock set in a shield sits on the
mantlepiece, flanked by whittled statues of wolves.  The whole room seems
laced with an essence of lamp-grease, result of long dark hours within the
pass.  A wooden ladder disappears through a hole in the ceiling, and there
are doors in each wall.

Guardsmen\@s Quarters~
Running along the length of the longroom, this room quarters the men that
staff the guardhouse.  Ten canvas cots line the long walls, and at the foot
of each stands a small cabinet, made of rough pine.  Under each cot there
has been stacked extra cloths and bedding, as if to ward off any night chill
from seeping in.  Knife-marks appear in the mortar of the walls above some
of the cots, and in one place, the mortar has been plugged with an old rag.

Situated next to the chimney of the great fireplace of the longroom
below, there is a little warmth within this guardroom.  Little lies in the
way of comfort, though, only two hard wooden chairs, one with a
hand-stitched cushion upon it.  Half the room is used for storage, being too
big in the original design for its intended purpose.  Shutters open out to
the west and south, overlooking Krilin Pass, and to the north, overlooking
the southern parts of the plains and the trail that disappears into them. 
Long since lost their glass, the windows are usually kept well shuttered,
and only opened for short periods.  A ladder provides a way down to the
longroom.

Although spartan, the furniture in this room bears the mark of

corner, absorbing the heat emanating from the back of the longroom
fireplace, stopping short of a door in the north wall.  An oaken desk lies
against the south wall, writing implements and papers neatly squared away. 
A small window looks out over the path outside, but nothing can be seen
through the crust of snow covering it.  Standing in one corner, a wooden

curves up to form the walls, and the ground is littered with smoothed rocks,
almost covering the sinkhole.  To the south, a path descends to the gully

loses out to scrub growing to the north-west, fighting all the way.  A short

Icy Scrub~
Slowly the snows here give way to low scrubby bushes, looking too frail
and sickly to survive in the wastes, almost as if they were pushed from the
thicker scrubland further northwest.  Drifts of snow still pile and engulf
the unlucky greenery, yet some respite is had from the winds of the open
plains, afforded by the wide ridge to the north, and the mountainous spur to
the west.

Broken Plains~
Thin sword-like grasses grow in patches here, fighting each other amidst
rocky ground, and the snow quickly covers any unwanted ground.  The reeds
gradually grow thicker towards the bed of the Hyloth River, flowing steadily
to the south-east.  Slowly the ground rises towards the ridge to the north,
stopping short at the base of a rise which leads to the crown of the ridge.

Icy Scrubland~
Dense scrub curls around the landscape, flowing from one shrub to
another, making foot travel difficult.  Light patches of snow lie caught in
the upper branches of the larger shrubs, weakening them so that more virile
competitors may take their place, and the skeletons of small animals lie at
their bases, their ribs crunching dryly underfoot.  Slowly, the scrubland
becomes more dense to the west, where twisted, pained oaks bend in shapes
uneasy to the eye.

Icy Scrub~
Sickly, frail scrub fights both snow and scree for purchase in the lee of
the ridge, almost as if they were pushed from the thicker scrubland further

the pains of winds of time lost, and curls upwards to the east, allowing

Thin snow covers most of the land here, broken occasionally by clumps of

form a steep bank against the Hyloth to the east.  A small island site
squarely in the centre of the flow, forcing the river to move around it, and
its shores lie thick with dark vegetation, making an unusual sight in these
bleak lands.  To the north, the Hyloth moves to press hard against the
ridge, etching its bed close to it, and a narrow strip of stone, barely ten
feet across, runs between them.

Narrow Stone Ledge~
Wedged tightly in between the cliff-face rising high to the west and the
cold waters of the Hyloth below to the east, the ledge feels a little more
precarious than it is.  Sturdy grey stone lies underfoot, blemished with the
odd deep crack, rising almost seamlessly into the ridge wall beside you. 
Northward, the ledge dips and widens slightly, and south, gradually opens to
the plains.

Narrow Stone Bank~
Grey stone angles between the Hyloth waters to the east and the ridge
wall opposite, slick with spray from the river.  A wide, rough-cut stone
staircase lies carved into the ridge, angling first one way, then back, as
the carvers negotiated the steep climb.  Worn by the elements, and cracked
with time, there is no mistaking that the steps are, or were, often used,
their centres worn smooth by the passage of many feet.  The river opposite
this point seems shallow enough to negotiate by foot, and the stone ledge
narrows and rises slightly both north and south.

furrowed by time.

Rise Before the Plateau~
The southernmost point of the great ridge stands out, overlooking the
plains in all directions, sweeping in the view of the blue-purple Brintors
to the west, around over the plains to the south, backed again by the
Brintors, which stretch far to the east, becoming gradually whiter as they
move north.  A sliver of water cuts sharply through the snowscape to the
east, its moving waters resisting the pull of ice.  Strong winds blow from
the north, curling over the ridge, which deigns to descend, sharply to the
south at first, then gently to the west.

Eastern Cliffs~
Blistering winds sear the edge of the ridge, tearing away loose rock and
any snow that may have fallen, leaving bare rock, interspersed with boulders
too heavy to budge.  The cliffs here command a view of a fast-flowing
river at the cliff\@s base, out over wide white plains, endless to the
horizon.  To the west, a plateau opens out, forming a very slight
bowl-shaped depression.

Northwestern Cliffs~
Broken and rough, the ridge here provides unstable footing, especially
when combined with the eternal winds blasting up and over the cliff-top. 
Looking down over the cliffs, a small cove of dark, icy water makes inroads
into the ridge, although it is uncertain whether or not access to the cove

Above the Cove~
The great ridge begins to thin as it moves northward, as a cove of dark
water pushes its west side closer to the eastern cliffs.  The ridge becomes
a little less broken as it thins, and more openly exposed.  Biting winds
flurry up from the cove, almost completely overpowered by the roaring
northern winds, howling up over the not too distant northern cliffs, and the
constant change of direction makes it hard to stay stable.

Northeastern Cliffs~
The ridge comes to its northern limits here, and it is almost as if the

fairly sharply down, yet the shoreline beneath cannot be observed in safety
due to the incessant gusts.  However, the dark, northern sea spreads out
before you, blue chunks of wind-carved ice occupying more than a third of
what you see.  The ridge runs thinner to the north, with the northern sea on
one side, and the dark cove pressing against the other.

Crest of a Ridge~
The crest of the ridge runs thin and high, weaving back and forth, and
screaming winds threaten your stability, rising on both sides, shifting
unpredictably.  To the south, a deep, dark cove lies hundreds of feet below,
a dark blot grinning an uneasy welcoming smile.  To the north, the northern
sea spreads for almost as far as you can see, seemingly populated only by
bluish wind-carved ice sheets, which surmounts a surface so dark and
forbidding, it is almost palpable, even at this height.  Further along the

Before a High Tower~
The ridgeline comes to an end here, its thin sides finally running out,
punctuated by the appearance of a slender tower, jabbing into the sky with a
force equal to the blistering winds lashing around its sides from the north.
Starting from a solid base extending out past the ridge, the tower\@s
ice-blue stone walls swoop up, narrowing to about half the base width before
flaring out again.  The base seems set onto stone buttresses, though it is
unimaginable that masons would come here to perform such work.  All of the
few windows appear dark, but for a moderate-sized one about halfway up,
which seems to emit a welcomingly warm light.  A small arched door at the
base lies partly open, seemingly jammed against some internal tile.

Shore of a Dark Cove~
A thin, stony beach is all that keeps the ominous black waters from
eating voraciously into the side of the ridge.  Lined with ice, the stones
themselves are loose and slippery, and falling into the sea would certainly
be painful.  Rocky cliffs surround the cove, although a thin trail leads
upwards in one place, for those strong enough in courage to attempt the
climb.  The shore dies away near the mouth of the cove, although an icy
ledge follows the waterline outside the cove.

The cave appears to have been hollowed out through extra work by some

Abandoned Foyer~
Wisps of wind seep in through an open door to the south, opened halfway,
and jammed amidst loosened tiles.  Decay and neglect are obvious within the
foyer, as old tapestries that once line the walls now hang half-off their
hooks, and are so faded that it is only possible to tell their predominant
colours: blue.  Small furniture lies in ruins, organic parts long since
rotted, and metal parts falling in a heap around them.  A spiral staircase,
perhaps wide enough for a human and a half, curls anti-clockwise up the
tower, starting from due east.  Under the stairs to the north, a banded oak
door still sits in place, and a similar door lies to the west, partly
covered with ruins of furniture.  Further under the stairs, a trapdoor sits
with a heavy beam of wood lying across it.  In the dead centre of the tower
lies a mosaic of an iceburst, and looking up from there, you can see the
entire height of the tower.

Oubliette~
The deep oubliette lies directly beneath the trapdoor, the black metal
walls glistening with faintly glowing glyphs, providing an even, unsettling
glow.  Upwards, the smooth walls slowly grow towards the trapdoor, smooth
and offering no purchase.  Indeed, as you place your hand close to the wall,
you notice that it stops half al inch short of it.  Somehow, this metal
canister feels cut-off from the surrounding world.  

Mad, disjointed etchings are somehow carved in the black metal of the wall.

You stare at the etchings, soaking in the full extent of their sprawl.  

Long minutes pass, and just as you are about to give up in frustration, an
insight strikes you.  

Feverishly, you follow the pattern of the glyphs and symbols in the piece,
unable to look away.  You grasp for enlightenment, and the oubliette fades
from sight......  



An unending waste spreads in all directions, a gray desolation devoid of any
color or hope.  Long lines of mortal beings -- humans, ethron, and aelin,
all kneel on the ground.  Each of them is engaged in a fervent chant, and
each of them scrawls the same unending, mad etchings in the soil.  

Horrified, you realized that the eyes of these beings have been scooped out,
revealing gaping sockets.  Their fingers are little more than grisly nubs,
locked in the never ending pattern of their devotion.  

Strangely compelled, you kneel yourself, and begin scrabbling the symbols in
the sand.  Somehow, you know, this will bring you enlightenment.  Somehow,
you will be the one devoted enough to perfect the pattern.  Resolute, you
begin again, your hands following the same lines, over and over....  

Your vision clears, and the Mad Etchings have burned their pattern into your
mind.

Disused Kitchen~
This kitchen curves to fit the form of the tower, making unnecessary work
for any cook to use it.  Stout oaken tables have stood the test of time,
their surfaces scored from many decades of use.  A hearth lies to one side,
a magical flame burning evenly at its base, the blackened cauldron that once
hung over it now lying deformed at its base.  Tarnished kitchenware hangs
all over the inner walls, and along the outer wall a series of three windows
show stark views of the outside environs, and seem to be made of something
far stronger than glass.

Curving to fit the turn of the tower, this room seems perhaps a little
larger than normal for an apprentice, yet it is unmistakably so from the
nave decorations adorning the room, now tired with age.  A narrow bed, its
mattress mouldered, sits hard up against one wall, and next to it looks an
unused writing-desk.  Opposite, a bookcase half-full of mouldered books
sits, small piles of old green paint lying at its foot.  A series of three
windows gives a strong view over the northern sea, cold and forbidding.  The
room is quite chilly, and a waist-high brazier sits ready to receive fuel to
burn for warmth.

Dilapidated Landing~
The internal stairs cease to rise for a short time, the landing they form
first stopping at a solid banded door in the north wall, then curving around
to a similar door in the south wall opposite.  A weakened wooden handrail

Master\@s Bedroom~
Curving around a good half of the tower, the Master\@s bedroom was built
for opulence, yet the furnishings are more modest.  A wide bed, bordered in
oak, sits out from one wall, its blue silken canopy partially fallen from
its supports.  Washing stands, dressing table, garderobe and the like are
all well-built, but more to pragmatics than beauty.  A long wide window,
rotten drapes pulled aside, gives an excellent view over the dark northern
sea, replete with ice floes.  A small magical fire burns in a grating,
removing the edge of cold from the room, but not quite warming it in the
process.

Master\@s Study~
Comfortable warmth is a suprising encounter, as warm air swirls around
the room thanks to a blazing fire burning magically in the firegrate, and
swirled magically with tiny eddies of air, focussed to be barely noticeable.
The room takes up the half of the tower opposite the Master\@s bedroom, and
is tastefully appointed in darkened oak and deep maroon leather, a little
aged, but still in good condition.  Small magical knick-knacks line shelves
and walls, prominent amongst them is a sturdy silver-bound chest lying near
the firegrate.  A lavishly appointed desk sits against the wall opposite to
the fire, sporting a leather writing surface and a dedicated lamp to light
it.

Dilapidated Landing~
The internal stairs cease to rise for a short time, the landing they form
first stopping at a solid banded door in the north wall, then curving around
to a similar door in the west wall.  A weakened wooden handrail ostensibly
stops a fall into the centre of the stairwell, but it looks untrustworthy. 
After the second door, the stairs continue spiralling on upward.  Small
flames burn in stone grooves in the wall to light the shaft.

Ransacked Library~
Cold and windowless, this library looks as if it has been ransacked,
books torn apart, and bookshelves toppled.  Once it may have been a
well-organised library, but now, perhaps, all that is left is good only for
kindling.  A waist-high table seems to be all that is relatively untouched,
tucked away in a far corner, with a small lantern spilling light from a
magical glow over it.

Ransacked Reagent Storeroom~
Slicing winds blow in through the shattered window, oddly it is perhaps
the only one in the entire tower, and spits of sleet fall in a small area
just inside it.  What was once a storeroom of the makings of magic, neatly
marked and stored now lie in great heaps, intermixed and beyond hope of use.
Great piles of ruined vials, metals, and rotted cloth sack adorn the room,
interspersed with similarly degraded crates.  A small firegrate to one side
seems to have been home to an explosion, looking unevenly carved and black
scorching surrounds it to a distance of two feet.  No fire burns there now.

Top of the Shaft~
The internal stairs come to a final landing here, which curls around
almost upon itself.  At the far end, a short staircase disappears through a
largish trapdoor in the buttressed stone ceiling.  The wooden handrail gives
out halfway around the landing, rotted slivers sprinkling the floor. 
Looking down the tower shaft, a great mosaic of an iceburst shows itself in
brilliant colours not evident from the ground floor.

Abandoned Workshop~
A large circular room sits atop the tower, with a high metal dome
surmounting it.  Tough, clear windows afford a spectacular panoramic view
sweeping all the way around the tower, from the ridge, over the dark cove
and dark, sinister northern sea, its wind-carved ice floes looking somehow
obscene, sweeping out over the wide white sheet that is the great northern
plains.  At this distance, even the mighty Hyloth river seems little more
than a weak ribbon.  The room itself lies filled with detritus, a curved
bench running the entire length of the window, covered with broken and
decayed alchemical apparatus, reagents, decayed grimoires and magical
mechanical contraptions.  A thin brass handrail surrounds on three sides a
trapdoor which leads down .  The room itself is lighted in the main by four
large brass braziers, topped with glowing white balls rather than burning,
one at each cardinal point.

A Steaming Lake~
Warm waters emanate a gentle vapour into the chill mountain air, soothing

sapphire blue, rippling slightly in the mild breeze crossing the lake. 
Gently sloping rocky walls demarcate the lake all around, barring a
collection of stones to the south, which acts as a beach of sorts.  A slight
salty smell suggests minerals in the waters, strong enough to be unpotable,

Mica Beach~
A rough pebble beach lies at the foot of the ridge, gazing out to the
wide ice floes to the north, the dark forbidding northern waters lapping at
its edge.  A blistering wind whistles over the floes, slapping into the
ridgeface before passing up over the cliff edge far above.  However, the
wind on the beach surface is much milder, calm enough as to not disturb a
candle flame.  In the ridgeface itself, a thick vein of mica has been
exposed, torn by the elements to spread glittering flakes down to cover the
beach, marking the pebbles underneath a glittering black.  Small motes of
mica move in the wind, chafing where they land on your skin.

Tumbling Crazily in the Air~
Twirling crazily in the air, your control over your aerial movements is
beyond your command, unable as you are to right yourself once more.  Images
fly by, clouds, icy plains, dark sea, forest, all so far from your grasp as
you are born aloft in your ephemeral spinning prison.  You are tossed in all
ways, chilled to the core by the tearing gale, but eventually start your
inevitable journey back to the hard, flat earth.

Tumbling Crazily Down a Mountain~
Spinning, tumbling, crashing down the side of Mount Khorak, you are
buffeted and rammed against rocky outcroppings as the rolling avalanche
consumes you and rolls on.  Spinning, tumbling, at one time all is white,
all is blue, all is grey, all is black, as you are tossed back and forth
between competing avalanche fronts.  Losing all recognition of direction,
you can only hope that the journey will soon end.

a blend of rocky outcrops and precipitous snow sheets.  To the south, the
snow gives way to rocky ground, which in turn shortly gives way to a thick
pine forest.

Thrumming away quietly beneath the peak of Mount Khorak, a gigantic

flanges, lights, levers, buttons and general whathaveyou, it spiders out
ice-cold tendrils the thickness of a human into several apertures in the
northern wall.  Small hairy creatures in blue overalls swarm all over the

The Anraynirs\@ Tower~
The tower, tiled in warm roseate marble, is but a single tall chamber. 
The ceiling is an airy dome of weathered green copper which is supported by
slender columns.  Stately clerestory windows between the columns admit a
wealth of light during daytime.  Set into the floor in the center of the
ring of columns is a wide pool.  Outside the ring of columns, basketed
plants, bookcases, and framed paintings establish a warm and comfortable
atmosphere.  A wooden staircase which begins along the western side of the
tower spirals upward, leading to lofts which form the main living and
working areas of the tower.  Set into the stone of the eastern wall is a
sturdy wooden door.

Chowderhead Plains~
Wide-roaming plains stretch in all directions as far as the eye can see,
and covering the lush plains in various clumps of human degenesis are
chowderheads of all kinds.  You\@ve often wondered just where these people
come from, have they come from a different planet, where have they been
these last few years while everyone else was getting clues.  Well, this is
where.  The breeding-grounds of chowderheads, aguing pointlessly with each
other, asking dumb-ass questions, and irritating each other, so much so,
that when they leave, they have a large chip on their shoulder, and have to
take it out on the world.

The Great Hall~
High vaulted ceilings and heavily fluted collonades dominate this hall,
all encrusted with precious artifacts and plated in seven precious metals. 
Nubile swashbucklers of both genders regale each other with tales in the
wings of the hall, each clad in silk and samite, and bearing a circlet of
roses.  A great red carpet runs the length of the main hall, guiding the eye
towards an expansive shrine filled with many offerings.  Light music trails
throught the hall, tugging at the soul heart with its promises of the
future.  The scent of fresh cut roses gently fills the hall, in perfect
harmony with the sunlight streaming in through rose-mosaic windows.

Shrine of Aeolis~
A single high dome soars above an elegant marbled floor, held in place by
thirteen white marble columns.  A magnificent hall extends to the south, and
between the columns an exquisite garden can be seen surrounding the shrine,
its wandering fragrance calming to the mind.  Clean-limbed youths in short
togas tend flourishing rose bushes near the shrine with reverence due a god.
The floor of the shrine forms a great seal, cast in red gold, a prayer to
Aeolis etched around its rim.  Within the circle proper lie supplications to
Aeolis, a small pile of humble requests, which just happen to include:

Rhaokarr\@s Study~
A crackling fire bathes this room in a warm, soft glow, making the
furniture appear to have a soft yellow grease upon it.  A heavy oak desk
sits opposite the fireplace, and a directional lamp set in the wall above it
issues a harsh white light.  Two chairs and a short couch flank the
fireplace, positioned for maximum warmth, and a small laquered table sits
between them, the chocolate mint on it melting slowly in the warmth.  Above
the wall over the fireplace, a pair of swords lie crossed, point downward, a
symbol of a life that once was.  Maps and papers cover the desk, and the
floor about it.

End of a Steep Ridge~
A small tower of pale stone stands alone on the snow-dusted craggy
promontory which forms the end of the ridge.  Off in the distance, vast ice
fields spread out to the north, dark waters interspersed with islands of
ice, and individual icebergs can be seen, their smooth shapes carved by the
wind.  The air is quite chill, and it is made doubly worse by the
unrelenting wind which continually whispers through the sparse pines.  A
small sliver of the plains lies in the lee of the ridge to the south.  The
ridge widens out and continues to the east.

Steep Ridge~
Small patches of icy snow litter the ridge here, nestling in the hollows
of the ground, as all exposed surfaces have been stripped nearly bare by the
biting winds howling from the north.  A few bedraggled pines, their sparse
needles encased in frosted icicles, have found a purchase along the slopes. 
In the distance, vast icefields stretch from the north-west around to the
east, sculpted by the wind into unusual baroque shapes, the waters around
them dark and menacing.  The ridge becomes a little more rocky to the west,
where it ends in a stark promontory.  The ridge also continues to the south.

be seen to the west, sheltering in the lee of the ridge, and beyond that, a
deep ravine scores the earth.  The ridge continues both north and south.  A
small cairn has been erected near the western cliff, snow gathering around

by an inexpert hand.

Rocky Ridge~
The ridge here narrows to a thin sliver, barely enough to travel along,
marked by the rising Jyark mountains to the east, and dropping away to the
wide plains to the west.  Small spiky plants jut out from cracks in the
ridge-face, growing where the wind cannot find them.  Snow and loose gravel
make the footing uncertain, and the ridge is absorbed by the mountain to the
south.

Entrance to the Caves~
A wide ridge rises up sharply to the north and gently to the east,
affording a little shelter from the ceaseless winds.  In the base of the
northern ridgeface, set low in the ground, lies a cave twice the height of a
human, its mouth sealed against the wind by a tatty blanket of hides.  The
area around the mouth of the cave looks well maintained, and swept free of
snow, which would otherwise threaten to engulf it.  The plains stretch out
to the south and west, a vast white expanse.

Antechamber~
Initially a natural grotto, this chamber has been slowly enlarged over
many years.  The walls are slightly smoothed, and still show signs of chisel
marks.  Three small braziers provide light, filling the room with a yellow
glow, yet not penetrating the darkness of the tunnel openings to the east. 
The inside of a hide door, stretched over a bone framework, can be seen
covering the cave entrance.  Small bundles of fuel for the braziers line the
northern wall, and above them, a glyph is drawn on the wall in charcoal.  A
wide-mouthed bronze urn, half-filled with small stones, lies on the edge of
the light, before the tunnels.
