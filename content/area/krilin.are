This large gray dog trots along the hallways of Krilin Fortress. 
Apparently owned by one of the hunters or trappers, the dog is a
well-muscled beast, its thick fur well-adapted to the harsh mountain
climates.  Several scars give testament to this dog\@s active history, and
its wary manner seems to indicate that it is experienced in dealing with
dangerous folk.  Still, its long tail wags happily, and it seems to be a
good-natured specimen.

emote coughs loudly.
\@Now then. There once was an old man named Harrak, living in a town not far from here.
\@Old Harrak, it seems, was very fond of his drink, and had run up quite a debt with the local tavern keeper.
emote grins cheerfully.
\@One day the tavernkeeper was reviewing his finances, and noticed that he was losing a large sum on Harrak\@s drinking.
//
\@Disgustedly, he called, \#Harrak! You have cost me 57 golds! You cannot drink here again until you bring them to me!\#
esay \@says in a conspiratorial tone\@ Now, it seems that Old Harrak was somewhat hard of hearing, and furthermore wasn\@t paying much attention to what the tavernkeeper said (until the part about \#can\@t drink here anymore\#).
//
\@As fate would have it, Harrak thought the tavernkeeper had said \#I have lost my 57 folds\#, and \#you must bring them to me\#.
emote chuckles lightly.
\@So Old Harrak went home, muttering to himself, \#I didn\@t even know he HAD 57 folds of sheep!\#, and thinking that he could do well to cut down drinking anyhow.
//
\@However, Harrak just couldn\@t help himself, and as his private stores rapidly dwindled, he realized that he would have to do some sheep-finding.
//
\@Harrak set out to the hills, and searched high and low. Eventually, he came upon two shepherds drinking rum. They kindly offered him a drink, and soon all three were passed out on the hillside.
//
\@When Old Harrak awoke, he had forgotten where he was. But looking around him, he was gratified to see a fold of sheep! So he quickly rounded them up and brought them to a safe place.
//
\@The next night, Harrak set out again, and came upon another pair of drinking shepherds. Sure enough, the morning found him with another fold in his possession.
//
\@He couldn\@t quite remember where he found it, but he was certain he was making significant progress toward restoring the tavernkeeper\@s lost sheep.
//
\@Very soon the disappearance of vast quantities of sheep came to the alarmed attention of the local baron. Infuriated by the apparent operation of a master bandit in his territory, the baron vowed to catch the culprit.
//
\@A famed thief-taker was hired to locate the missing animals and to bring justice to the criminals... Meanwhile, unwitting Harrak continued to \#find\# folds of sheep all around the countryside.
//
\@At last Harrak had gathered 57 folds of sheep in a secluded valley, and -- eagerly dreaming of the ale he would soon guzzle -- brought them to the tavernkeeper\@s home. Leaving the multitude of animals, he hastened to the tavern.
//
\@Nearly the very same moment, the relentless thief-taker invoked a powerful enchantment that revealed the location of the missing sheep, and reported that the culprit was a local tavernkeeper.
//
emote chortles and wipes a hand across his brow.
\@As Old Harrak thirstily worked his way to town, the infuriated baron\@s guards worked their way to the tavern.
//
esay \@finishes, nearly unable to speak for the chortling\@ Harrak arrived at the town square just in time to see the guards hauling the tavernkeeper off to prison, and putting the beloved tavern to the torch.

esay \@interjects suddenly, his voice thunderous\@ Until a loud yell and a boom echoed through the forest!
\@ \#Was that a death cry?\# He asked himself.
esay \@says slowly, as if savoring the feel of each word\@ Sweat started to pour, his hand started to shake.
\@ He heard a twig snap, and the thief ran.
\@ As fast as he could go, towards the other edge of the forest.

esay \@continues\@ He asked himself \#What is that smell?\#
esay \@says, wrinkling his nose with a slight grimace\@ Never to see the burnt corpse that he tripped over.
\@ And never to see the darkness behind him.

esay \@calls out\@ Gather round, friends! I\@ll tell the tale of Old Harrak and the 57 golds.
mpforce patron emote calls to Hjarmal for another round of ale.
emote $I coughs loudly.
\@Now then. There once was an old man named Harrak, living in a town not far from here.
\@Old Harrak, it seems, was very fond of his drink, and had run up quite a debt with the local tavern keeper.
emote grins cheerfully.
\@One day the tavernkeeper was reviewing his finances, and noticed that he was losing a large sum on Harrak\@s drinking.
\@Disgustedly, he called, \#Harrak! You have cost me 57 golds! You cannot drink here again until you bring them to me!\#
esay \@says in a conspiratorial tone\@ Now, it seems that Old Harrak was somewhat hard of hearing, and furthermore wasn\@t paying much attention to what the tavernkeeper said (until the part about \#can\@t drink here anymore\#).
\@As fate would have it, Harrak thought the tavernkeeper had said \#I have lost my 57 folds\#, and \#you must bring them to me\#.
emote chuckles lightly.
\@So Old Harrak went home, muttering to himself, \#I didn\@t even know he HAD 57 folds of sheep!\#, and thinking that he could do well to cut down drinking anyhow.
\@However, Harrak just couldn\@t help himself, and as his private stores rapidly dwindled, he realized that he would have to do some sheep-finding.
\@Harrak set out to the hills, and searched high and low. Eventually, he came upon two shepherds drinking rum. They kindly offered him a drink, and soon all three were passed out on the hillside.
\@When Old Harrak awoke, he had forgotten where he was. But looking around him, he was gratified to see a fold of sheep! So he quickly rounded them up and brought them to a safe place.
\@The next night, Harrak set out again, and came upon another pair of drinking shepherds. Sure enough, the morning found him with another fold in his possession.
\@He couldn\@t quite remember where he found it, but he was certain he was making significant progress toward restoring the tavernkeeper\@s lost sheep.
\@Very soon the disappearance of vast quantities of sheep came to the alarmed attention of the local baron. Infuriated by the apparent operation of a master bandit in his territory, the baron vowed to catch the culprit.
\@A famed thief-taker was hired to locate the missing animals and to bring justice to the criminals... Meanwhile, unwitting Harrak continued to \#find\# folds of sheep all around the countryside.
\@At last Harrak had gathered 57 folds of sheep in a secluded valley, and -- eagerly dreaming of the ale he would soon guzzle -- brought them to the tavernkeeper\@s home. Leaving the multitude of animals, he hastened to the tavern.
\@Nearly the very same moment, the relentless thief-taker invoked a powerful enchantment that revealed the location of the missing sheep, and reported that the culprit was a local tavernkeeper.
emote chortles and wipes a hand across his brow.
\@As Old Harrak thirstily worked his way to town, the infuriated baron\@s guards worked their way to the tavern.
esay \@finishes, nearly unable to speak for the chortling\@ Harrak arrived at the town square just in time to see the guards hauling the tavernkeeper off to prison, and putting the beloved tavern to the torch.
emote bows deeply, a wide grin on his face.

E
first~
The Swarm of Khudh\@itzu:

Conjuration of the swarm is a dangerous task, and is often saved as a last
resort.  The khudh\@itzu fly is a large, blood-sucking insect, native to the
demonic region of Xixzyr.  

Along with the dreadful loss of blood, the flies spread an unnatural plague.
Unfortunately, they possess only rudimentary intelligence, and seem immune
to control by mortal scholars.  

The swarms are attracted to animal blood, smeared in the sign of the Cracks
of Xixzyr.  No payment is necessary, as the demons are not under any form of
control.  Care is taken so that as soon as the void scholar completes the
normal ritual, he flees the scene before the creatures arrive.  
~
E
second~
The Winged Vershak

Seldom will the void scholar encounter a more elegant killer than the
Vershak.  Sleek, winged, and deadly, the Vershak is a denizen of Selb-Kar, a
place in the Void where space and time are mangled beyond all meaning.  

The vershak is first and foremost a killing thing.  Equipped and bred for
very little else, it will serve the scholar of void well as a demon to rend
and tear at the flesh of foes.  

Find the true form of the Angles of Selb-Kar, and inscribe it in bone dust. 
Recite the ritual of demon summoning, then present the Vershak with the
skull of a being of sufficient potency, and it will serve you well.  
~
E
third~
The Hound of Abuha:

The Hound of Abuha is an aberration, thinly cloaked in the form of a demonic
wolf.  Hairless and snarling, the hound stands about as tall as a small
pony.  It is unknown whether Abuha refers to this breed of hound or the
demon who first trained him, but in tradition that is the name with which
they are associated.  

The Hound is a beast of the hunt, and wise scholars conjure it to a location
where their foe has recently passed.  Once called forth, the hound can track
the victim, following the trail with the perfection of unnatural senses.  

To call it forth, inscribe the Scar of Gagaroth with a sprinkling of silver
powder.  The beast will need to be fed when summoned, so prepare the
entrails of a large enough animal to assuage its hunger.

A Fortress Residence~
A spacious room with log-constructed walls, this residence is designed to
house an entire family.  Utilitarian sleeping mats are folded in one corner
as the occupants go about their daily business.  The residence itself is
plain, the wooden walls bearing no decorations, and a simple set of
cupboards containing all basic housewares.  Although spartan, the room is
neatly kept and appears comfortable.

A Fortress Residence~
This large room with wooden walls evidently serves as a home to a large
family, as there are various belonging strewn everywhere.  A number of
sleeping pallets have been piled in a corner to provide space during the
daytime.  A small wooden table is piled with foodstuffs and cooking
utinsels.  Although cramped and cluttered, the residence is generally clean
and reasonably comfortable-looking.

The Forge~
A large room with wooden walls blackened from the smoke of the foundry to
the north, the forge is adorned with four black iron anvils of varying
sizes.  Pieces of iron stock rest in piles around the room, waiting to be
shaped into weapons, armor, and tools.  The heat in the forge is oppressive,
radiating from the furnace to the north, and the air is filled with scents
of smoke and sweat.

A large room with wooden walls blackened from smoke, the foundry is
dominated by a clay furnace set against the west wall.  It is here that the
ores produced by the mining community of Krilin are purified into workable
metals.  Iron troughs used to hold the molten ores lay about the foundry,
marked with enchanted runes to prevent melting.  Cinders float up from the
mouth of the furnace, and a withering heat floods the room.  A large brick
chimney ascends through the ceiling, carrying the smoke and heat upward.

The Alchemist\@s Chamber~
This rustic laboratory features a large open firepit along the western
wall.  A tin chimney hood captures only a portion of the smoke coming from
below the several sooty cauldrons suspended in a large iron framework. 
Glass bottles and stone jars, solid crates and small barrels, threadbare
bags and leather pouches--all are stacked, piled, and shelved haphazardly
throughout the room.  A long sturdy table, its surface tiled with stained
and chipped stone, dominates the center of the room.  At its foot, near the
firepit, is a metal water basin.  The only decoration in the room is a large
soot-stained tapestry that completely covers the southern wall.

Outside the Gates of Krilin Fortress~
A narrow road leads up to the fortress gates, two iron-bound portals of
wood that open directly into Krilin Fortress.  The bound-log walls rise
before you, and the faint sound of soldiers treading the battlements can be
heard.  To the south, the narrow road curves down a slope and leads into the
mountains.  East and west, a small trail leads around the fortress.

Approaching Krilin Fortress~
The narrow mountain road climbs the steady slope to the north toward the
solid walls of Krilin Fortress.  An imposing structure of tightly bound
logs, the sturdy walls of the fortress protect the inhabitants from raiding
hill giants.  The battlements along the top are lined with sharpened wooden
stakes, and Krilin soldiers march back and forth, watching for invaders. 
The front gates lie directly to the north.
