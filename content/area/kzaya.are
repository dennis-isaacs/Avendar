hippie borg black-clad black clad~
a borg~
A black-clad borg is here, looking hardcore.
~
This male borg is the epitome of eevil.  He wears a complex suit of
biomechanisms that look suspiciously like goth club wear, and his skin is an
unhealthy, pasty white color.  His left hand has been replaced by a cannon
of sorts, and his right is lined entirely with diodes.  His face is 1/4
covered with a large black device that circles his left eye, and spouts a
pipe that runs down his ear to his back.

charred nefortu hunched animalistic creature neffiregimp~
a charred, hunched nefortu~
A charred creature crawls around, loping with an animalistic gait.
~
This creature appears to have once been a nefortu, though its current
state is far from that.  Its ears have been sliced off near their tips,
while what remains is ragged and scrappy.  Its body is blackened with a
layer of dirt and soot that only barely covers the thick network of burn
scars that crisscross its body.  Its fingers have been torturously shaped
into wickedly sharp yet hollow claws, and only dangling strips of burnt
flesh remain where wings once were.  There is no trace of gender on this
being\@s body, yet its eyes burn with a terrible fire-fed hatred.

Wynliean~
A burning body, barely recognizable as a man, writhes here within a smoldering pentagram.
~
The tattered body of the man once known as Wynliean lies here, burning
with unnatural fire.  Scarcely more than a skeleton, the body is covered
almost completely with charred flesh, which, steaming and boiling beneath
the heat, radiates the pungent smell of burning flesh.  As you watch a coil
of white flame wraps about his arm, flaring as it alights a section of
healthy flesh, reducing it to char and ash.  Somewhere within the arm,
however, a bright light burns briefly, and with a spray of blood the flesh
restores itself to some grim semblance of health again, completing the
gristly cycle.  Wynliean alternately grins and grimaces through the pain as
the flames alternately destroy and renew what is left of his body.

mpechoat $n It seems as though you float in the darkness, surrounded by a deathly,
mpechoat $n stagnant chill which gnaws at your flesh.  You quickly realise that the void
mpechoat $n is not complete.  Great filaments of material stretch across the bleak
mpechoat $n distance, jagged detritus bound to vast tendrils of flowing energy.  The
mpechoat $n filaments converge on a single point of focus - a redly-pulsing glow some
mpechoat $n great distance below you, inasmuch as such directions have meaning here.  
mpechoat $n 
mpechoat $n Before you, the red glow begins to take form, as though the vast distances
mpechoat $n separating you from it had evaporated in an instant.  You hang, immobile,
mpechoat $n far above an immense city - or so you assume it to be, although it resembles
mpechoat $n no other city in existence.  It is formed entirely of monumental spires of
mpechoat $n volcanic glass, which bristle upward in their thousands from a vast mass of
mpechoat $n viscous magma and burning black slag.  The lower parts of the great spires
mpechoat $n are, particularly towards the rim of the city, heated to a molten glow,
mpechoat $n while their upper reaches vary in texture from twisting bundles of glassy
mpechoat $n fibre to thick, reflective slabs of rock.  
mpechoat $n
mpechoat $n Each and every tower in the city seems to be riddled with tunnels, as well
mpechoat $n as forming the foundation for hundreds of iron structures.  These
mpechoat $n ubiquitous, ugly extentions cling squatly against the glassy surfaces or
mpechoat $n rise like sharp, metallic fangs into the void above.  Rust-coloured iron
mpechoat $n bridges connect adjacent spires, or in some places leap high above the
mpechoat $n surface of the city in precarious highways.  And across these highways, and
mpechoat $n in the vapid air between the spires, and, indeed, everywhere you look, roam
mpechoat $n the miriad denizens of the city, the thousand breeds of demonkind who are
mpechoat $n the citizens of the void city Logor.  
mpechoat $n 
mpechoat $n The entire city seems to be in a state of violent, dynamic flux.  As you
mpechoat $n watch, a spire near the rim quakes and then topples, shattering several of
mpechoat $n its neighbours as it collapses into the magma.  Iron bridges twist and snap,
mpechoat $n hurling hundreds, perhaps thousands of demons into the ruin.  Fragments
mpechoat $n topple from the rim, joining the ragged streamers which stretch off into the
mpechoat $n void.  You see now that the lava spilling downward from the ruin joins a
mpechoat $n long stream of many tendrils which trails off from the base of the city.  It
mpechoat $n is with some disconcertion that you realise that the bulk of these tendrils
mpechoat $n are not formed by similar spillages of lava, but are of a fleshy, organic
mpechoat $n nature, bearing a resemblance to the poisonous filaments of some monstrous
mpechoat $n jellyfish, or to the ravaged, trailing guts of a disemboweled beast.  
mpechoat $n
mpechoat $n Your view shifts to focus on a flicker of movement within the magma beneath
mpechoat $n the city.  Looking closer you can make out the white-hot form of some
mpechoat $n gigantic serpent as it swims through the intense heat.  The serpent suddenly
mpechoat $n stops within the magma, turning in your direction.  Seemingly sensing your
mpechoat $n presence it bursts forth from within Logor\@s surface, its fiery form of pure
mpechoat $n heat rushing toward you in a spray of lava!  In the moments before what you
mpechoat $n perceive to be your demise you are struck with the unmistakable sense of
mpechoat $n intense hatred. 
mpechoat $n 
mpechoat $n Your vision returns to normal, and you find yourself within the chamber once more.

a handmaiden of Tzakmeqiel~
A handmaiden of Tzakmeqiel the Desecrator burbles to herself.
~
This handmaiden of Tzakmeqiel is mostly a lump of bloated flesh.  She
moves by propelling her lower, blob-like body along a trail of slick mucus,
while the vestigates of a head and torso are supported by the mounds of fat.
A nauseating reek bubbles up from her depths, following the pulsing and
roiling of distended tissue.  

More horribly, the handmaiden\@s skin is obviously diseased, and, in some
cases, putrefying.  Boils crisscross her face and neck, while plague sores
are omnipresent.  Oozing, never healing wounds open and close in time with
her burbling motion, and the handmaiden\@s eyes are a jaundiced yellow.  The
demon speaks rarely, pausing to wretch up the contents of her stomach
between belching forth curses and insults at nothing in particular.

intelligent eyes of a warm brown sparkle with observant energy, flanking a
strong nose.  A broad-lipped mouth is nestled in a long, magnificent beard
of white, curly hair which reaches nearly to his waist.  The crown of the
caladaran\@s head is shaved clean but for a small lock of hair, bound into a
topknot.  Long, wiry limbs and slender fingers add to the caladaran\@s
already decidedly scholary air.  A simple, faded robe of neutral grey-brown
adorns the priest\@s shoulders, and a glowing hourglass sigil marks him as a
devotee of the god Chadraln.

j\@nakra ethereal minordemon minorbound demon imp imp-like form~
an ethereal j\@nakra~
An imp-like form seems to shimmer in and out of existence before you.
~
The thing before you is vaguely reminicent of an imp, albeit one larger
than its brethren.  The flesh of the j\@nakra is a sickly white hue, its
paleness implaceably unwholesome.  The limbs of the beast end in sets of
piercing and rending claws while its pinched, impish face sports a grinning
mouth of jagged bone spurs.  A pair of rapidly flapping wings support the
creature, the membranes of its bat-like members a strikingly unreflective
black.  Discerning these features is made all the more difficult by the
j\@nakra\@s only semi-visible nature.  

The j\@nakra never is fully visible, pieces of its body always seeming to
fade into the air.  Even as the limbs shimmer back into existance, others
fade creating an unsettling picture of semi-intagibility.  The beating of
its wings and the tittering of its deadly mouth suddenly cease on occasion
as the sources of the sound disappear, the ensuing quiet soon shattered as
its flesh continues its dance through the ether.

a chain-draped Nvae\@gra~
A gaunt, chain-shrouded figure stalks about.
~
Lengths of blackened and tarnished chain obscure, for the most part, the
gaunt figure of the Nvae\@gra.  Midnight-blue flesh is pulled over an inhuman
skeleton, drawn so tight that spurs of bone edge through.  The chains, links
serrated and cruelly barbed, draped over the demon\@s form give forth an
unsettling clatter as they swing dangerously about, running over and through
the Nvae\@gra\@s flesh, and drag along the ground.  

Beneath the shroud of iron, twin points of glowing red smoulder in the
sockets of a skull only partially covered by flesh.  Dark skin has peeled
away from the face of this creature, clinging to the lower jaw tautly,
attempting to hold fast to its last, razor-toothed purchase.

Imbued with a magical rune of cooling from the water scholars of Krilin,
this helm was made to be an aid to a travelling army of Krilin soldiers who
set out to quash the menace of a large conclave of followers of Bayyal in

resistance in the form of droves of nefortean fire scholars and templars. 
The soldiers perished quickly, yet the bloodlust of the followers of the God
of Hate was yet unquenched, so they turned on each other.  Once the dust of
battle cleared, few of the remaining \#victors\# from the battle with the
Krilin soldiers remained.  They returned to the vast network of tunnels
within the walls of the Canyon and became highly reclusive, each trying
to prove themselves more worthy than the others in the eyes of their God.

a pair of heavy granite gloves~
A pair of heavy granite gloves studded with chips of stone lie here.~
These gloves were created by a master earth scholar who was taken into
bondage by a group of bandits in the Savannah.  After holding him for a few
weeks and demanding that he make a weapon \#worthy of them,\# the scholar
finally conceded and set to work on creating these gloves.  The bandits felt
triumphant, and let the scholar go.  Unfortunately for them, a lone nefortu
earth templar wandered up just as the scholar fled.  Fascinated by the
gloves, he demanded to see them.  When the bandits told him where to shove
his request, he made quick work of the crew with a swarm of meteors. 
Plucking the gloves from the corpse of the bandits\@ leader, the templar
returned home to Kzaya Ha Canyon, the frightened scholar far from his
thoughts.

A set of blades lie here, glowing a dull red.~
These blades were forged by a particularly powerful fire templar of Kzaya
Ha Canyon named Lidjaza out of the remains of the armours and weapons of his
fallen enemies.  Created especially to fit the wings of a nefortu, and
imbued by Lidjaza with a measure of fiery magic that repels those of lawful
intent, these wing-blades were used by him as an additional pair of weapons.
Lidjaza himself ultimately removed his own wings and replaced them with
magical wings of flame, but kept his creations as a reminder of his own
power and skill in battle.

golden bracer melted charred slightly scorched~
a slightly scorched golden bracer~
A golden bracer, its edges slightly scorched, lies here.~
This bracer was once worn by Lieutenant Juvha of the Kor Thrandirian
military on an expedition to Ashta Harrud.  On the way, the Lieutenant\@s
forces were jumped by a raiding party of bandits within the Savannah, and
the overly vain officer was slain.  The bandits then took their booty to a
hidden encampment where, unbeknownst to them, a group of nefortu thieves
from the nearby canyon had begun pillaging their stash.  The thieves snuck
out before being detected and easily slid their daggers into the backs of
the battle-weary bandits as they returned to their camp.  Pleased with their
stash, the thieves snuck back home and held a raucous celebration, in which
they lit up the canyon with flame and danced victoriously.  

Their celebration dance did not go unnoticed, however, by the denizens of
the tunnels within the canyon.  Inside the tunnels, the templar Lidjaza
became furious at the noisemaking, and set out to put a halt to their party.
Harnessing the power of the small fire that they had lit by which they
celebrated, Lidjaza easily bowled the group over, setting thief after thief
aflame.  The final living partygoer-- the same one who held this bracer--
quivered in a corner as Lidjaza approached, his eyes alight with flame. 
With a huge blast of novic flame, Lidjaza scorched the whimpering thief
straight through, burning the bracer as well.  Despite the fact that it was
melted slightly, Lidjaza took it and placed it within a secret hiding
compartment, since he had no immediate use for it himself.

A small brown dress lies here.~
This dress was created by a tailor in Eril especially for an adorable
little girl named Leeluq.  She wore it often and deemed it her favourite
piece of clothing.  She wore it on her first \#date\# with a boy named Eqeru,
in which they roamed the savannah by night.  Unfortunately for them, they
were attacked and Eqeru was taken hostage.  Leeluq searched for adventurers
who would aid her in releasing him, since she was not skilled in the arts of
combat herself.

A thin dagger, its edge heavily worn, lies here.~
This dagger was once held by an intrepid-- if stupid-- young adventurer. 
At the fragile age of ten, he set out on a journey to Ashta Harrud, visions
of freeing slaves in his mind.  The road that he was on was the incorrect
one, however, and instead of Harrud, he ended up in Kzaya Ha Canyon.  He was
jumped by a band of roguish nefortu and slain easily.  The dagger was taken
from his still-warm corpse and used by the nefortu for quite some time.

These gloves were once worn by a young adventurer from Var Bandor who

way south, through the savannah, he came upon a canyon and allowed his
curiousity to take hold.  As he descended into the canyon, he slipped on the
path and fell down, landing painfully on the rocks below.  He was barely
conscious as a nefortu thug descended upon him and took his things and was
ultimately left for dead.  The nefortu thug who took his things wore the
gloves for years thereafter, wearing them down at the fingertips.

a long, sharp silver glaive~
A long glaive lies here, its tip a sinister-sharp silver point.~
After many reported robberies, thefts, and arsons that were allegedly
perpetuated by a group of nefortu from Kzaya Ha Canyon, the Patrician of
Earendam called that a group of his most elite soldiers head to the depths
of the canyon and put an end to the travelling band of mercenaries.  This
was easily accomplished, since the mercenaries were far less skilled than
were the soldiers who hunted them, but once the soldiers had cleared the
canyon of its guilty parties, they turned their eyes upon a mysterious
tunnel that was set in the wall of the Canyon.  Curious, they headed into
it, hoping that they might find a stash of gold and wealth.  Instead,
however, they met with a number of powerful nefortu masters of flame.  The
soldiers fought valiantly to get to the end of the cave, where a number of
the nefortu that they had hunted had begged to show them a wealth of goods. 
Instead of finding this, they came upon a very angry earth templar.  After
their armour had been weakened by the fire scholars and templars, the
templar-- a large nefortu named Vaakam-- crushed their weakened armour
easily and drove most of the soldiers to flee.  A few unfortunates remained,
however, and one of the dead had held this glaive which Vaakam took as a
prize.

A thick woolen cape lies here.~
This cape was made by a master cloakmaker from Earendam from wool grown
by the Lsakia tribe that was gathered by one of his underlings on an
excursion to Ashta Harrud.  It was created for a wealthy traveller, who
wanted something light yet warm while on an excursion to the barren north of
the plains of Ryarl.  Unfortunately, the map to Ryarl was sold to the
wealthy adventurer from the shop of a crooked businessman and led him south
rather than north, to a barren place called Kzaya Ha Canyon.  He only
finally realized that his path had led him astray by the time that a group
of four nefortu thieves had snuck up on him and plunged a dagger into his
back.  The cloak was taken by one of the thieves and remained on her back
until it was taken from her by a group of wandering adventurers.

A pair of leather sandals lie here.~
Made by an journeyman cobbler in Var Bandor, these sandals were created
for comfort rather than looks.  Their soles were crafted with intense
precision, but the leather that was left for their upper part was only
scrap, hence their ragged design.  They were sold to a young templar who set
off to explore Avendar and unwittingly stumbled across Kzaya Ha Canyon. 
Unaware of the myriad of warnings and angry animals set about the entrance
to the tunnels, the templar-- who just happened to be ethron, and thusly
light on his feet-- slipped into the tunnels of Kzaya Ha Canyon, but was
brought to a fiery early grave by a fireball set off by a young nefortu fire
scholar.  

The scholar was unaware of his visitor until he heard the ethron\@s death
cry, and took the sandals from the freshly dead corpse as a prize.

the Spear of the Anointed General~
A well balanced shaft of aged wood lies here, emmitting a low resounding hum.~
The spear is a symbol of the Ethron Sect of the Council of Anointed,
passed down from one Lord High General to another, since the founding of the
hall directly after the war of Night.  It bears both a symbolic and militant
grace to the Anointed, in that it shows the leadership entrusted to the Lord
High General, and can be easily seen while in battle for his troops to
rally.

A Small Riverbed~
Sinking down over three feet below the surface of the ground around it,
this dried riverbed appears to have once been the home of a babbling brook. 
The ground itself is a mixture of sand and dried mud and is dotted with a
few small stones, many of which appear to have been smoothed by moving
water.  The wall of the canyon rises abruptly to the west, blocking passage
and casting this area in a small amount of shade.  Up a small rise of eroded
sandy dirt to the east lies the floor of the canyon, and the dried streambed
continues to the north and south.  The sky is open above you.

The End of A Small Riverbed~
What appears to have once been a streambed begins here.  The only
remaining evidence of the stream itself is a slight depression in the
surface of the sand and dirt, and a number of erosion-rounded stones tossed
in amongst the chaff from the walls of the canyon.  A large fissure with
rounded edges in the eastern wall of the canyon is stained with white salty
deposits, marking it as the one time source of water for this stream.  The
dust and grit within the wall of the canyon show that this spring has not
been active for ages.  The streambed deepens to the north, while the ground
evens out to the east and south.

The sandy dirt floor of the canyon is littered with a layer of rock chips

rocks that make up the body of the canyon are a pale sandy colour and show
many layers of different sand tones.  The stone near the bottom, and that
which is found here, is a deep ochre.  Sandy dirt heads off south and

A Small Alcove~
Three walls converge here, to create a narrow, claustrophobic alcove. 
The walls are covered with carved-in graffiti that crudely depicts
victorious nefortu devouring the remains of various human and aelin figures.
The ground is covered with a thick layer of dried grasses in which a number
of blood splatters have dried, giving them a speckled appearance.  The open
cave continues to the west, where the body of the canyon can be seen.

The Entrance to a Tunnel~
Set back a few feet from the edge of the canyon, this entryway appears to
have been carved for some grandiose purpose.  Nearly twenty feet in
diameter, the entryway is impressively large and imposing, despite the
obviously less-than-artisan quality of its carving.  A bust and wings of a
nefortu have been cruedly carved in the rock to give the impression of
emerging from the wall.  Its face is contorted into one of rage, and it
angles a spear downward at the center of the entryway.  Phrases are carved
along the edge of the entryway, in nefortu on the left and in common on the
right.  A ledge leads out to the body of the canyon to the west.

ceiling slanting downward at a sharp angle.  The upper four feet of the
walls have been polished to a smooth finish and reflect any shown light
easily.  The bottom six, however, are made of a rough, porous stone that
appears to have absolutely no shine to it.  The tunnel itself seems to be
soaked up by this rock, and it is at a large concentration of it that the
tunnel ends.  The smoothly polished walls of the tunnel continue to the
south.

An Intersection of Two Small Tunnels~
Two tunnels cross each other here, heading off in different directions. 
Each tunnel has been hollowed from the solid rock of the canyon\@s walls by
eons of erosion, which have given the tunnels a very smooth, slick look.  To
the south, the tunnel ends abruptly and heads off to the west, where streaks
of black mar the otherwise brown walls.  The tunnel continues as it is here
to the north and east.

A Narrow Side Tunnel~
Barely more than a wide crack in the rock, this narrow side tunnel arcs
southward, away from the western intersection.  Its walls and arched ceiling
are made of a dark brown stone that has been streaked in many colored
layers.  Each wall is no more than four feet from the other, making movement
here rather difficult for all but the smallest of travelers.  Few footprints
are visible on the dusty ground, probably due to the size of the tunnel.

A Dead-End~
A narrow tunnel comes to an end here.  The dark brown rock walls,
ceiling, and floor all slowly converge at the southern end of the tunnel,
eventually becoming a flat wall.  A small, ancient crack is visible in the
ceiling, its edges worn away to a smooth surface.  The tunnel itself seems
to emerge from this point, its walls worn smooth by years of attritional
erosion.  The only exit from here is to the west, where the tunnel arcs
toward the north.

A Sharply Turning Tunnel~
The tunnel twists sharply to the north and west here, the convergence of
paths forming a sharp, twenty degree angle.  The temperature of the black
air is around ninety degrees and feels as if it hasn\@t been moved in eons. 
Toward the west, the rock walls become jagged and sharp and begin to narrow,
their sharp points streaked with blackness.  Northward is a more typical
tunnel, lined with stalactites, stalagmites, and smoothly-eroded brown stone
walls and ceiling.

A Straight, Narrowing Tunnel~
The dark brown granite walls of this tunnel are nearly covered by a thick
black pitch.  Jagged and rough to the touch, the circular tube of pathway is
oddly angry, each rock angling out violently from the ones around it.  Since
the tunnel is only six feet wide at its largest point, the jagged rock gives
it an aura of menace.  Heat emanates from the south, keeping the black air
here well over ninety degrees.  The tunnel continues like this to the north,
and becomes far warmer to the south.

and oppressive, and rests at a temperature of around ninety degrees

This narrow tunnel of blackened stone twists sharply, heading generally
toward the south and west.  The temperature here is just over one hundred
degrees, and seems to grow even more hot to the south.  A line of carved
text circles a small entryway into a hot, dark cavern to the south.  Each
character of the phrase glows a sinister red, illuminating this room with a
sickly, hellish light.  The entryway to the south looks to have been hewn
roughly from the rock around it and appears to only be wide enough to fit
one adventurer at a time.  The tunnel continues to the west, where the air
is noticably cooler.

The Entry to an Ancient Cavern~
A wide chamber opens here, becoming spacious and dark toward the south
and west.  The walls are speckled with splashes of blood and a number of
violently-carved engravings done in an ancient text.  Each rune-like letter
of the engravings has been rubbed over with black, whose combination with
the dried splatterings of long gone adventurers give the room a sinister
air.  The atmosphere in here is stifling, for the heavy darkness gives the
room a claustrophobic feel while intense, scorching heat emanates from the
walls themselves.  The cavern narrows and is surrounded by a line of glowing

This, the southeast corner of the cavern, is filled with a pile of

blackened with scorch marks and rends that appear to have been done with
teeth or claws.  Above the pile is an inscription, done in a violent script
that resembles a combination of modern nefortu and ancient runic writing
that appears to have been carved quickly.  Each letter glows with an ominous
inner light, dimly illuminating the stiflingly hot chamber.  A large pillar

Before a Great Pillar of Flame~
This corner of the cavern is dominated by a pillar of flame that courses
from floor to ceiling.  Composed of glowing red flames that dance an
endlessly intricate yet deadly waltz up and down the height of the cave, it
sets the room alive, bathing everything in an eerie red glow.  The pillar
itself is ringed with two large steel rings, both of which are nearly five
feet in diameter.  Upon the rings are inscribed lines of runic writing,
their edges sharp despite their proximity to the flame.  A phrase in
recognizable writing is set in the lower ring, offering a simultaneous
warning and challenge.  Other than this pillar, the cave here is
comparatively unremarkable.  It continues to the north, where a large hole
is set in the ground, and to the east, where a pile of bones and gristle are
piled against the wall.

brown rock faces stoically reaching toward the sky.  To the south, the body
of the canyon opens wide, leading to a rock-spotted field of sand.  A steep

in spotty sores.  Several of the wounds ooze some form of fluid, the

covered in a greenish, crusted scab.  Along the sides of the scab is a line
of fresh pus, which lends a thick smell of sickness to the air here.  A few
of the pale grasses have become entangled in the sore, some of which appear
to be partially knitted into the surface of its scab.  Around each blade of

Where the pus-covered skin fails, a veritable sea of miasma of greenish ,
whitish, and black tones extends outward, as far as the eye can see. 
Occaisional stirrings within the plagued ooze incur a bulging and bursting
of some of the bubble-like sacs that float across the vast expanse of
fluids, which leaves a strong scent of sickness hanging in the air.  The
moraine heads downward to the east, where a single large sore has formed

The few grasses that grow from the fleshy ground here fall off completely

in diameter, the pustules appear to be each in a different stage of
maturity.  Some are a deep red colour, lined with several veins.  Others are
purplish-black, their uneven tone belying the overextended nature of the
flesh above them.  Others have ruptured, and spilled a reddish orange pus
over the nearby pustules.  Their growth here is so prolific that travel in
any direction but south is impossible.

A Slippery, Pus-Covered Slope~
The ground angles steeply downward from east to west, creating a sharply
angled slope.  The sparse grasses along the ground are all angled toward the
west, their direction forced by the thick layer of pus that slowly slides
down the slope.  The air is thick with the smell of diseased decay, which
hangs stalidly in the vicinity.  To the east, a large scab forms something
of a landing, and appears to be the source of the pus that covers the
ground.  Westward, the pus forms something of a pool, as the ground again
levels out.

Around a Pool of Pus~
The sloped ground to the east evens out here, providing a wide, flat
surface.  The pus from the slope to the east forms a wide pool of seething,
whitish muck.  The stench of disease and decay is very strong, and seems to
be mostly emanating from the pool.  The fleshy ground here is streaked with
lines of red and purple veins, all of which seem to be centered upon the
pool.  Eastward, the ground angles upward to a large moraine.  All other
directions are made impassible by the ending of the fleshy land, which fades
off into the blackness of the void which extends far further than the eye
can see.

A Collapsed Tunnel~
This small tunnel through the stone is cramped and confined, completely
blocked to the east.  Apparently natural in origin, the tunnel has been
widened and made more smooth.  A cunningly concealed hatch above leads up
into another chamber in the stone.  The cave-in appears intentional, deep
gouges and scars as if from pickaxes and crowbars biting into the walls. 
The tunnel walls are scored with dozens of small runes, each highlighted
with faintly luminescent blue paint.  The runes all seem to be of spirit-
and water-magics, though they are obscure enough that it is impossible to be
certain.

An Old Tunnel~
This small tunnel through the stone is cramped and confined, the air
thick with the smells of brimstone and smoke.  Apparently natural in origin,
the tunnel has been widened and made more smooth.  The tunnel wends its way
to the east and west.  Yellowish, greasy light pours into the tunnel from
the east, and the walls of the tunnel are worn smooth by years amd years of
passage.  An ominous sense of something else fills the tunnel, a malicious
willpower surrounding you.

A Round Alcove~
A winding tunnel through the earth opens out into a naturally-occurring
alcove here, a spherical cave in the crumbly, striated brown stone.  Small
tunnels through the earth wend their way west and south, apparently widened
and made smooth by mortal hands.  The air is filled with a light haze of
smoke and the rotten-eggs stink of brimstone.  A fine wrought-iron torch
sconce has been driven into the soft stone, the brand within filling the
room with flickering, yellowish light.

A Smoky Tunnel~
This small tunnel through the stone is cramped and confined, the air
thick with the smells of brimstone and smoke.  Apparently natural in origin,
the tunnel has been widened and made more smooth.  The tunnel wends its way
to the north and south.  Yellowish, greasy light pours into the tunnel from
the east, and the walls of the tunnel are worn smooth by years amd years of
passage.  An ominous sense of something else fills the tunnel, a malicious
willpower surrounding you.

A Cold, Stone-Walled Chamber~
This circular chamber is walled in with cold, dank, gray stones.  Along
the floor and ceiling have been carved a number of runes, some instantly
recognizable as those of the void, others apparently alien and certainly
malevolent.  Each rune pulses blackly periodically in no discernible rhythm,
giving the air a sense of crackling energy.  At the center of two pentagrams
of binding are set chains and handcuffs of heavy steel.  A third pentagram
sprawls out in the center of the floor.

A Tall Spire, High Above the City of Logor~
A red glow emanates from everwhere and nowhere atop this spire, which
seems to be but one of many such hole-riddled edifices in the general
vicinity.  The spires bristle upward in their thousands from a vast mass of
viscous magma and burning black slag.  The lower parts of the great spires
are, particularly towards the rim of the city, heated to a molten glow,
while their upper reaches vary in texture from twisting bundles of glassy
fibre to thick, reflective slabs of rock.  Rust-coloured iron bridges
connect adjacent spires, or in some places leap high above the surface of
the city in precarious highways.  The myriad denizens of the city, the
thousand breeds of demonkind who are the citizens of the void city Logor,
travel across these bridges and through the spires, their actions masked by
distance.  

The immediate vicinity appears to be more structured than the others.  In
the surface of the volcanic glass is a pentagram, perfectly formed and
flawless.  Each line of the pentagram extends deeply into the surface of the
glass, and each bit flows into the others endlessly.

At A Fleshy Throne~
A long trail of irregular stairs leads up to a throne of flesh and
pulsing organs in this yawning chamber that appears to be made of the same. 
Bodies writhe with one another, twisting and turning in expressions of
passion -- whether it is the passion of pleasure or pain is difficult to
tell.
