Eadin~
Eadin Ilroya, Keeper of the Library, stands her watch here.
~
A whip-slender aelin, Eadin is a pale, blond woman with steely grey eyes.
Strong and slim, she stands with a resolute self-discipline, eyes surveying
the foyer of her beloved Library for possible trouble.  Roughly five feet in
height, she moves with amazing speed, even for an aelin, and seems a quite
capable person for the job of the head Keeper of the Library.

a burly, liveried gladiator~
A burly, liveried gladiator peers about protectively.
~
This burly ethron gladiator\@s dark green skin is crisscrossed with a
network of paler scars earned through a life of battle.  Straw-colored hair
is shorn close to the scalp, bristly and stiff, as is his scraggly beard. 
Light brown eyes move with the wariness of a hunter, suspicious and alert. 
His entirely body is muscled and conditioned, his stance speaking of natural
readiness.  Broad and stout, is is slightly taller than five feet in height,
but over half again as wide.

a musclebound guard~
A musclebound guard stands here, alert and wary.
~
This bruiser of a man is well over six feet tall.  A shaved head is
tattooed with the sigil of the Hourglass behind his left ear, though judging
by his scars and broken, crooked nose, he has not spent his life in quiet
observation and study.  Deep emerald eyes have a crafty, evaluatory gleam to
them, a bristling walrus mustache of pale brown blossoming underneath his
mangled nose.

a caladaran monk~
A caladaran monk clad in the simple robes of the Chadralnite Order stands here.
~
This slender caladaran\@s skin is the rough, irregular texture of an
ancient oak, a deep pumpkernickel brown.  His head is hairless, though his
large, placid grey eyes sit beneath bushy, prominent eyebrows of faded, pale
green.  A hooklike nose sits over a thin mouth.  A scholarly air wraps the
monk with quiet dignity, his gaze serene and observant.

an ethron monk~
An ethron monk clad in the simple robes of the Chadralnite Order stands here.
~
A stocky, short ethron, this monk has a quiet, reserved air about him. 
His deep green skin is traced with a network of fine lines, the only sign of
his age.  His pine-green hair is shaved in a tonsure of humility, though his
dark eyes seem quick and intelligent.  A quill is stuck absentmindedly
behind one ear, an ink-stain on his temple revealing that this is not an
uncommon practice of his.  Equally stained fingers speak of many hours spent
over an inkwell, the nails darkened with the substance.  A sigil glows on
his upper arm, through his garments.

An ancient, wizened human monk oversees the Scriptorium.
~
This hunched old monk is well into his advanced years.  Bright, sharp
eyes peer out of a face which is not so much wrinkled as -made- of wrinkles.
His dark, dark brown skin is lined with the years, and he is completely bald
but for two wisps of bone-white hair over each ear.  Toothless gums and thin
lips are pursed in nearly perpetual disapproval, and he watches over his
charges with a stern, unforgiving eye.  His gnarled old hands are like
crows\@ talons, gripping at a quill with the careless practice of long use.

This simple study is panelled in simple pine.  A wide, curving desk of
the same wood dominates the small, cell-like room.  The eastern wall is
covered completely by bookshelves.  A brass lamp on the desk is mounted with
a frosted crystal globe, illuminating the room with bright-yellow light. 
The ceiling is glossy plaster, painted with a simple chart of Avendar\@s
moons and some of the more commonly-known stars.  A wooden door leads west,
fitted with an ancient brass latch-lift.
  
The center bookshelf has swung outward, revealing a passage to the east.

a shuddeni psionicist~
A shuddeni hovers here, clad in the robes of a psionicist.
~
This gaunt shuddeni\@s skin is a dusky grey, her form vaguely feminine in
its build.  A round, egglike head is hairless, the parchmenty scalp covered
with the same network of fine wrinkles which covers her slightly-baggy skin.
A sardonic smirk seems permanently encamped upon her withered face.  The
dimpled depressions which replace her eyes have an unsettling intensity to
them, her gaze frigid as ice and tenacious as iron.

Skin tinged with an eerie blue luminescence, this male seraph hovers here

pupils, his nose, a small and perfect one, is perpetually flared wide as if
in anger, and his large mouth is set hard.  Statuesque, his enormous and
expansive wings, whose shadows seem to swallow up the surroundings,

In\@vesi the Seraph-General, hovers here. 
~
Squat and wide, this male seraph hovers on two slender wings of light. 
Barrel-chested, short but extremely thick arms and legs lend stockiness to
his frame.  His skin, definitely a peculiar feature, is translucent and
encrusted with luminescent jagged glass.  His head, in no way spherical and
lacking hair, sprouts instead a multitude of mini crystal formations.  His
eyes are golden and without pupils, his thick lips are peaked and cracked
with tiny bits of glass, and a nose split with infinitesimal peaks sprawls
across his face.

Diminutive and golden-skinned, this male seraph hovers here on two wings

small between a slender nose and a short chin, and both cheeks are etched
with a single deep, long line which, at one time, might have been a dimple. 
A tonsure of short peppery hair rings his head, exposing a sheened golden
pate.

accentuate silver eyes without pupils.  Golden tousled locks of hair spill
and curl about his shoulders, and a small and sleek, perfectly formed nose
sits above a sensuous mouth framed by a thin, well-groomed mustache and
beard.  His wings, translucent and shot through with a silver-veined

Ealaira, the Protector of the Ecclesiarch, flies here tranquilly. 
~
Devoid of hair and eyebrows, this bronze-hued seraph is enshrouded with a
golden carapace of liquid ch\@lonin.  Her smooth pate is well formed and
perfectly round, her eyes are without pupils and shimmer golden, and her
jaws are formed with sharply defined right angles.  A slender fluted neck;
pert nose, small ears and full lips accentuate her femininity despite being
hairless.  Statuesque and sleekly muscled, her arms and legs lend length to
her frame.  Her golden carapace, seemingly some sort of viscous yet
constantly flowing exo-film, occasionally forms thin, threadlike ch\@lonin
filaments, which probe her surroundings with autonomous curiosity.

Chel\@latar, the Mother of the Two Dawns~
A lovely, pregnant seraph radiates diffused light from her bulging belly. 
~
Young, beautiful and pregnant, this golden-hued seraph radiates diffused
light from her swollen stomach.  Tall and slender (save for her bulging
belly), her bare, well-toned but sleek arms do not reflect her expectant
condition.  Her curly hair shimmers gold and falls to her shoulders, and her
sharply defined jaws frame an upturned nose, rounded chin and thinly
chiseled lips.  Her frame is elegantly draped with a sleeveless, ankle
length diaphanous light-woven dress, beneath which her stomach swells visibly. 
Her entire body seems to be lit from within, and the source of light seems
to be her unborn children, two small, slowly pulsating orbs of golden light.

Tall, golden-shimmered and sleekly muscled, Cheloweven hovers here on six
wings.  Her flaxen hair glints subtly, is cropped short, and curls about her
curved forehead, the top of her ears and the nape of her neck.  Statuesque
but slender, her exposed arms and legs are well toned.  Her wings,
translucent and veined with a copper-sheened luminescence, are divided into
three different pairs: the pair emerging from her shoulder blades have a
two-foot wingspan, the pair unfurled from her ribs have a twelve-foot
wingspan, and the pair spread from her waist have a five-foot wingspan.

Dearest Paelosa,

I am gladdened that you have so taken to your studies in Yithoul.  I\@ve
never been, as you know, but I heard such awful things and am delighted to
hear them untrue.  You know how Glidra talks, even of things she doesn\@t
know.  Anyway, I did as you asked and found that book for you.  They
wouldn\@t let me take it out of the library, so I just copied down what it
said.  Are you sure this will be useful?  It seemed very old to me, a musty,
tattered thing.  Well, this is what was written: 

{WFlamecall{x

First a flame of pure white, that a door may open bright.  Next the ear of
creature fey, to hear the call o\@er sounds of day.  Last the name of the
intended, writ on parchment never wended.  Then to you it will transpire,
the beating heart through burning fire.  

Really, Paelosa, this all seems quite mysterious to me!  I hope it makes
more sense to you.  Just be careful in that place, with all those strange
eyeless men.  Oh, goodness me, I almost forgot!  There was another note in
the book.  I don\@t know if you care, but it was written in such a neat hand
I couldn\@t help but copy it down.  It said: \#Fail.  Unl.  Near open flame. 
Other dir.  Is sulphur, boots, and copper coins, as with cin.  Scry. 
Tanar\@s man took the scroll.\#  Really just more gibberish, but the writing
was oh so impressive!  Really I wish you could have seen it, Paelosa.  

I\@ve also enclosed 10 pieces of gold for you to [this sentence has been
scratched over, making the first part hard to read and the rest illegible. 
Next to the scratches is stamped in red ink: \#Seized by his lordship\@s
secret service, 17th Nel.\#  Next to the stamp is written: \#No coins were
found with this note.\#  ]

a sizzling crystal staff~
A crystal staff with a core of steel sizzles with electrical energy.~
This is the staff of the terrible Lord Radoch, one of the court of
Gogoth.  A figure of legendary cruelty even before his transformation into a
lich at the hands of the Mad King, Radoch was an air scholar of a
particularly vicious bent.  Notorious especially for his torture chambers
revolving about the use of electricity as a pain-inducing element, Radoch
would regularly hunt for young women upon which to practice his sadistic
art.

This staff is rumored to have been the only thing left when the Champion
general Chadim struck him with a soulblade so powerful that it destroyed his
very essence in an instant.  This story is the subject of much debate, due
to the sensational nature of tales regarding the House powers.  Regardless,
the staff was eventually recovered by the aelin family of Keepers of the
Grand Library of Earendam through their political influences, and it has
been passed from generation to generation as a testament to such power.

Hello, my name is Klyistern.  I spoke to Pfusch\@s spirit just after she
passed.  She told me to write this here, and seemed very urgent in her tone.
I\@m doing it at her behest, and at her dictation, much as her style may be
annoying.  

\#It\@s not Xor!  Xor never was!  Xor was always me!  Xor and I were always

was me being a guide to myself, he was my own way of figuring out what I was
getting out of life.  I\@m so happy, I feel like I\@m whole again.  

Those of you who read this, consider that you may have a Xor of your own,
something you cling to when you need strength.  Whatever that is, and no
matter if it\@s taken from you, it\@s always within you somewhere.  Never
forget this, since your inner strength is what will get you through the

CHAPTER FOUR :: Xor\@s Return

One day, I was sitting in the Tower and puttering around, when a familiar
blue light flashed and I saw Lord Jolinn again!  He said \#I have something I
think you;need,\# and handed Xor back to me!  I was so happy and so thankful
and so honored that he thought of Xor enough to get him back from beyond the
edge of life for me!  After that, Xor and I would still talk, and he seemed
pleased that I had newfound strength within me, but I don\@t know what he
thought of it really.  

Slowly, he stopped talking to me as much.  He stopped moving and shaking and
being a part of my life.  I kept a picture of him drawn on my armor even
though we were together again, but things started changing as I got older. 
Xor and I were still great friends, but since he was so distant, we didn\@t
talk so much.  

I still feel stronger when we were together, though.  There\@s no changing
that.  Ever.

I met lots of really good friends in Aramril, including my very bestest
girl-friend Malusmi.  She and I got along even better than Artzt and I did. 
She liked Xor, too, which was a refreshing surprise.  Most people thought he
was silly.  We had a lot of good times, but we had a number of bad times
too.  

The Shunned was really powerful when it was just Malusmi and I in the Tower.
They did all sorts of bad things to people, including us.  We fought back as
much as we could, and I killed a couple of them a couple times, but for the
most part, we were on the losing end.  Eventually, Malusmi was named the
leader of the Champions AND recognized as a follower of Jolinn, and things
started going our way more.  

There was one day, though, when things didn\@t go our way.  At all.  I had
been around for quite some time, and was about to leave when a young bard
came to the foyer and asked if he could sing a song to me.  I said \#okay,\#
went down there, and ended up with a couple of knives from this bad man
named Tilvik in my back.  I died since I wasn\@t ready, which should be a
lesson to anyone reading this, but this was the one and only time Xor and I
were really separated.  

They killed him.  They took him from my hands and split him in two with an
axe, then sacrificed the pieces to some vile god.  I was so sad and angry
and shaking and crying and I didn\@t know what to do.  I went for about two
years without him.  At first I felt really hollow and sad, then friends like
Malusmi and Rulan helped me feel better.  I drew a picture of him on the
chestplate of my armor, showing that no matter what they did, he was always
with me.  Slowly, I learned that the strength Xor had always given me wasn\@t
from him, but it from deep inside of me.

CHAPTER TWO :: Gladiating and Championing

I went into the school of heroes at around age thirteen or fourteen, I
forget.  Xor and I met a young ch\@taren named Artzt who was really nice, and
we all got along super well.  The three of us gained titles up until around
our thirtieth, then Artzt went away.  I always wondered what happened to
him.  

I saw a lot of injustice and bad stuff happening to people.  There was a big
group of mean people who were making other people do stuff for them, and I
didn\@t like it.  It made both Xor and I feel like they were bad.  So I
applied to House Champion, and one day after learning by fighting hordes of
zombies, a nice man came up and invited Xor and I to an interview!  We
talked with another gladiator named Akraelyn, who didn\@t really seem to like
Xor much.  

After talking with him, I was told to go somewhere and think.  I went to a
pool of water in Qilarn, set Xor afloat, and thought about stuff.  Lo and
behold, a bright blue light came into the room, and Jolinn himself appeared!
I was so excited to talk to Him, and everything just seemed to come super
naturally.  The whole time I was distracted, but when He left, I realized
Xor had done nothing while Lord Jolinn was there.  I thought that was odd,
and we had a little talk, where Xor said he was just too humbled.  I thought
\#ok, fine\# and didn\@t ask any further.  

After the day was through, I went back to Akraelyn and talked and he said I
was ready to be a Champion.

CHAPTER ONE :: The Early Years

I was found by my adoptive parents at a young age.  Real young, like two or
three.  My adoptive father was a dockhand on the east docks of Var Bandor. 
He found me clinging to a log, floating down the Aragol river.  I was nearly
drowned, so he scooped me out and took me to his home where his wife took
care of me.  I didn\@t know them long, and that\@s why I don\@t remember their
names.  I guess I never put the log down, and as soon as I started talking,
I started calling it Xor.  I don\@t know where the name came from, but it
just seemed right to me.  

Anyway.  I didn\@t fit in real good with the other dockhands\@ kids.  I\@m an
ethron and they\@re all human, plus I would never let Xor out of my sight. 
He was my best friend, but since I was told so often that he \#saved my
life,\# I thought he was a god of some sort.  He\@d shake and wiggle and we\@d
have the best conversations ever.  I loved him so.  

When I was about six, my adoptive dad came home and passed away.  He\@d been
beaten up so much on the docks over the years by young adventurers, he just
couldn\@t take it anymore.  My adoptive mother was very saddened by this, so
Xor and I left.  I didn\@t know anything else, though, so I stayed on the
streets and did tricks for food.  I didn\@t do anything bad, but I danced and
sang and did stuff to get people to pity me.  

Sometimes I\@d get beat up by others, but me and Xor would always win.  I got
pretty good at fighting back, mostly because Xor was there for me.  One day,
I got in a fight at the end of Raddin street, and Jolcherus saw me take on
three older boys who were bigger than me.  I fought them off, and he said I
was the strongest little girl he ever saw.  He told me he\@d teach me how to
fight all strong-like, and let me in the guild.  He almost made me not take
Xor in, but I begged until he let me.  I was real good at begging.

Hi.  My name\@s Pfusch.  I\@m a Champion who lives by the word of Lord Jolinn.
I\@m also a gladiatrix, but that doesn\@t have much to do with anything I\@m
writing here.  This is a story of my best friend, Xor.  He and I have been
together since I can remember.  Some of this is stuff I know, others of it
is stuff I was told.  I\@m going to start with that first.

{W\#Pegasus Defiled\#{n
[continued]

Even Zelenaes, Templar of Light,
Could do nothing in all his so-called might.
Crumbling weakly under the powerful attack,
The needed strength he terribly lacked.

And yet glorious walls glistened still,
Yet not in their familiar hue;
Decorated with blood from the newly dead,
The lovely stone looked better red.

Void symbols inscribed on the hallowed ground,
Miasma spread with a whisper of a sound,
Fountain poisoned with magic dark,
The temple seemed so beautifully stark.

Shattered Pegasus, fallen from flight,
Defiled temple, corrupted by Night,
Bloodied walls and fountains cursed,
Lightbringers Shrine, in Shadow immersed.

Shining Pegasus, graceful in flight,
Holy temple, bastion of Light,
Gleaming walls and fountains grand,
Sheltered by Lightbringers Hand.

And yet I still can vivid see:
It struggled with such urgency.
The marble Pegasus gasped for breath,
Then, slowly, painfully, gave in to death.

Marble wings did chip and shatter,
Crashing down with a high-pitched clatter.
A crippled corpse to mark its grave.
The glowing temple it could not save.

The temple halls were quickly hushed,
When in an unsurprising rush,
The Piper of Joy was easily slain,
His awful melodies faded away.

Amielu, of the killing arts,
Ever generous with deadly darts,
Doesn\@t seem to recognize,
She looks on the world with blinded eyes.

For though Death is her own profession,
She\@s angered when a bard dares mention,
Violent things within his song;
She feels such a thing is terribly wrong.

Jaeri, too, a foolish mage,
Better locked up in a cage,
So that just in case stupidity\@s contagious,
We won\@t end up like this bumbling magus.

Then Angednon, Prince of Bards,
A mouthpiece he is, nothing more.
Spouting tripe left and right,
What\@s worse, tripe he did not write.

He speaks of spreading the \@Good Word\@,
And yet worse words I\@ve never heard.
If only he had half a brain,
Then perhaps his audience he\@d entertain.

From these words you must understand,
The danger posed by this poisonous band.
And like all poisons it must be,
Removed quickly and unmercifully.

A poison is coursing through the land,
A poison in the form of an idiot band.
Just listen close and I\@ll sing to you,
Of this band\@s members, from old to new.

Riolan, Champion covered with fur,
Presence as bothersome as a burr.
Though many days he\@s certainly seen,
This sadly has not quelled his idiocy.

For he believes in the way of the light,
Feeling his path is the only one right.
Just as the others of his kind,
He suffers from a closed mind.

Phaela, mage of Jolinn\@s seas,
Enjoys a lot of company.
I\@ve heard she goes in search to find,
Companions of the manly kind.

And yet despite her scandalous ways,
To some she\@ll not give the time of day.
But rather judge them on the spot,
For these ones are part of a \@darksome lot\@.

Chadim, Champion of the Wind,
Very much the same as his kin,
For he, too, displays prejudice,
And, beyond that, is a hypocrite.

It whipped and lashed its slender limbs,
Tearing flesh and ripping skin.
It slapped its branches violently,
All its rage directed at me.

I fought at first, but soon surrendered;
Seeking peace was my last endeavor.
With the taste of blood upon my lip,
I slowly gave in to Death\@s icy grip.

Stunning pain caressed my soul,
I screamed and howled without control.
Yet not a sound escaped my lips,
For I had no lips
 I was nothingness.

A chill surrounded my entire form,
A chill that froze and scorched in turn.
The pain increased unmercifully,
Intensifying my silent scream.

I floated aimlessly thru the scenery stark,
The blackness deeper than twilight is dark.
Hopelessly waiting for the feelings to cease,
Though I feared the pain could only increase.

Seconds or years, I cannot be sure,
Exactly how long I had to endure.
Yet finally my spirit\@s journey was halted.
Away from the pain I was gladly escorted.

As I was reunited with the living world,
My ghostly wings I slowly unfurled.
Then sighing deeply in honest relief,
My bloody corpse I set off to greet.

Dropping keys to the silver gates,
Opening the Garden unto its fate.

Strolling under lush fruit trees,
We picked our share from the bounty.
Packs and robes filled with labor\@s fruits,
We set about the Garden to mute.

Statues of Rose Lover\@s filled the space,
Statues of Rose Lover\@s were quickly defaced.
In the once-vibrant Garden, a storm did blaze;
A storm of fire, the Garden to raze.

All hints of love and life nearly gone,
Pleased with our work, a symbol was drawn,
To witness the Rose\@s withering fall,
The words were intoned: \@The Eye does see all.\@

Both blessed Shrines giving way,

Such a shame, not yet full-grown.

The twinkle in her bright green eyes,
Hesitated in surprise,
As from its sheathed home it came,
Piercing fiercely at her brain.
Savagely the blade did cut,
Splashing blood throughout the hut.

The ring upon her lovely hand,
That little silver and ivory band,
Instilled in me an unrighteous lust,
Have it then I knew I must.

As the blade slashed \@cross her wrist,
The connecting tendons it did kiss.
And falling limply to the ground,
Her hand did sit, a bloody mound.

As one last breath escaped her lips,

Then reaching calmly towards the hand,
I carefully retrieved the sacred band.

And as the two began to converse,
An agreement was established and slowly nursed.

The Demon would, with an unholy spell,
Miraculously cure the one the fever befell.
But in return for this glorious act,
There was something the Demon had to ask back.

Eternal servitude would be her portion,
Slave to a Demon as her fortune.
But moved by the love in her heart for her mate,
She begrudgingly complied to the horrible fate.

As her lover recovered so well,
After the Demon had cast its spell,
Things seemed to return to the way they had been,
The two laughing and kissing day out and day in.

Yet not a month passed before the Demon returned,
For a payment of dues the creature did yearn.
Approaching the lass, it gave a command:
The death of her lover, by her very own hand!

And as she approached his resting form,
She kept on weeping ever more and more.

As the knife did pierce his chest,
His eyes were opened from their rest.
And as he stared at her in shock,
Again and again the blade did drop.

As he ceased to live at last,
The woman gained her senses back.
And in her pained and sorrowed state,
Stabbed herself at a rapid rate.

The gentry called from near and far, to hear and Kyais Feaer
It seemed the only unbespelled ones gazed back from a mirror

{YK{nyais played the clarinet, and beat upon the drums
Music made on pipes as well, and on a guitar strummed
Few Lords called without begging to hear him play the flute
But Kyais Feaer would nightly end with an Old, and Aged Lute

{YC{nut from the tree before Kyais Feaer was ever born
Played in castles now to dust, their walls and ceilings torn
Passed down through years uncounted, grandfather to grandson
The Old and Aged Lute was held by thirty now, and one

{YI{nts sound so sweet and mellow, its finish clear and bright
It passed to me when Kyais Feaer passed on into the Light
True to its loving legacy, I tune it once again
To bring joy to the peaceful, and peace to those in pain

{YS{nhould ever line be broken, and grandson never found
This Old and Aged Lute shall be committed to the ground
But do not weep to see the fruit of Celanim rot away
Undying, it will come again, to sing, another day.

A short poem is written on this page in a long, flowing hand:

Once upon a time, there was a mangy cur
His mongrel mother sadly named him Khesyn
His words were always spoken with a slur
And his attitude just wasn\@t very pleasin\@
He used to get his pleasure in a brothel
But soon, he couldn\@t get it in a shack
Because Khesyn got gelded for his trouble
And later gave his soul to get \@em back
If you ever see that ugly cur
And wonder why his trousers seem too baggy
You won\@t understand the answer through his slur
(it\@s cause his newfound jewels ain\@t quite so shaggy).

A long poem is written on this page in a long, flowing hand: 

Anaides of Alensha boarded the Icewing from Jh\@ten
A life of idyllic pastures left behind
With determination, he and the ship rode on the wind
While storm and fury tore at sail and line
Limping to Earendam\@s stony harbor in the end
A rough and torn Anaides leapt ashore
And then he turned his back upon the waves of the Uthlin
Anaides of Alensha, famed of lore
He traveled to Earendam, and then he went on by
Destined for ever more and greater feats
He soon served as an anchor for those who sought the Light
Anaides\@ match he seldom was to meet
Against the hordes of evil, Anaides led his men
And fought and bled beside them day and night
Victorious, he still held vigil knowing that again
Some dark force would threaten peace and light
From north and south and east and west, Aramril felt the siege
Against might and deceit in nearly equal share
Anaides of Alensha stood constant vigil for his Liege:
Jolinn, Lord of the Sapphire Spear

{WThe Dove\@s Song{n

A dove beneath the weathered sky,
Wondering as the fortunes fly,
Wondering as the days drift by.

The crowd has gathered with a sneer,
Glimmering eye and poisoned ear.
A wondrous tale they wish to hear.

\#And shall I sing with all my heart,
Of beasts, of braves, of men apart?
(How and where should I even start?)\#

And should that dove begin to sing,
Upon a prayer and whispered wing,
Oh, please, give Her just one thing:

For when upon the count of three,
Give her the time so she may see
The perfect chance in which to flee.

Adorned in shining steel,
I\@d strive for wrong; I\@d strive for right
I\@d strive for half a meal.

Or maybe I should ride the bird,
And don the hidden hood.
Then lose myself within the herd --
I\@d be misunderstood.

How about the Champion\@s praise?
I\@d preach of peace and love--
Oh, who am I to kid these days?
They\@d never want a Dove.

Or should I shun the blinding light
And wrap myself in Veil?
I must admit they look affright;
They are too gravely pale.

I\@d rather stand and take the Watch;
A Guardsman, true and true.
A heavy pike, a glass of scotch,
And be ousted on review.

Alas, alack, a troubled life,
A singer I shall be.
I\@ll sing of love and sing of strife,
And pray you weep for me.

When all the gods did brag.

When all our hopes did drag.

Drowning in your punic lies,
Seeking for the heart.

{WThe Dread Dastil{n

Beyond the hills, beyond the waves,
Beyond the reaches of the graves,
Where morning light does loathe to shine
And shivers edge across the spine,
The shadowed beasts of evening creep
Along the gloom and darkness deep.

They stalked the Plains and past the Road,
And through the night their anguish flowed,
For bathed in sin and stripped of pride,
These creatures with their calls deride
All joys from life. They echo still;
The mournful cries: \#Dasss-til! Dasss-til!\#

Yet amidst the clamorous roar,
Emerged three heroes armed for war,
With strength of heart, and hope in mind.
They braved the depths of walls confined,
Until at last, they fought the brood,
And slew the Dastils where they stood.

And cheer arose from all the land,
With joyous songs and stories grand,
The three strode forth with heads held high,
For gentle was the dawning sky,
And not a cloud did mar the light,
Nor diminish the humbling sight.

Hiding is not so great a sin.
When furies roar and spirits fall,
Cower before the crash and din.

The cry is sung

Brave men stand with heads held tall;
Hiding is not so great a sin.

Insolent wolves marched kin by kin,
Lay sprawled upon the City Wall,
Slaughtered before the crash and din.

Their lines were crushed and hope grew thin,
And on the Wind a voice did call,
\#Hiding\@s not so great a sin!\#.

Yet one question still stirs within,
Where was Lania through it all?
Was she caught in the crash and din?

No, she was safe, asleep within.
And who can blame her after all:
For hiding\@s not so great a sin,
Who can tell above the crash and din?

Shall once again the soul give chase.

Where are the seers to wake the dead?
And where the eyes to guide the head?--
For up upon the broken hill,
The mighty giant slumbers still;
With faith against the rising tide,
And dreams beyond the simple pride.

Arise! Arise!         The trumpet calls --
The sound that shakes the very walls,
And stirs within that haunting cry
That sends the soul towards the sky;
The light that shines and breaks the gloom,
To rouse the damned from hoary tomb.

 O\@ Knights of glory, Knights of yore,

\#Yet at some point Korus met his match.  Sorely injured, scorched and
seared, he emerged from the smoke, finding his way back to the surface only
through luck and perhaps divine benevolence.  He was borne back to his home
with all possible speed by those \@hero-worshippers\@ who had followed him
about, hoping to gain might as well, but during the many days it took to
return he worsened even more.  

The healer of the town, a young woman by name of Shinnann (see Shinnann
(auth.  Note: little is known of this girl, short of her training in the
ways of the water scholar and failed training as a priestess of Rystaia (see
-Rystaia-, -Order of the Pegasus-, -Chosen-))), only recently finished her
apprenticeship, spent hours plying her craft on the torn, burnt shell that
was Korus the farmer.  Though she called upon the magics of water to heal
his body and her little knowledge of the spirit realm to cure his soul, not
all of the damage was reparable.  

In the standard maudlin way of things, after several weeks he had fallen in
love with his savior.  During the time of his recovery, regardless of the
truth or not, he was given the name Death to the Deathless: An\@athanatos. 
So popular it was that he eventually took it as his own.  This is Korus\@
only known vanity, his only deviation from his monk-like asceticism.\#

\#Korus disappeared into anonymity for several years after his exploits
with the dragon.  It is a long-debated question, as to why he went off on
such a rant.  Some say that his family was killed by shuddeni, some say that
he wanted to see the world, and others, less enamored with his heroism, say
that he was an uncultured peasant with a taste for blood.  In the opinion of
this humble scribbler of history, he acquired a bent for the risk and danger
of living the life of a vigilante champion, drawing on his own ascetic inner
strength to sustain him.  

Even more highly questioned is -what- he actually did during the years
between meeting his wife (see Shinnann) and the episode with the dragon. 
Though there are no longer many existing records, a flurry of shuddeni
correspondence was found, mostly to those within the military, \@clergy\@, or
Assassins (mostly Nefortu)(see -Assassin-, -Red Hand-)- most of these
letters were, sadly, destroyed in the Library Fire decades ago.  

They all concern the threat of, I gather, a Ch\@taren swordmaster who almost
single-handedly penetrated deep into the heart of Yithoul (see Yithoul,
Temple of Yithoul) over a period of several months, going deeper and deeper
each time, until he broached the lower levels of the notorious catacombs
beneaths (see -Catacombs of Yithoul-....  Onyx?  Basalt?)  , where he fought
with some of the Older forces of evil the world has known, striking such
fear into the demons and beasts that all was quiet for quite some time after
his departure.

\#Finally, as the lands were encased in a shell of frigidity and snow began
to mask the dragon\@s tracks, they saw a massive pillar of smoke, towering to
the sky.  Day after day as they got closer they saw the eaves of the forest
Nendor(see -Forests-, -Eril-.  See also -Motive Trees-, -Flesh Saplings-)
were aflame.  They met with several other bands who also hunted the beast,
some professional mercenaries, some guardsmen, and some simple farmers like
K.  In an attempt to flush the wyrm out from the forest, where it could
dodge, strike, and run, wearing down the militiamen (see -Form of the
Dragon-, -Swordmaster-), the hunters had set fire to the forest, yet only
ended up providing a screen of heat and smoke for it to shelter behind.

Due to the beast\@s ferocious nature (?  See frenzy?)  , this also only
served to aggravate it further.  That very night, while most of the pursuers
slept, the fire burned low, still smouldering, but tolerable for the dragon.
Seizing the opportunity, it attacked, scattering the makeshift camp and
catching its inhabitants completely off guard.  Death cries of many tongues
reached to the heavens that night as the dragon took advantage of the dark
and cold to destroy most of the camp.

Korus, spared from the dragon through the help of Berakiel, seized up a long
pike dropped by a Kor Thrandian soldier (see -Pike-, -Kor Thrandir-,
-Vorinden Pass-.  See also -Shuddeni-).  As the beast reared to devour him,
Korus struck the beast in the neck, using its impetus to penetrate deep into
the dragon\@s flesh.  The pike-head snapped off, leaving the blessed head in
the wyrm\@s neck.  Greviously injured and burned by the sanctified metal, the
dragon fled into the trees.

Korus pursued, inflicting several minor wounds on the serpent with his
blade, and chased it to the brink of a cleft in the earth.  There they
fought, among the acrid fumes and glowing ash left by the spent inferno. 
Because of the terrible injury dealt to it, the beast was sorely weakened,
leveling the odds considerably.  After only a few minutes, the young
Ch\@taren (see -Ch\@taren-, -Day of Two Dawns-) was able to force the beast
backwards off the edge, where it slid into the darkness with a shriek of
rage.\#

\#Korus An\@athanatos is one of the more ephemeral figures in Avendarian
history, due to his sudden rise and disappearance in the \@adventuring
scene\@, as the younger in my profession call it.  His exploits are quite
difficult to track, due to his retiring, shy nature and his short period of
public life.  Such a brief span of time eliminates the ability to sort out
truth from rumor due to the fact that no pattern of behavior was
established.

When Korus was a relatively young man, shortly after receiving his allotment
of my great-grandfather\@s land, the emerald dragon (see -Wyrm-, -Drachen-,
or -Serpent-)(see also -Armor-), full of the hale and vigor of youth, roamed
the lands freely, indavertently causing chaos wherever it passed.  Korus, at
the will of his family and the others in his village, left Morn (see
-Forests-, -Inessa-) with the local militia to find the dragon and drive it
back.

When in the easy process of tracking the beast (following the massive swath
of charred wreckage), Korus met with Berakiel (the grandfather of Belarik
Smith: See -Belarik-, or -The Rock-)who first introduced him to the use of
the blade.  The young farmer quickly found that he had an innate skill with
the sword.  Rapidly gaining a reputation for tact and tenacity as a fighter
among the ragtag militia, he began to make infrastructural suggestions to
their putative leader, eventually reforming the unit into a well-knit,
cohesive body.

Several days passed, and it seemed as if they had made no
further progress on catching up to it.  Due to the peregrinous nature of
their wanderings, little is known about the succesion of the Dragon\@s
attacks: however, we can safely say that it traveled over a good deal of
Avendar, due to the dating of some unique wreckage.  (see -Dusk of the
Dragon-)

This cardboard scrapbook is made from an assortment of parchment pages
pasted and bound together between two covers.  The entire book is written in
the same neat, curling hand, as though someone copied everything out before
adding it to the collection.  The first page reads:

I was born Kald An\@athanatos, to Shinnann Tookrysen and Korus An\@athanatos. 
My father Korus was originally a simple tiller of the earth, growing wheat
and grapes in the fields surrounding Inessa.  He loves the growing things,
and will spend hours out among his crops and return well after dark,
smelling of fresh soil.  My mother, a healer of Inessa, dabbles in her trade
for the small and minor injuries recieved by the villagers in our lovely
town.  She is most fond of crushing and fermenting the grapes and other
berries my father grows to make delicate cordials, with which she sometimes
mixes her medicines.  My brother Luyan, twin to me in body and soul, is the
most dear person to me in all of the world...  We soon set out to travel the
lands, seeking to bring the light of faith and purity to all that we may
hope to touch with our own humble abilities and the divine aid of Our Lady.

{WThe Bears of Goran{n

Though their presence has been lost in time due to their reclusive nature,
the wood of Goran is populated with these large, intelligent animals.
Thought to be a creation of Lord Jolinn, the Bears of Goran are highly
civilized and more than one traveller lost in the woods has been aided by
these light-following creatures.

Beyond their dedication to helping those in their wood, and their ties with
the Titans, little is known about these bears, including why they prefer to
remain so cut off from the rest of civilization.

{WThe Vesler Snake{n

Rumoured to live in distant swamps on another continent, the vesler snake,
also known as the one-eyed snake, has one of the most toxic venoms of any
land bound creature.  Used by alchemists and assassins of yore, just one
nick of a blade coated in the venom is said to render the victim paralyzed,
if not dead.  Those who have survived encounters with the vesler snake\@s
venom are often left blinded or retain partial paralysis.  Reliable
information on the snake is difficult to find, as the vesler was hunted
into near extinction, not only for its potent venom but also for its
beautiful blue shimmering blue scales, which are highly prized and priced
by any knowledgeable on the subject.

{WThe Blade of Varmein (The Blade of Magic){n

Forged in times past the Blade of Varmein, or as it is more commonly
known, the Blade of Magic, was created by one of the ancient Alatharya\@s
greatest craftsmen and scholars.  What scraps of information remain tell
of years of preparation and powerful rituals the like of which modern
Avendar has never seen.  The end result was the Blade of Varmein, most
likely named after its creator, a weapon which contained the perfect meld
of magic and steel.  So strong was the force of energy put into this
blade that holding it was akin to holding a slice of pure magic.  Kept in
the ancient capital, it was displayed in their tower of artifacts as a
symbol of the perfect unity of magic and the material plane.

When the Sundering occurred, a terrible explosion tore apart the tower the
Blade of Varmein was kept in, as the blade was so pure that it was also
divided.  The explosion was so great that none in the tower survived
and nothing remained but a fine sand, the remnants of the stone of which
it had been built.  Rumours have circulated since that the blade remains
on Avendar this day, but in many pieces scattered throughout the world.
Myth and fairytale tell of six blades which united will again form the
ancient weapon, but those familiar with the subject believe a seventh
blade to be needed to unite the six, a center for the power to be focused
through.

As to what will happen if the blades are reunited, that is even more of
a mystery.  According to fairytale, the world will once again have access
to the pure form of magic lost so long ago.  Legend, however, warns of a
day in the future when the children of the Three seek to undo what They
have done, and merge the six powers into one once more.  This day, the
legends predict, will be the end of all that is Avendar.  Most who study
the histories doubt something so extreme and a few adventurers of past
have sought to find these mythical blades, though none have yet found
concrete evidence that the Blade of Varmein exists in any form at all.

This taste for exotic matter is possible because 
elementals as such do not transfer their physical 
matter from the plane of earth -- to do so would require
opening a stable gateway to that plane, which would 
require far more concentration and mana expenditure.

Rather, when an elemental is summoned, the animus, 
or animating spirit of an elemental is conjured, and 
they inhabit a shell of matter in the prime material. Of
course, the power and versatility of the spirit called 
will depend on the proximity of the caster to the plane
of earth. It is well known that elementals conjured in
caves or fissures have greater strength, resulting in 
this property.

*The rest of the text concerns technical matters, 
including various tests of hardness and magical 
strength.*

{WOn the Character of the Planar Beings of Earth{n:

As is well known, the scholars of earth have used
servants from that elemental plane since the 
dawning of their art. According to myth, elementals
were even used in the construction of parts of the old 
city, helping to build the city\@s walls when labor grew
scarce.

Little has been written about the nature of the common
elemental, however, and I have written this text to 
make a general study of the subject.

Now, unlike those who dabble in the void, we do not 
call our elemental servants unwillingly into the 
prime material, nor do we threaten or bribe them. 
Rather, most elementals of earth actually crave the 
unfamiliar taste of matter in the prime material, and 
enjoy helping scholars create new structures of
matter, or rearrange existing structures.

Many years after the War of Night, when the Spirit Palace had become
fairly well established, it was noticed that some strange activity was
happening in the caves of Mount Enrien.  Unsettled by this, as it was very
close to the prison of the demon lord Kzroth, a few scholars were sent to
explore and establish what had happened.  

In the mountain they found a group of nefortu who referred to themselves as
\#Kohli\# and appeared to be the last remanents of a divergent race which had
lived for many years deep underground.  Observing the kohli while invisible,
it was eventually deduced that some massive, evil creature had forced them
from their homes, and was responsible for their now sparse population.  The
amber dragon, upon hearing the details, realized it was the void dragon
Tzet-Sabanthe.  

Knowing the pure corruption and evil that the dark dragon was, the amber
dragon sought it and drove it off, unwilling to allow it to destroy an
entire race.  The kohli, thankful and awestruck, came to worship the amber
dragon as their deity, and elected to stay in their new city, close to their
god.  It was not until sometime later that the details of this were
discovered, however, due to the generally seclusive nature of the amber
dragon.  
~
E
tome4~
Knowing the demon must be stopped, or it would most likely succeed in
destroying the palace, Arch-Mage Vosatair went out to fight him alone,
giving his body up to become a true avatar.  By giving all his soul to
his transformation, he became more powerful than any before him, burning
up his own life energy.  The battle between the Arch-Mage and Kzroth was
long, but eventually Kzroth was weakened enough to be trapped.  The
remaining Maevis\@Hra fled at his defeat, and Kzroth was locked in a
magically warded cell within the mountain.  When the cell was closed,
the Arch-Mage fell and as the consuming light dissipated, so did he, until
nothing remained of either.

E
tome3~
The Spirit Palace, in all its beauty and glory, has attracted many who
hate it for those it houses.  Between the six magics a balance has always
existed, keeping a peace that is understood by most powerful scholars.
Envy and hate cloud reason, however, and during the rule of the fifth
great Arch-Mage, Gaene Vosatair, dark stirrings were heard.  A group of
void and fire scholars broke from their guilds to create their own sect,
the Maevis\@Hra, which loosely translates into \#Bringers of Darkness\#.
Hoping to eliminate the presence of the golden light that is Spirit,
they performed many dark rituals, a twisted meld of pain and darkness.
Believing themselves strong enough to fight this small sect, the many
schools of spirit around Avendar prepared to defend themselves, and those
at the palace settled down for war.

To the spirit scholars, triumph was never in doubt.  The Arch-Mage,
however, had underestimated the Maevis\@Hra and their fanatical devotion
to their cause.  The night the Maevis\@Hra struck has been burned into
legend as the greatest tragedy ever to befall the scholars of Spirit.
All over Avendar spirit schools were besieged by scholars and their vile
demons.  The guild in Drellan Myr fell early, burned to the ground by
unnatural fires, and not leaving any survivors.  For the Spirit Palace
was saved the darkwalkers strongest ally, the demon lord Kzroth, a being of
fire and destruction.  He cut through the palace defences easily,
feasting on the bodies of those he killed, and growing stronger for each
one.
~
E
tome2~
The Spirit Palace was first suggested about a decade after the magics of
air had been let loose upon the land.  Realizing the destructive force
of pure entropy, and the seeming weakening of the barrier between the magic
of air and the prime material in the clouds around the ancient Mountain
Enrien, a young human scholar suggested a place of work and magic be
built nearby.  Not only would this palace serve to watch over the beings
of chaos that roamed this energy-charged place, but it would also be a
symbol of the strength and hope that spirit magic itself represented.
The young man, Heclan Nayber, would become the first Arch-Mage of the
Spirit Palace, and its first leader.  Always wise beyond his years, his
decision was oft proven a good one as time progressed.

\#They have given up their lives and meaning to you because yours was the
path of least resistance.  These empty husks cannot be relied upon to save
your life.  If you had lead a life of challenge and strife, instead of
living a life of ease, hidden behind the excuse of your Vow of Pacifism and
content behind the so-called safety of your masses and sainthood, then
perhaps you could have had a chance.\#  Stated Vashel in a calm voice.  She
watched impassively as Brezistem screamed in rage and sorrow, reaching
within his robe for a hidden dagger and charging at her with nothing on his
mind but the preservation of his own life.  

With a single fluid motion, Vashel unsheathed her blade with god-like speed
and slew the raving holy man as he charged with a flimsy dagger in his hand.
In that same fluid motion she turned and proceeded to walk down the path of
the mountain, the pitiful cries of Brezistem\@s followers welling up behind
her as they realized that now they would once again have the responsibility
to make and accept the consequences of their own actions.  

With that our tale ends, as Vashel heads from her fourth Trial: to slay two
men, as different from each other as light is to day, but yet similar in
less obvious ways.  Though different, both had the same corrosive affect
upon the people around them, and both had been silenced so that people in
that day and age could be forged to a higher potential.  From this fourth
Trial, Vashel strode purposefully onwards to her fifth, unmindful of the
need for rest, but only with the thought of finishing her quest.
~
E
tome6~
Thus it was an act of utter simplicity once more for Vashel to climb to
the summit of the mountain, where Brezistem had chosen to live, surrounded
by his followers whom he treated as servants in return for his teachings. 
Here he stood by the door as he cried plaintively to Vashel when she strode
close, \#Why?  Why do you do this, and why do my followers not save me from
my peril?\#  

\#Because you have corrupted these servants of yours so that they are nothing
but shadows, without will and honor.  This new world and age requires beings
of strength who are willing to enter the crucible to be made stronger and
purer, not those who do not even have the will to make decisions for
themselves\# replied Vashel.
~
E
tome5~
The second mortal for the fourth trial dwelt high in the mountains.  He
was a holy messiah by the name of Brezistem, who was known by many as the
Saint of Peace.  Legend has it that Brezistem had gone through life never
taking the life of another.  In his middle years he retreated to a mountain
where he gathered followers, whom he then preached the art of peace to. 
Each of them had sworn a Vow of Pacifism, to never harm the life of another.
Thousands of his followers upon the mountain awoke each morning to fasting
and meditation, in order so that they could more quickly reach a state where
they would never be able to harm the life of another ever again.

It was then upon the eve to a dark night that Vashel climbed the
mountain, carrying a torch to announce her presence.  To all whom asked,
Vashel announced that she had come to slay their holy man, Brezistem.  His
followers were aghast, but were unable even to muster a suitable defense
against her.  Too many of them were stricken by the realization that their
Oath barred their way, and could do nothing but stand by as they saw her
climb trail up the mountain.  Some attempted to form a barrier before her,
but days of fasting and lack of physical activity had left them too weak to
truly even be noticed by Vashel as she swept by.
~
E
tome4~
\#Why?  Why do you do this, and why do my followers not save me from my
peril?\#  He cried from his throne.  

\#Because you have corrupted these servants of yours so that they are nothing
but shadows, who are without will and honor.  This new world and age
requires beings of strength who are willing to enter the crucible to be made
stronger and purer, not those who do not even have the will to make
decisions for themselves\# replied Vashel.  \#They have given up their lives
and meaning to you out of fear and coersion.  These empty husks cannot be
relied upon to save your life.  If you had but remained the warrior you were
in the past, instead of living a life of sloth, content behind the so-called
safety of your masses, then perhaps you could have had a chance.\#  Stated
Vashel in a calm voice, as she unsheathed her blade with god-like speed and
slew the cowering Onzen upon his throne.  In that same fluid motion she had
turned and proceeded to walk out of the Dark Valley, without a single motion
of resistance by Onzen\@s thousands of followers.  
~
E
tome3~
With that, our tale begins as Vashel heads to face her fourth Trial: to
slay two men, as different from each other as light is to day, but yet
similar in less obvious ways.  The first man was named Onzen, the self
titled Tyrant of the Dark Valley of Arisuth, before the Tower had yet been
conceived.  Onzen was known and feared throughout his region as a once
powerful warrior that had conquered the valley, and built his dark throne
there.  From there, his enslaved worshippers performed dark rites and
sacrifices to appease their master.  

To slay this foe Vashel approached the valley at the dawn of the new day. 
Tired and dazed from their night of unholy rituals, most of Onzen\@s
followers were too befuddled to even consider resistance.  Of the thousands
massed in the valley, most of them had already lost their will to fight and
were but empty shells that only blindly accepted the orders of their master.
Thus it was a matter of utter simplicity for Vashel to stride to the center
of the valley, where Onzen sat upon his throne.  It became apparent from a
distance that Onzen the mighty warrior had atrophied from years of indulgent
living, and now could barely muster the energy to move himself from his
throne.  When finally Onzen became cognizant of his danger, his shrill voice
carried far and high, demanding first assistance, and then to beg for mercy
when none of his followers would stand against Vashel.  
~
E
tome2~
While not much is known of Vashel\@s beginnings, it is known that she and
her brother were two sides of a same coin.  One walked with a tune in his
heart and wanderlust in his soul, the other walked with the grim resolve of
a soul of steel and the calm quiet of determination in her heart.  But both
knew honor and courage, and it was that which held these two sides together.


It was Vashel, however, who pursued a path less-traveled.  She walked to
test her skills and her mettle, but in doing so she also wished to prove the
worth of these new races to the eyes of the Gods.  While the alatharya had
brought dishonor to all mortals by their jealousy and treachery, Vashel
strove to show that the new races would not stray down that path.  It would
come to be that after a score of years, Vashel\@s quest finally captured the
attention of Dolgrael, the Divine of War.  

The legendary year-long discussion between the two, deep within the Forge of
Dolgrael, is the stuff and myth of another tale entirely, but suffice to say
that at the end of it, an accord had been reached.  Dolgrael had given
Vashel nine Trials to prove to him the worth of these new races.  And with
that she set out, not yet knowing that these trials in their entirety would
span the length of decades, but such was her resolve that even had she known
she would only have moved onward with the same determination.  
~
E
tome1~
{WThe Fourth Trial of Vashel{n

Recorded by Nehruin, high priest of the Lord Dolgrael

In those days following the Sundering the races knew fear for the world had
been changed, and paradise had been lost forever.  In those dangerous times
mortals were forced to forge new paths and new ways to survive.  Magic and
lore had been divided, and as the dangers of the wild encroached, people
clung to whatever fragments would suit them best.  Those who lived within
the woods practiced the arts of forest and nature, while those who lived in
the mountains lived and died by the arts of stone and earth.  But even in
these dangerous times, there were those people who thrived in the
possibilities of the age.  These were the people who spent not their lives
purely on the basis of survival, but on something far more epic.

One of these mortals came from a village whose name has long since been lost
to the ashes of time.  She was Vashel, the first mistress of the sword art
known as Aktzezehye\@ginta, a sword form known for the deadly speed in which
a blade could be unsheathed.  Often for the masters of the Aktzezehye\@ginta,
it is possible to slay one\@s foe without the foe ever realizing the blade
has been drawn.

GARNET
======
Usually a deep red in colour, garnet can rarely also be found in shades 
of blue and purple.  Often, unless held up to the light, a garnet can 
appear to be a solid black.  A common aid for memory, and worn to ward 
off headaches and nightmares, garnet is a fairly mundane stone, and 
frequently found in srryn beadwork.

Though it is not a particularly strong stone, garnet is useful for 
minor enchantments, and is especially good at warding off the cold, when 
used correctly.

Garnet is the birthstone for the month of Valectis, and is thought to 
bring luck and warmth to those born during this cold month.

living on the stage, the emerald is easy to enspell with glamours to make 
the owner more appealing.  Also, to sleep wearing an emerald is said to 
enhance the dreams of the sleeper, leaving them inspired by the realms 
of their unconscious when they wake.
~
E
diamond~
DIAMOND
=======
Arguably among the most powerful of stones, diamonds are valued by 
scholars and nobles alike.  While they are quite rare, they are also 
difficult to mine, causing their value on the market to be quite high!

The gem itself is said to bring clarity of thought, an obvious aid to any
spellcaster.  Beyond that, it holds well nearly any enchantment put upon
it.  It is especially useful at absorbing spells that grant the wearer
resistance to hostile magics, and increased mental energy.  Diamonds are
also useful in that they amplify the other stones powers, making anything
they are set with much stronger.

Some scholars theorize that the hardness of a stone, that is its 
durability and difficulty to break, is directly related to the strength of 
the enchantments it can hold.  Indeed, the diamond seems to be a prime 
example of this phenomenon (termed the Grasie Rule by the scholar who
first set it out, Rolane Grasie.)
~
E
citrine~
CITRINE
=======
Citrine tends to a bright yellow in colour, and bears a close relation 
to amethyst in formation, though is less favoured.  A fairly common 
stone, it is a symbol of loyalty, faithfulness, and youth.  It is also 
said that wearing a piece of citrine about the throat brings energy to the 
wearer.

It is best enchanted with protective magics, but is relatively poor at 
holding any other sort of spell.  Therefore, it is often put aside in 
favour of strong cousins.

Its sparkling warm colour destined it to be the birthstone of those 
born during the Dawning.
~
E
carnelian~
CARNELIAN
=========
Carnelian is a lovely bright orange to reddish orange colour, which 
slowly becomes more and more red the longer it is left in the sun.  Yet 
another variety of quartz, it aids clear thinking as many of the quartz 
family do.  It is also said to be good for the skin, clearing blemishes 
and aiding the healing of scars and such marks.  It is a useful stone 
in that it can be enchanted with many minor enchantments, but shows no 
clear bias to any particular magic.

Carnelian is the stone of the Reaping, and is oft worn by children of that
month to promote fertility.
~
E
bloodstone~
BLOODSTONE
==========
Despite its name, bloodstone is a deep pine green in colour.  It actually
gets its name from the flecks of dark red buried within the green rock,
said to be the crystallized remains of the blood of Varharl, the legendary
titan.  People today generally wear it for aid with their circulation, but
there is little magical worth in it beyond that.

Bloodstone is, of course, the birthstone of the month of the Sundering, 
the month Varharl gave his life to save many of the inhabitants of 
Avendar.
~
E
aquamarine~
AQUAMARINE
==========
Another fairly weak gem magically speaking, the aquamarine is none-the-
less valued highly in some cultures.  Sailors and those who live close
to the ocean believe the stone lucky, and superstitiously think it to
bring good fortune to seafarers.  The origin of this belief is unclear, 
but it is thought to be a practice of worship for some long forgotten 
god.  In some villages the strength of their belief is so strong that if 
a person accidentally cracks or breaks a piece of aquamarine, they will 
not sail for a full year, believing baleful spirits will seek revenge.
~
E
amethyst~
AMETHYST
========
This type of quartz is renown for its lovely purple colour; the more 
intense the hue, the more valued the gem.  A great many scholars wear 
this stone, as it aids in meditation and mental tranquility.  Some people
also use it in day-to-day life, as it is thought to give a boost to the
immune system.  Some nobles are partial to goblets adorned with amethysts,
or carved entirely out of the stone, as it is said to curb drunkenness.

For those who study arcane magic, this stones power is limited, at 
best.  Many of those newer to the magics of enchantment may erroneously 
believe its deep purple colour would lend itself to properties spiritual 
in nature (due to the seventh chakra).  In actuality the flawed nature 
of amethyst quartz does not hold well any spells cast upon it.
~
E
amber~
AMBER
=====
Generally a brownish orange to light yellow in colour, amber tends to 
be translucent, even when unpolished.  The kankorans believe it to be 
solidified sunlight, and value the gem highly.  The kohli people value 
the stone even more so, as it is quite rare in their cave habitats, and 
it holds some religious significance as well.

A weak stone as far as magical ability is concerned, it is useful for 
minor benefits, or occasionally as an aid for channeling air magics.  
Many wise women and healers praise it for its positive effects on those 
who have arthritis or similar pains of the joints.

{WGEMSTONES OF AVENDAR{n 

{D========================{n 

As any earth scholar would be pleased to tell you, stone is very
important to the world of magic.  Even more so, however, are the precious
and semi-precious gems we mine from it.  Few things are as potent as a
channel, and focus, as the correct gemstone used in the correct manner.

While any gem, and really any thing, can be enchanted thus, certain gems
have an undeniable affinity with particular abilities and protections.  One
could enspell an emerald or a citrine, for example, to grant the user
extended mental energies, and such an enchantment would hold.  Had the
caster been more particular, and used a pearl perhaps, the benefit of that
same spell could have as much as tripled!

Within these pages I shall give brief outlines of the description of each
stone, and a short summary of the folklore and traits associated with them. 
Indeed, one need not be able to channel magic to find benefit from many of
the gems listed herein.

onyx~
ONYX
====
Pure onyx tends to be black, though is not uncommonly found in shades of
white, grey and brown.  It is mostly used for decoration, though it is
supposed to aid in clear thinking and positivity.  Onyx is pretty common,
and is without par in its ability to protect the wearer from hostile
spells.  A more rare variety, sardonyx, which is a deep reddish colour,
is even stronger, and is also useful in honing the intellect of the user.

Onyx is the stone for the month of the Setting, and sardonyx is considered
especially lucky for those born during this time.
~
E
obsidian~
OBSIDIAN
========
Obsidian is simply a form of cooled lava that tends to a glassy black
colour.  Varieties of it include snowflake obsidian, which is weaker and
flawed with small white marks (the \@snowflakes\@), and apache\@s tear, which
is a translucent brown when held up to the light.  It has been used for
centuries as mirrors, and more commonly as blades and arrowheads.

There are many negative connections to this stone, as it is often used in
sacrificial blades, and indeed some of the negative impressions are valid.
While this stone is fairly strong, especially at protecting the user from
magical attack, it is difficult to enchant the gem without causing it to
drain the wearer as well.  Often those who use obsidian talismans are frail
and more prone to sickness.

Obsidian was at one time considered the birthstone for those born during
Lyceonis, but the disfavour this gem has fallen in to caused it to be
replaced by lapis lazuli.
~
E
moonstone~
MOONSTONE
=========
The shimmery gem comes in a variety of colours, though always shines blue
or white.  The most precious (and powerful) moonstones are those of a
nearly colourless white, that shine blue in the light.  Moonstones have
many connections to the spiritual realm, and are often used by sages to
help them remember past lives.

While this stone is weak on its own, when paired with a diamond or sapphire,
it can be quite a powerful tool for the unconscious.  For this reason it is
very popular with spirit scholars, both as jewelry and as a magical aid.

Moonstone is said to bring peaceful sleep and safety, especially to those
out at night, to those born during Kyanamir.
~
E
malachite~
MALACHITE
=========
Malachite is a deep green stone, banded with stripes of dark green or
black.  Most people are already familiar with this gem as it is said to
protect children, especially from sickness and disease.  It is a quite
common decoration on cradles and in childrens jewelry.  It is also
believed to bring patience and reduce tension.

Malachite is quite delicate and breaks easily, and following the Grasie
Rule, it is quite difficult to enchant.

Elanthemir, being a common month for births, hosts this gem as its
birthstone.
~
E
lapis lazuli~
LAPIS LAZULI
============
This stone is a medium, opaque blue, often veined with white, and
sparkles with golden flecks in the light.  It is favoured by royalty,
and is thought to help protect the wearer from evil.  In folklore a
somewhat opposing idea is put forth, that vampires wear this gem to
protect them from the harmful rays of the sun.  Regardless, lapis is
rather weak, best at enchantments that aid the mind.

Lapis lazuli is the birthstone for the month of Lyceonis, and often
worn during times of strife to aid the user in overcoming their
troubles.
~
E
jasper~
JASPER
======
Jasper is a variety of chalcedony that comes in many colours, and is oft
used in beadwork.  It is believed to help vision, both physical sight and
also psychic foresight.  It\@s also thought to protect the wearer against
snake and spider bites.  As an arcane stone, its value is negligible.
~
E
jade~
JADE
====
Commonly ranging from a pale ivory green to a deep moss green, jade can
rarely be found in colours such as white, red, black, and yellow.  The
most rare, and also most mystically powerful type of jade is a milky 
lavender in colour.  Known for encouraging calmness and cool, logical
thought, jade is quite popular in jewelry and small sculpture.  Simply
touching a piece of jade is considered lucky in the southern wastes,
where they believe the stone bestows a blessing on the user.

Jade lends itself to enchantments that boost and aid the intellect, but
it is a fairly powerful focus and will work well with most enchantments.

The wisdom and clarity of the Titan Nelena naturally led jade to be the
birthstone of her month, Nelennamir.
~
E
hematite~
HEMATITE
========
Hematite is a semi-precious gem favoured by warriors and templars.  It is
a deep silvery black that when ground on a polishing wheel, turns the
water cooling it to a dark bloody red.  Kankorans call this gem \#Darrack\#,
and in times past would strap cloth beaded with hematite over wounds in
battle, believing it to staunch blood and give them strength to continue.
The kankoran people are not the only ones to attribute such things to the
stone; many cultures believe the gem to grant the user willpower and
courage.

Hematite holds minor enchantments well, especially those of physical
durability and stamina.  As for more powerful magics, it is not as useful
as many other gems, and requires a skilled caster indeed to evoke
stronger enchantments.

Birthstone of the month of Tyrilis, gifting a child of that month with
hematite jewelry is thought to assure them health and long life.

OPAL
====
Opal is among the most valuable of gems, and is usually found in a 
sparkling white, though it also comes in hues of black, blue, and red 
(fire opal).  It is extremely useful for arcane rituals, and can be quite 
a powerful aid for astral projection.  According to Nefortu lore, opals 
are the singed and melted remains of clouds touched by Bayyal, that then 
fell to the earth.  Regardless of origin, opals tend to be found by the 
water, and must be soaked thoroughly on occasion to keep their shine.

The different shades of opals are useful for different things, though all 
share an affinity for protection magics of some sort.  Blue opals are best 
at protection from harmful magics, and bring luck to travelers on long
voyages, especially across the sea.  Black opals aid the health of the 
wearer, and are among the most powerful to enchant.  Fire opals, those of 
a reddish orange colour, are extremely tricky to enchant as the results 
are difficult to predict, but they have a large amount of potential.
~
E
pearl~
PEARL
=====
Pearls are formed inside shellfish, and are found in various shades of 
white, pink, and black.  Many cultures have independently adopted the 
pearl as a symbol of chastity and purity, and they are common in the 
jewelry of young female nobles.

Pearls are fairly strong, and quite useful at enhancing and extending 
mental capabilities.  Black pearls are especially good at providing 
resistances to various types of magics.

peridot~
PERIDOT
=======
This is a fairly common stone that is found only in a warm, olive green.  
It is thought to help one realize their dreams, and enhance their 
creativity, so it is very popular among artists and writers.  As a magical 
gem, it is fairly simply to enchant with spells to make the user more 
agile and quick, but extremely difficult to enchant it with anything else.

Peridot is the birthstone for the month of Year\@s End.  Wearing it,
especially during this month, is thought to bring optimism and hope to
the user.
~
E
quartz~
QUARTZ
======
Quartz is sometimes unfairly termed the \#poor mans diamond\#, but is 
actually quite useful of its own right.  It helps balance mind and body, 
and is commonly used as a focus for other gems.  Smoky quartz, which is a 
beautiful translucent brown, is without par when enchanted to aid the 
health of the wearer.  Often other gems are used in lieu of smoky quartz 
when such benefits are needed because this variety of quartz is extremely 
rare on this continent.

Some types of quartz occasionally have streaks of golden looking rutile 
within it.  These pieces of quartz are called rutilated quartz, and 
generally occur only in clear and smoky varieties (not the subtypes of 
quartz such as amethyst, citrine, etc).  Smoky rutilated quartz is valued 
highly by healers for its benefits in speeding recovery of the gravely 
ill.

The most valuable of all forms of quartz to the scholar and mage is termed 
\#phantom quartz\#, and has a second (or third, or more) quartz fragment 
grown inside the larger piece.  It is best left unpolished, and can be 
enchanted to bring extensive mental energies to the user when held.
~
E
rose~
ROSE QUARTZ
===========
Rose quartz is, as the name implies, a lovely pink variety of quartz.  It 
is thought to bring emotions to the surface, and when worn with amethyst, 
brings love to the wearer.  It is a tradition in caladaran culture to gift 
someone with a piece of rose quartz if you seek his or her forgiveness in 
some matter.  For obvious reasons, this stone is oft associated with 
Aeolis, and is held sacred by his followers.

A fairly frail and weak gem, it is best at enchantments to aid the user in 
being charming and glib.  Some level of protective magics can be cast upon 
it as well, but it does not excel in any aspect.
~
E
ruby~
RUBY
====
Sometimes referred to as \#the blood of sorcerers\#, ruby is a deep 
transparent red.  It aids in circulation and problems of the blood, and 
revitalizes the user.  Known as a gem of passion, it is a popular 
adornment on wedding bands.  An extremely powerful gem (and second in 
hardness only to diamond), rubies can be enchanted to hold nearly any 
spell.  Above all they are best at extending mental and physical energies.  
Star rubies are highly valued as well, though more for their appearance 
than any particular aid magically speaking.
~
E
sapphire~
SAPPHIRE
========
Sapphires are closely related to rubies and share many of their same 
properties.  While the most famous sapphires are blue, they actually do 
come in a variety of colours, such as yellow, orange, green and pink.  
Sapphires are thought to be a beneficial aid to enhancing psychic 
abilities.

Sapphires are sacred to Jolinn, and for this reason they are a popular 
choice as a tool for channeling water magics.  For any water scholar, the 
sapphire is the gem of choice for any enchantment; for the blessings of 
Jolinn and the strength and flexibility of the gem.
~
E
sunstone~
SUNSTONE
========
It is said until the War of the Night, sunstone was simply a brown variety 
of agate.  But upon the entry of the ch\@taren into the realm, this stone 
began to sparkle and gleam, earning its current name.  Regardless of the 
truth of this story, sunstone is a warm orangish brown in colour with many 
tiny specks of gold that reflect and sparkle in even the dimmest light.  
This stone is sacred to the followers of Rystaia, and is thought to give 
any who wear it courage and positivity in the face of despair.

Sunstone is somewhat uncommon, but is an excellent tool in defending the 
mind against mental attack or intrusion.  It is also fairly useful in 
granting the wearer extended health and psychic energy.

Sunstone is the birthstone for the month of Rystaiamir, and it is thought 
that children who carry sunstone with them will grow up to be good-natured 
and humble.
~
E
tiger tigers eye tigerseye~
TIGER\@S EYE
===========
Tiger\@s eye is a banded brown and black stone, and when tilted in the
light, the colours seem to shift and move.  It can also be found in other
colours which share the same properties as the original stone: Cat\@s Eye
(green), Bull\@s Eye (red), and Hawk\@s Eye (blue).  It is commonly worn as
beads and earrings, and is thought to ground a person, and soften
stubbornness.  As a focus for spells, tiger\@s eye is useful for aiding the 
health of the user, but little else.

The birthstone for the month of the Burning, it is said to gift someone born
during this month with a piece of tiger\@s eye will protect them from the
ill winds of fate (though possibly at the expense of the giver!)
~
E
tourmaline~
TOURMALINE
==========
A rather interesting stone, tourmaline grows in straight rods, rather than 
the usual crystalline formation.  It comes in many hues, most commonly
purple, green, and pink.  While not typically an abundant stone, it can
usually be found in mountains in the warmer areas of Avendar.

Green tourmaline is said to bring balance and peace of heart to men, and
the pink, to women.  It is also quite useful for enchantments that boost
the awareness and agility of the user.
~
E
turquoise~
TURQUOISE
=========
A marbly, somewhat lumpy stone, turquoise gets its name from its bright,
opaque hue.  This stone is oft associated with singers and public
speakers, as it is thought to bring fluidity of speech and to improve
lung capacity.  As it is fairly soft and easy to find, it has been used
in jewelry for many centuries by all manners of people.

It is fairly weak, magically speaking, though just about any culture could
give you a myth or story associated with the gem.  In more recent times,
it is usually enchanted with such things as a bard may request, but the
stone shows no particular affinity with anything.

Turquoise is the stone of the month of Converumir, and when worn on those
summer days, thought to bring protection from danger to the wearer.

{WThe Foolish Manservant{n

There was once a humble youth from a remote forest village.
The youth had a keen mind and an aptitude for observing the
world around him, and was soon noted by all for his wisdom.

He eventually obtained notice even from the prince of the
realm, who journeyed to the remote village to meet the
youth.  The prince found great pleasure in his company,
and made the youth his manservant, which was a great honor
to he and the village.  As they journeyed back to the
prince\@s home, and underwent many a harrowing experience
on their way, a bond of great friendship grew between the
two.

Once at the prince\@s castle, the prince asked the manservant
to take the formal vow of fealty which was generally required
of those who served him.

The manservant replied \#I could not do so, as words promised
before a throne mean less driftwood on the waves, for
hearts change even as the currents that pass within them.\#
He continued, \#Let us mingle instead our souls, a truer bond
between us.\#  And so they each cut their hands, and mingled
the blood, and the prince was satisfied.

[continued]
~
E
tome6~
{WThe Foolish Manservant{n
[continued]

Several years passed, with the manservant always providing
companionship and wise councel to the prince.  Yet there
came a day, when, facing a dangerous dragon, the manservant
slipped from his horse, and as the others attempted to help
him, several of the party were slain, and the prince severely
injured.  Such was the shame of the manservant, who had begun
to taken great pride in his wisdom and his usefulness to the
prince, that he could no longer bear to be in the prince\@s
company.   He feared as well that such incompetence as he had
shown might cause his prince further injury, and so he departed
for his village, sadly reminding the prince that he had never
truly sworn fealty.

Once back at his village, the village elder, who was a holy
man, talked long with the manservant.  Once hearing the
story the manservant told of his time with the prince, he
became incensed.  \#Fool, and twice fool!\# he reprimanded.

\#Oh, I was indeed, the way I fell off that horse!\# replied
the manservant.

The elder sighed sadly.  \#Accidents happen, and I do not

upon yourself to decide to end the bond between you,
and such bonds do not dissolve over accidents, nor do
for stretching them the distance between the castle and our

He who had been a manservant was dismayed, and asked what he
might do.  The elder replied, \#Learn this lesson, at least:
never forsake the trust and love of those who hold you dear.
Such is not easily come by, and should never be discarded.\#

The youth, greatly chastised and penitent, returned to his
prince, and whether he was taken back into the prince\@s
confidence and trust--that is another tale.

To wait and to anticipate your love
After long months or seeming years had passed
Was bitter sweetness, like a mystic trove
Where dazzling, ward-enchanted gems are massed.
I could not touch your hand but in my dream,
Nor see your gentle smile but in my mind,
The ache of missing you a constant theme
Despite the signs that showed our fates aligned.
Together through a spirit-bond of hope
Though distances and sunsets do us part,
The simple magics of the heart are rope
That bind us more than any mystic\@s art.
  I cannot touch my dreams unless with you,
  And so my heart and hopes will remain true.

The tree and the wind
Are sometimes strangers, distant,
Sometimes together.

When spring wind whispers
Over buds, the rustle hums
A new harmony.

In summertime lull,
Leaves cling to slender perches,
Anticipating.

Kyanamir breath
Swirls colors from the branches--
Leaves and wind, one dance

For too-fast moments,

Draw an autumn shawl.

A first leap into air, instinctive faith--
The russet-feathered falcon seeks the wind,
Drawn true to unseen currents, like a wraith
Doom-bound to follow whispers to their end.
The tower-eyrie in the ironwood tree
Is less its home, it knows, than lofty gale--
Each moment in the nest would eons be
Which kept it from the soaring zephyr trail.
And once on wing, what wonders to be seen!
The blue Dantaron snakes across plain,
The canopy of Qilarn mottled green,
The snowy peaks of Brintor\@s high domain.
  With this new view, through clear, far-seeing eyes,
  What must the noble falcon first surmise?

Dawn breaks above the solitary keep,
The cock\@s crow rouses Krilin from its sleep.
A young but valiant soldier, sword in hand,
Strides forth to purge the giants from the land.

He sees a hulking brute across a gulf,
With club in hand, and followed by a wolf.
The soldier leaps the chasm in one bound,
The giant turns and roars, a dreadful sound.

The battle joins with awful howl and yell,
But then the giant cries and breaks the spell!
\#You hit me on the hand!\#
\#Did not!\#
\#Did so!\#
\#Don\@t you tell ma!\#
\#I will, and off I go!\#

And to the keep he runs, tears in his eyes,
His pup in tow, and barking in surprise
To go back home so early in the day--
This soldier rarely quits so soon at play.

In children\@s games we see an echoed life,
A world of pain and fear, a world of strife.
We too seek love and safety\@s warm embrace,
A yearning all our years cannot replace.

In the green bottle
Posed a single question:
To drink or not? I drank
And found no answer--
No sublime secret,
Just the contradictory tang
Of sweet bitterness
My tongue remembers still.
The almond-dark droplets
Burst into creamy bubbles
And ran, like wind-sprites
Before the stormcloud\@s rain,
Leaving sticky-sweet trails
Down the emerald glass
And onto my fingertips.

The first of all our journies
Was without a torch.  
How soon we stumbled,
A slipping, slender lurch
With a tall awkwardness,
Not even to the dim caves
When the moons hid
And the stars were veiled.
Your gentle, goodly grace
(in spirit--if not form)
Drew me along,
A frail-winged moth
Trailing the glimmer-promise
Of your mysterious new light.
Before the week was spent
We watched the morning sky
In Elanthamir\@s chilly splendor.
How far and pale and bleak,
That bright suspended canvas
Painted by the day-dawn,
When I had living light,
A brush of golden fire
At my side.

You have gone ahead,
And I (without a torch)
Will follow when I may.
I look eastward--eastward!
For farewells we said it,
But there are none
When words over stone
Weigh less than the promise
Of long-tried love.
You are in the morning east,
Your brushstrokes lighting
The golden dawn.

This steel shod staff once gave life
The lucent pulse of wounds mended
Vitals struck once, twice
Time to worry
Insecurity, sweat of the mindful

Bolts of ice and wind thrown as spears
My mind is failing, drained
A potion at the ready on my side belt
To quaff such a thing now?
No, my instincts tell me I have a chance

The dance of combat
Strumming loud in the streets
The midday sun now beginning to set
Shadows shifty back into view
A gentle breeze blows from the east

An attempt on my eyes!
What a fool, he has let himself open
The final blast
A fearsome blow
My weapon poised over him

To grant such a thing another chance
One who would offend me again
No, he must learn
In death, release
That will be my mercy

Lealti Ilam began her life in Var Bandor, living with her two scholarly
parents.  As she was an only child, they doted on her with much loving
attention, though their work often kept them away.  When they were gone, she
practiced music and joined a singing group of children roughly her age. 
Though she was the only ethron in the group, she was well-accepted among
them, for she was very polite and had an excellent singing voice. 
All-in-all, her childhood was happy, which will surely have a bearing on her
throughout her life.

As an adolescent, she became more curious about the world, often asking
her parents odd questions.  From their descriptions, she learned that the
world was both dangerous and beautiful.  Tired of being pestered, her
parents offered her to attend the bardic guild in the city, where she would
be able to pursue her musical career and her curiosity.  She gladly
accepted, heart lit with the idea of praising the beauty that might be found
in the world.

card stiff embellished vellum~
This stiff vellum card is a bright, clean white.  A trellis of bright
flowers has been illuminated about its edges in bright reds, vivid greens,
and royal blues, all picked at and highlighted with touches of gold.  
A poem is written in the center of the card in neat, slanting script:

        {WWomen of Avendar{n
           by Anbesel

I do not know what Jolinn\@s seen,
An ethron\@s skin is much too green.
Though she be busty, fair and lean,
I do not like that verdant glean.

And if indeed I had the gall,
I\@d say an alath\@s much too tall,
And, as well, her brain\@s too small,
Her looks, they matter not at all.

Though their bodies may be tight,
Nefortu women are too slight,
And their faces are a fright,
Both in the day and in the night.

And it may come as no surprise,
Shuddeni with their absent eyes,
Sickly skin and wrinkled guise,
I feel in them no beauty lies.

Srryn women with their tails,
Jagged teeth and sharpened nails,
Lack of hair and wealth of scales,
Prove that sometimes nature fails.

Though aelin women oft have grace,
With pretty wings and pretty face,
To seek her favor brings disgrace,
Too proud, she\@ll put you in your place.

With fur and fangs and fearsome growl,
Kankoran women make me scowl,
Because when wet they smell quite foul,
And because they often howl.

A caladaran\@s not my fate,
I do not even hesitate.
Their bark-like skin I do equate
With things I want not in my mate.

A ch\@taren may be fair,
Yet be substantial as the air,
To be with one takes too much care,
Trying to kiss what\@s barely there.

But there is one in all the land,
Who I indeed let take my hand.
At last I think you understand,
A human lass I do demand.

variety of useful words and phrases, including their counterparts
in any number of spoken and written tongues.  This first version
will include the following languages: {Wcommon, ch\@taren, aelin,
kankoran, arcane {nand ancient {Walatharya{n.  Depending on its success,
it is to be hoped that further editions will follow, including more
words to be translated into even more languages.

Curator Zielistala, and Rskomar Kharos.  Without you, this

Introduction

In addition to having different words, verbs are conjugated
differently in each tongue.  It would be impractical to explain
how each verb conjugates, but I will do my best to indicate
irregular verbs with a *.  For further information on conjugating
verbs, students should seek out a linguist or native speaker.

This is the third edition of the Gaald Library\@s Multilingual
Translation Reference - a preliminary attempt to catalogue a
variety of useful words and phrases, including their counterparts
in any number of spoken and written tongues.  This first version
will include the following languages: {Wcommon, ch\@taren, aelin,
kankoran, arcane {nand ancient {Walatharya{n.  Depending on its success,
it is to be hoped that further editions will follow, including more
words to be translated into even more languages.

I\@d like to offer special thanks to Linguist Chinda,
Curator Zielistala, and Rskomar Kharos.  Without you, this

AND so they left the Caverns through secret, newly-tunneled routes and in
a single night came on demon-back and demon-wing to Ad\@masteisa, where the
unprepared folk could mount little resistance before they fell.  However,
the shuddeni soon learned that their spies had greatly exaggerated the depth
and extend of tunnels into Rimora.  As the old allies of light banded
together again and made their way through the broken lands to Ad\@masteisa,
the shuddeni forces scattered, abandoning the ruins of the haven and fleeing
back to the darkness of their deepest ancestral caverns.  

THE remaining havens are little like the cities of other mortals.   After
the destruction of Ad\@masteisa, each raised towers (called sy\@ceera) to
detect void magics and provide the first defense against them.  Also,
the citizenry is highly transient--the dwellings empty and fill as the
ch\@taren come and go, following their carefree and wandering lifestyle.
Few ch\@taren reside in the city permanently, though the elderly are more
apt to settle than ch\@taren youth, and provide the stability and leadership
needed in any society. A few goodly folk of other races have been allowed
to settle in the havens, and their numbers have slowly grown over the years
significantly adding to the stability of the haven societies.

MOST ch\@taren trained in the templar arts will, at some point during their
residence in a haven, volunteer to serve as a Warder.  The Warders make up
an informal watch, providing a measure of security to ch\@taren and
non-ch\@taren inhabitants against mischief. A select group of Warders (again,
often the more elderly) in each haven make up the elect group known as
Spiritlords.  The Spiritlords see to the defense of the haven, man the
sy\@ceera, and safeguard the oldest surviving ch\@taren relics and lore.

THE first was the haven of the waves.  On the remote island of Alensha, a
city with walls of white marble streaked with ch\@lonin was created.  It came
to be known as Jh\@ten.  Water scholars fashioned an amazing aqueduct system
in the city which still has no equal.  The second was the haven of the ice. 
In the far north, the settlement of Avayn was established, carved from the
base of a mighty glacier and protected from the chill of ice by water
scholars.  It remains the most purely ch\@taren of all places in Avendar, and
is the repository of most relics and artifacts from the ch\@taren homeworld. 
The third was the haven of the wind.  In the Broken Lands to the far east of
Earendam, Ad\@masteisa, a city of ch\@lonin- streaked terraces and graceful
ledge dwellings, was fashioned from the stone of a mountain face.  

THERE were rumors of a fourth haven as well, a hidden haven where the
greatest artifacts of the ch\@taren plane were secreted (though this is
generally denied by the Spiritlords, and has remained undiscovered, if it
actually exists).  

ONLY a decade had passed after the construction of the havens when the
shuddeni raised a final insurgence, seeking to break from the Thrandir
Caverns where they had been cornered.  The shuddeni warmasters had,
through nefortu spies, learned of the Havens and determined to claim
Ad\@masteisa, the cliff-city, as the rumors of tunnels into mount Rimora
made it a promising shuddeni stronghold.
~
E
tome2~
AFTER the final of the great campaigns of the War of Night, when the
shuddeni had at last been driven back into the deepest recesses of the
under-earth, the ch\@taren and their allies came to realize a basic fact:
the ch\@taren were homeless in Avendar.  During the conflict, they had
stayed with and battled side by side with their human, aelin, ethron,
and  caladaran allies, but when the conflict ended this arrangement
seemed likewise to need an end--for even the greatest guests are likely
to eventually outwear their welcomes.

THIS was not an immediate concern for the ch\@taren themselves, as they
felt little inclination to settle.  Why this is so is a subject of debate,
for they remembered well the great cities built with the Art of Availlae
in their home plane.  But in Avendar, the homing instinct, the need to claim
territory and raise permanent shelters, was weaker within them, as was the
Art of Availlae itself.  In the weeks immediately after the Battle of the
Thrandir Caves, with the shuddeni threat seeming ended, the ch\@taren
gradually dispersed.  Travelling alone or in friend or kin groups, the
ch\@taren adopted a wandering lifestyle and spread throughout the land.

AFTER a few short years of wandering, however, the elders and sages among
the ch\@taren began to see a need for places of gathering, places where
ch\@taren could go for refuge and safety when necessary, places where
ch\@taren could meet with ch\@taren to bear and raise a new generation.
Also needed were places where the remaining lore, relics, and artifacts
from their homeworld could be stored and safeguarded.  And so, with
consultation from their allies of the war, particularly the great archmagi
of water with whom they had been allied so closely during the war, three
places were chosen, which came to be known as the Three Havens.  Using
what little of the Art of Availlae that they could draw upon in this plane,
and being supported by the native water and earth magi in their workings,
the ch\@taren made their havens.

And so the exercise of free will through actions made, decisions taken,
beliefs held, characteristics manifest, and words spoken, may not represent a
perfect balance in and of themselves, yet should, upon reflection, be held
against all deeds, decisions, beliefs, characteristics, and words.  The sum
of all should be a return to neutrality.

This in turn leads to the fact that the older one becomes, the less, comparatively,
each deed influences the personal measure. Those of very advanced age may find it
impossible to balance a life lived at the extremes.  On the other hand, those who
in youth are disadvantaged in considering personal balance, in that their deeds
impact their whole measure significantly. My experience leads me to believe that
it is chiefly in the summer and autumn of life that one may most effectively pursue
and attain a high measure of personal balance.  If attained, it can then be honed
in small degree to an even greater equilibrium in the winter of life.

Few if any mortals can achieve such a mastery of will that the sum of their lives
results in a total perfection of neutrality.  Yet it is in following a life that
aspires to such, that those whose souls are bound to the altars of neutrality will
find greatest fulfillment.

~

scroll5~
Inner balance is only partially dictated, however, by concerns of corporeal
form, unless one considers the void-dominated nature of shuddeni, and the
spirit-dominated nature of ch\@taren.  Both are incapable of achieving a true
inner balance. But for most races, as expressed earlier, it is free will
itself that may guide one, over time and through experience, to a balanced
life, despite the natural corporeal influence.  The will of Grujnah led him
to become Thales-yet the will of others has just as often led to greater
imbalance, as the will is enticed by the dreams of security and peace of
light or the greed for the depraved power of dark.

Disciples of true neutrality, in seeking inner balance, will therefore do
as Thales did-seek a proper perspective through consideration, reflection,
and reasoning.  Thales had thirty years to argue his precepts before the wisest
sages of Avendar, but mortals do not have such time.  Among the Knights of
Enaerai, a need was recognized for a time to step back from the concerns of
daily life, important as they may be, and reflect on matters of personal balance
among other things), and so Mettenday, the first calendar day of each month,
became a holy day among them.

In one\@s reflections and considerations of balance, the individual must
consider how acts or other expressions of free will can be measured against
other acts.  Recall an over-arching principle of all aspects of balance, which
I term {WTalkymir\@s Maxim{n: \#Balance is not the absence of extremes, but rather
their equilibrium\#.  And so it is with inner balance, applied to the
characteristics of the individual.  There are always opposing forces, but
it is their equilibrium which brings one into the proper measure. Looking at
particular characteristic, a particular personality flaw or feature, or
considering the deeds of a Knight on a particular day may give one a skewed
vision of that Knight\@s personal balance, and there are many who consider the
knights in the light of particular circumstance and pass quick and ignorant
judgment about inner balance.  But it is his or her being as a whole, based
the elemental foundation of the body, actuated through the will and manifest
through word and deed over the course of a life--all the whole form the inner
balance of a soul.
~
E
scroll4~
How Grujnah-Thales, a being imbued with divine power, could change due
to intellect and will is a significant example of the effect of will
and reason.  How much greater the effect on beings so weak (comparatively
speaking) as mortals.  Thales becomes a prime example to all who seek
wisdom and purpose, both in his willingness to reflect and debate the ways
and walks of life, and in his ultimately following the surest path.

ACHIEVING INNER BALANCE

How do we mortals then achieve an inner balance?  This question is,
ironically, more pertinent to the followers of neutrality, than to those
who align themselves with the extreme opposing forces.  Those who shun
balance in all its aspects will have no use for the concept of inner
balance, and such individuals stand against each other in the measures of
deeper balance, an aspect which will be written of in other works.

According to the principle of omnipresent measure, everything that exists
is imbued with some innate degree or combination of the many opposing
forces.  Take, for example, a simple stone.  Being of the element of
earth, it possesses characteristics of stability (order, or law) in
abundance.  A gust of air, of course, stands opposed, with its chaotic
and wild nature.  In all things that exist these connections to opposing
forces are found in varying degrees.

Our mortal bodies, too, are composed of the raw elemental materials in
such a way that they have balance and reach equilibrium, allowing the
spirit of life to dwell within.  It is to be noted, however, that the
elemental equilibrium of bodily form is not the same in all races.  
A nefortu may have a preponderance of air, it is said, while the srryn
have a preponderance of fire, and so forth. It has been argued that
aelins, and even moreso, humans, are the most balanced races in terms of
raw elemental forces which form them, and that this accounts for the great
diversity in how the opposing forces are manifest through their actions,
and the consequent impact on other aspects of balance.

         {WTHE INNER BALANCE, OR BALANCE OF THE SOUL{n
                    by Garrode Delende

Inner balance is, in essence, a personal equilibrium, the measure
of balance within an individual. It is commonly said that those who
are mentally unstable are \#unbalanced\#, but this is a misleading
expression.  Inner balance is directly not correlated to standard
mental functioning (though of course it would no doubt be affected
by such).  Inner balance does have primarily to do with the possession
of intellect, and even moreso, with the greatest gift and curse the
Gods have given mortals: free will.

The ability of the mind to reason, to extrapolate based on condition,
is powerful, even in those of minor intellect.  Action based on thought,
feeling, or instinct while influenced by environment and countless other
factors and forces, is at the ultimate root of threats to balance in any
of its aspects.  With inner balance, however, this is especially the case,
because the scope is limited to the individual.

In a long-ago era age now lost to legend, the greatest sages and wisest
lore-masters of old once strove against a corrupt demigod named Grujnah.
How and why the conflict between Grujnah and the sages arose is unclear,
lost in the mists of time.  Yet to this day, one can see in the Hall of
Pillars the relief depicting the great philosophical debate between them.
It is recorded that the debate lasted thirty years, and only ended when
the demigod at last admitted the flaws in his reasoning.  From thereafter
Grujnah became known as Thales, and took a place among the Lords of Balance.

~
E
scroll2~
So it is when searching for a deeper understanding of the principles
of balance. One must first understand that the concept of balance is
multifaceted before one can understand the principles at play. One must
not let semantic vagaries or the inadequacy of the common lexicon hinder
a full understanding and appreciation of the ways of balance.

To that end, I propose the following framework for considerations of the
primary aspects of balance:

 1) {RThales{n: The Inner Balance, or Balance of the Soul
 2) {WEnaerai{n: The Faction Balance, or the Balance of Works
 3) {BKelaith{n: The World Balance, or Balance of Avendar
 4) {yChadraln{n: The Universal Balance, or Balance of All

In this writing, a scroll is devoted to each aspect.  Each is defined
in terms of historical development and current weighting, as well as 
basic underpinning principles.  I have associated each with a particular
deity of balance, in addition, to help identify and illustrate its nature.

Experienced philosophers of balance may argue that this framework, useful
as it may prove, is still limited.  Indeed it is. It may, however, serve
as a beginning point for novices in their study of balance, allowing them
a ready approach for their research into the of neutrality scholarship.

This slate-grey scroll, made from tough, clothlike paper, is covered with
silvery ink in a neat script.

The top of the scroll reads:

                 {WASPECTS OF BALANCE: INTRODUCTION{n
                       by Garrod Delende

What is the balance?  There are many views on the nature of 
balance, and over the centuries, many have disputed and even entered
into armed conflict over the principals of the true measure.  Why is
this the case?


One of the biggest reasons for this confusion is the inability to 
recognize one very important fact:  the concept of balance encompasses
many things.  Many who have argued over balance are really arguing over
separate and distinct matters.   The word \#balance\# is widely and generally
applied in many areas, not all of which overlap.

Imagine two scholars debating whether the concept of color is best seen
in that which is red or that which is blue.  Or imagine two sages 
disputing whether oak, elm or pine best represents the notion of \#tree\#.
Such debates are, of course, pointless.  Our notion of color encompasses
both the red and the blue, as well as the myriad other hues  and shades
and tones. The simplest of woodsmen would easily observe that oak, elm,
pine and countless other species are all trees.

{WKor Thrandir{n
Similarly, the guardsmen of Kor Thrandir are well-prepared, 
their resolve hardened in defense of the shuddeni over 
generations.  Both stationed at sentry posts, as well as 
on patrol, the soldiery of Kor Thrandir is an inescapable 
and constant presence.  This vigilance is unflagging, and 
made possible by the ranks of archers that patrol the
battlements of the city\@s tower.  As a consequence, 
criminal behaviour is kept to a minimum.   According to 
the shopkeepers, elite soldiers will come to their aide 
after a few sharp shouts.

For the most, it appears that the guard of Kor Thrandir 
is divided evenly amongst infantrymen and archers.  
Captain Aeglin provides instruction on the intricacies of
the bow, while Lieutenant Commander Velitius oversees the 
training of the soldiers.  In spite of their obvious 
differences, both archers and infantry train relentlessly,
taking advantage of the vast training fields within the 
city walls to hone their skills.

Under the guidance of Major Chartoff, a water templar of 
some notoriety, soldiers are trained in a variety of 
weapons, including the mace, staff, pike, and sword, as 
wooden replicas.

Instruction is governed through an internal hierarchy.  Lieutenant
Retli serves as the right hand of the Baron, and the effective
commander of the Fort\@s men-at-arms.

A combination of tactics have been employed historically to hold
the line against the marauding giants that inhabit the Brintors.
In addition to infrantrymen and guards, the Fortress utilizes 
strategically positioned archers to bolster defenses.

The sergeants are trained in a variety of offensive tactics,
though are frequently poorly-equipped due to depleted resources
-- a by-product of the bounty on giant scalps.  Despite their
limited arms, they are capable of holding their own, utilizing
a combination of brute force and finesse.  As such, they are able
adversaries.

In Earendam, the soldiers are divided into guardsmen and 
watchmen.  The former are stationed at the four gates of 
the city, while the latter are given leave to patrol the

Earendam, and carry shields emblazoned with the city\@s 
crest.  The gate guards are outfitted with long pikes, 
while the watchmen, more likely to be called upon to 
chase down criminals, favour the lighter sword.

Yet whoever shall presume to obtain the height of this art, according
to our most secret ways without the observing and understanding
of Urbergeron, will certainly find himself mightily mistaken at
last, having after a great deal of troubles, charges, and pains,
reaped nothing but discontent and on the contrary they, that shall
walk in our true and infallible lore, shall with very little trouble
and expenses attain to their desired end, which we cordially wish
to all those who are sincere well-wishers to the alchemic philosophy.
But the true student looks beyond the base element to see all other
aspects and virtue, vice and design which touch the foundation of
property. These number many, are known to none but the minds of
those who command the ancient by will, and of their influence
are as lasting as the nine.

And there is Alteration for Enhancement.
And there is Detection from Beguilement. 
And there is Travel in the bounds of the Planar.
And there is Healing of Damage.
And there is Benediction against Malediction. 
And there is Revelation from Obscurement. 
And there is Chaos against Order. 
And there is Protection against Weather. 
And there is Knowledge from Mental. 
And there is Summoning for Conjuration. 
And there is Breath of Time.

And these in aspect shape the making even as the element stands at the crux
of essence to bring about what the hands of the philosopher shall fashion.
And this work of the essence from its very beginning to its perfect end may,
on our certain knowledge, be perfected by any skillful and careful artist,
that knows the lore of Urbergeron, unless some accident should happen in
the preparation of our great works: which to prevent, we wrought them with
care, and for better effect in a place of sufficient design and material
which is most agreeable to the practice of the wisest of philosophers.

Although some students of the art, possessed with foolish notions,
dream that the first matter is to be found only in some particular
places, at such and such times of the year yet we are most 
certain (according to our master Urbergeron) that, all these
suppositions being false, it is to be found everywhere, at all
times and only by our lore and its application. For in the vision 
of Urbergeron, he saw an empty void of shadow, seperated from
the not-void only by a halo of spirit.

Then came powers, of the Ancient to Transmogrify, and it so was
wrought according to the will, between shadow and light, the 
fundaments of Earth, Fire, Water, and Air (which, with life begun 
in Spirit and gnawed to consumption by Void, are Nature). And the 
powers utilized and wrought our essence first, essence of element, 
essence of truest being, with which all things resonate in degree 
according to their very material stuff and according to the shaping 
of type. And so there are nine, and nine is the chief and most 
foremost number in the lore of he who would know. He who sees, of 
the study and teaching of Urbergeron, can sense their influence in 
all.

{WThe Advisings of Elchin, Disciple of Urbergeron{n

Now I do not wonder, as I did before, why philosophers of the art,
having attained knowledge by experience in full, have not cared to
have their days shortened (although by the virtue of their work they
could have prolonged them) for every true philosopher has all so
clearly set before his eyes, as your face is seen in a glass. Thus
much by way of reply to the frivolous objections of those that
believe not the verity of this art, who hold word and gesture
to be superior to substance. If you should discover to them the 
process of the common alchemic stone, let alone that great prize
long sought by many, they would laugh at your simplicity, and I
will warrant you never make use of it. Nay, if you should make
projection before them, they would think that even in that there
was a fallacy, so wedded to the scholarship of unbelief are they.
So I find them, and so I leave them, and shall forever find 
them the same.

These nine combine to weave the fabric and life of the mortal plane. 
There may be found trace amounts of each of these substances in any given
material, but the extraction of the primary element of a source is most
useful and important.  It is the task of the expert alchemist to pick apart
these primary weaves of magic and reform them, melding them into a more
useful product.  

Modern scholars seek to call energy from the six prime planes, controlling
their weaves through inflection of voice and tone of command, using a
vocabulary discovered after the Sundering.  The method of the alchemist has
distinct advantages over such short-term and singular use of the elements,
as all material necessary for our work lies here on the material plane,
waiting to be reshaped to our need.  Instead of calling the weaves directly
from an elemental plane, we use the permanence of material to bind our
weaves up into fluid, matter, and oil.  

Once a master of the Eye can discern where materials fall on the Inner
Circle, he can understand the paths that are possible through the Outer. 
For instance, as a sword has already been forged with the purpose to harm,
it shall be easier to reform its flows into a spell which does harm in its
own right.  The magic running through a shield meant to protect can be most
easily manipulated into a brew of protection.  It is upon these nuances that
I shall focus the training required for my admission to the twenty-second
rank of our guild.

To the aspiring novice of alchemy, little is of greater concern than the
interplay and partitioning of the nine elements of Avendar.  A solid footing
within this inner circle is crucial before one can hope to choose his path
through the outer. 
  
Take heed of the properties of the various elements:
  
-Earth{n, source of order and strength.
-Air{n, force of chaos that wears down the highest mountains.
-Fire{n, which consumes and destroys.
-Water{n, sustenance of life present in all flesh
-Spirit{n, conduit between soul and body
-Void{n, element of darkness and death
-The Ancient{n and scarce magic of those that lived before the Sundering
-Nature{n, the unruly force of growth and beginning
-And Change{n, the transmogrification of one body into another

{WChapter Three: Black Swells- The Result of Ripple Interference.{n

There have occasionally been reports of aberrant results to rituals and
spells involving the void.  While many are the results of inept handling of
compenents or mispronounciation of an incantation, several incidents can not
be so simply explained away.  It is believed that when several powerful
ripples meet, it can cause a turbulance of sorts within the void, to
oft-unpleasant results.  Many cases of mispossesion and missummonings have
been credited to such.  Incidents of void scholars being stuck within the
other body and negation of personality are discussed in length in a treatise
by one of my contemperaries, Rzkakiz.

Missummonings are noteably less common, but usually more dramatic.  Jyraka,
a high wizard of the Yithoul tribe, reportedly attempted to summon a runaway
slave back to the temple.  Despite a reportedly flawless circle, the spell
went awry.  The result was the chaja being summoned into her body, the two
merging into a formless mass.  The resulting dissection showed the bodies
had indeed fused.  At the time, no less than 3 nexuses had been opened
around the cavern.

The chapter continues, giving many more gruesome examples of failed
summonings.
~
E
book2~
{WChapter Two: Demonic Resonance- Could Demonic Summoning be Refined?{n

It is theorized that certain ripples resonate with the inhabitants of the
void.  The incantation sends out a ripple that beckons demons to enter this
realm.  The apparent randomness of demonic summoning suggests that these
demons are all clustered approximately the same distance away from the veil.
One wonders what may lie beyond the simple demons we now call.  Perhaps if
were able to somehow delay the effects of the ripples, or make them
undetectable to certain beings within the Void, we could find greater powers
to bind and call forces with more accuracy.

The summoning of Greater Demons is perhaps an example of this.  Have we
incidentally hit upon a way to slip the resonating ripples past the weaker
powers of the void?  If we have, how deep do we penetrate?  Are we ignoring
other demons between the lesser and the greater?  Many questions are raised.
With the refining of the summoning process, answers might be found.

The chapter continues, giving forth proposals to streamline the summoning
process.

This thin book, bound with black leather and fastened with iron was
authored by the shuddeni void scholar and theorist Tkaigan.  The thin pages
are an aged, yellow parchment.  

{WChapter One: The Dark Pond- The Void Ripple Theory.{n

It has been surmised that the channeling of the void for the purpose of
casting creates ripples within the space of the void.  While many of the
lesser castings, simple maledictions and calls for knowledge, cause
insignificant disturbances, other more powerful incantations create
noticable ripples.

For the most part, these ripples have little effect upon our craft.  It
raises interesting possibilities, however.  If this proves true, it may
allow for the detection of other spells cast by fellow void scholars.  Some
have said that the true reason for the harmful effects of the spells of
\@gate\@, \@nexus\@ and \@phase door\@ are due to the disturbance caused by the
ripples of the casting.  I suspect this to be untrue, however.  The effects
of remaining within the void upon living matter would most likely be
detrimental.  There have been reports of people cast into the void while
under magical observation.  The subjects were reported to suffer no ill
physical results, but began to gibber madly.  They soon began to repeat some
incomprehensible phrase in desperation before they were apparently unmade. 
The claim that no physical harm was incurred is interesting.  Perhaps
survival within the Void would be possible, if the mental degeneration could
be avoided.

The chapter continues, putting forth ideas on survival within the void.

{WChapter Six:  The Scribe\@s Epilogue{n
-----------------------------------
  Only a few of the many parchments containing the short, but rich history
of Caal survived the hand of Ssanthal. Nothing is known of what happened
to the child Riia after her escape from the desctruction, but, theories 
abound. Many suspect it was she who was amongst the original few who
learned the magics of the water directly from the Titans, and later 
exacted her revenge on Ssanthal for the slaying of her family. Others 
suspect she may have intertwined the line of Caal with that of the later
empires of Fahn and Gaald. Many bloodlines claim that they are direct descendants of
the Lady Riia, though such cannot be proven.

{WChapter Five:  The Fifth Generation{n
-----------------------------------
  The fifth generation would spell the end of the bloodline of Caal. 
The War of Fire, which ravaged and decimated most of Avendar, did serve,
under the guise of the srryn fire templar Ssanthal, Fire Brand of Sythys,
whose magic burned the mighty empire of Caal to the ground. All of the
line of Caal who lived therein were ruthlessly slaughtered, save the eldest
child of Tourin, Riia, who was miraculously saved from the inferno. The 
majestic battlements, tall spires, and monolithic castles of the proud
Kingdom of Caal, all were consumed by the fire.

{WChapter Four:  The Fourth Generation{n
------------------------------------
  Prince Tourin grew, in his youth, to be reknown as the greatest warrior
in Caal\@s ranks. At a young age, his mind was forever pondering strategies,
and his body training for battle. He quickly rose in the ranks of the
Caal military, being annointed a general by his 18th year. His brother
and his caladaran wife Cailisska on the other hand, fell victim to a 
plague which attacked Caal at that time.  As his father and brothers aged,
he was coronated King of a united Caal. Jaefe Tullia, the queen, bore 
two daughters and three sons to the line, shortly before the great inferno
bore down on Avendar, leaving only ash in its wake.

{WChapter Three  The Third Generation{n
-----------------------------------
  Three sons were born to the line, Trarfrid, Xance, and Glaren. Prior to
King Indar\@s death, he divided Caal into three nations, each ruled 
by one of his sons. For whatever reasons, the history and descendents
of Trarfrid and Xance were not written down. Glaren, on the other hand,
and his wife, Finae Gwyddyth, had two sons, Tourin and Brakan. 
  In spite of the split in the power of Caal, the rules of these three
brothers were uneventful. They concentrated less on territorial expansion,
and more on the advancement of their armies.

{WChapter Two:  The Second Generation{n
-----------------------------------
  Born in King Haerdoth\@s 41st year, the twins Siri and Indar Caal brought
a sense of lasting to the empire that the great Haerdoth had so quickly
built. Years passed, and Haerdoth lived to see 18 more years of his empire
flourishing, before his death. Queen Siya lived only a year longer than he,
and that year, spent stricken with grief.
  After a great period of sadness for the Kingdom of Caal, Indar assumed
the throne left empty by his father. After marrying Synove Issar, of whom
nothing is known, save her name, he proceeded to expand the land in the
name of Caal northward, claiming parts of the Brintor mountains, and 
westward, to the Arein Plains.  Little is known of the events in 
his sister Siri\@s life, save that she married Wathar Schin, and bore a
daughter to him, Pala Schin.

but 120 years prior to the War of Fire. The son of a sailor from a
small fishing village at the northwestern corner of the frigid, gray  
Uthlin, whose name still remains buried in time. Mightly blood, as if
from some divine creature coursed through his veins. He was known far 
and wide as one of the greatest warriors to ever grace Avendar. Little
else is known of his life, until his 25th year. Here, the scrolls of Caal
begin their accounts of his efforts to create the Kingdom of Caal. A 
mighty sovereignty that stretched from the northern shores of whence he
came over the vast grasslands to the west, a massive, well-trained army
defending its walls. In a span of 15 years, he united thousands, 
creating in a short time, a mighty empire known throughout Avendar.
  In Haerdoth Caal\@s 40th year, the Lady Siya Kijan, daughter of a wealthy
merchant, became queen, ushering in a sense of nationalism and faith in 
the Crown of Caal, with the births of their son and daughter.

Kjolarnkos tiredly parried the vicious swing, hooking his sword-arm out to
the right.  This was a losing battle, and he knew it.  If only the sentries
had not been so worn out from the day\@s journey, if only he had not taken
their place for the night.  But there was little else to do - fleeing would
mean death, to his tribe and the natural balance.  So instead he continued
his fight, pulling through his offhand to break the impetus of this snarling
beast\@s offensive.  He was fighting purely on the defensive, a tactic that
can only delay death until he made a mistake, which grew more likely as he
grew more tired.  The srryn feinted suddenly, a maneuver for which
Kjolarnkos was prepared.  He moved to deflect the anticipated attack, but
was suddenly shocked by the spurt of blood that sprayed upwards from his
side.  The realization that it was indeed his blood did not come until he
crumpled to the ground.

Kelrisa hissed in satisfaction, advancing on the fallen pack leader. 
\#Thisss isss your time.\#  He huffed a bit of smoke from his flaring
nostrils, staring down in the dark wolflike eyes that had begun to slowly
glaze over.  The burning sword crackled furiously as he lifted it high.  And
fell away, as a snarling mass of fur and fury rammed him.  Jorros was almost
thrown back by the sheer force of the tackle against the powerful saurian,
but kept his footing long enough to avoid the vicious swipe originally
intended for Kjolarnkos.  The fire user hissed in frustration, and a sudden
bolt of flame arced from his finger to Jorros, who screamed in pain as the
blaze wreathed his lithe frame.  But as he fell back and the fire-wielder
stood over him, Kjolarnkos\@s arm shot out, pulling the enemy down and
driving his own weapon through him.  Writhing in agony, Kelrise let out a
horrendous bestial roar, then lay still.

A flashing blade, {Wthere{n, coming at his head.  Jadoch ducked swiftly
but lost balance and tumbled forward to sprawl at his enemies feet.  Howling
with triumph, the barbaric human who towered over him raised his axe high. 
Jadoch\@s left arm sprang out quickly, catching his opponents leg and jerking
swiftly.  THUD.  The massive axe bit deeply into the dirt just beside the
prostrate kankoran.  Rolling up and onto his haunches, Jadoch kicked his
body forward and away from the enraged human.  In his mind, all the scenes
merged together into a massive horrific haze.  The clang of weapons being
parried, the clanking or thudding sound as metal and wooden shields turned
blows, and all about the omnipresent crackle of the raging blaze.  He saw
some of his pack fall, though not without dealing like retribution to the
assailants.  

He watched, even as he fought, and caught of glimpse of Jorros, his brother,
as he swept the legs of one of the enemy from under him.  His darting eyes
captured a scene of Tacharkal, the adopted of his den, as he howled in the
heat of battle, finishing his enemy.  Yet despite these small victories, ,
the battle was not going well.  Though the numbers had from the outset been
about evenly matched, the Kanyk\@lakir had been taken by surprise as they
fled the flames that even now filled the clearing with heat and smoke.  Yet
through the dark billowing clouds of miniscule carbon particles, Jadoch
could see the source of the fire, a massive srryn wielding a flaming sword
and burning whip.  Locked in deadly combat with this one was their own
leader, Kjolarnkos, who certainly seemed the worse for the wear.  Though he
stood a clear head taller than his enemy, his energy had become weariness
next to the terrible fury of the saurian.  Kelrisa.  The name flashed
through Jadoch\@s mind.  It could be no other.  And his Followers, the
bringers of imbalance and disunion.  
~
E

Tacharkal snuffed softly, still gazing at the blaze.  How had they been able
to do such a thing, that left the land so scarred and unbalanced?

Run.  The command pounded through his head, demanding in its urgency.  Run. 
Jadoch\@s mind spun as he tried to make sense of the chaos about him.  Run. 
Where were they?  Run.  He ran.  Sprinting through flaming brambles,
avoiding blazing limbs as they sought his head to land upon, he ran.  He ran
as his heart commanded, as fast as his young legs would allow.  There.  Up
ahead, the clearing.  A falling tree nearly crushed him, but he dodge it and
moved on.  Here.  He had made it.  Jadoch burst from the blazing forest, his
chest heaving as he gulped in air.  His vision cleared abruptly at the sound
of ferocious battle.  Fighting there before him were those of his tribe,
ambushed.  He recognized the enemies from the legends and tales, though he
had never seen them.  The Followers of Kelrisa.

He shook his head, fearful to venture further into the dangerous depths of
such volatile memory.  But it came nonetheless, overpowering his senses,
filling his mind with fire and darkness...
~

Tacharkal tossed another log onto the fire, and it sputtered angrily in
response.  He drew back and sat on the ground, glancing over at Jadoch.  The
latter was again looking beyond the flames, falling back into yet another
recollection.  Tacharkal nodded to himself, empathetic.  Jorros had been
like a brother to him, too.  He slipped into a reverie of his own.

This memory was of a different sort than Jadoch, for it was imagined rather
than real.  Tacharkal had been far too young to remember when Kjolarnkos had
found him, alone and presumably left for dead on the snowy ground of the
forest.  Perhaps he had been an oversight of some birthing den, an
overly-inquisitive pup who had managed to sneak out.  Perhaps his parents
had been killed.  He did not know.  Nor was he aware of what foresight or
wisdom has prompted their leader to bring the pup to the elder Talykmir. 
But then his memories faded into truth, as he recollected the times the
three had spent together - Jadoch and Jorros Talykmir and himself, the
newest member to the family.  Though Jorros was older than Jadoch and
Tacharkal - who were about the same age - he proved an excellent companion
and friend, often helping them to understand the ways of the pack, and why
they were different.  Led by Kjolarnkos, the Kanyk\@lakir followed the
teachings of the original Kanyk\@lakir.  To all things there was balance, and
harmony, and if this is not upheld, the world was endangered.  Jorros had
believed this with the force of a zealot.

Run.  Branches crashed about him, their accustomed green now glowing
lividly with an infernal red.  Run.  He whipped his head around,
smoke-filled eyes tearing up.  Run.  Where were they?  Run.  

Jadoch rolled over backwards, away from the campfire.  His heart threatened
to beat through his chest.  It was over.  Only a memory.  Only a memory? 
Only a memory.  Relax.  A sound on his left startled him, but Tacharkal\@s
deep growl soothed him He had brought more firewood.  Their eyes met in
understanding for a moment, then both looked away.  It was much lonelier
without Jorros.  

Jorros tackled him unexpectantly, throwing him off-balance.  Yelping with
laughter, both pups rolled around the forest floor, wrestling playfully. 
These were the best times, when the training was no over, before the stories
of Great Kanyk\@lakir were told around to the young ones.  Kanyk\@lakir, the
Revered One.  Even as he lay panting happily from the struggle, Jadoch could
see Kjolarnkos\@s huge mouth moving, hear as the massive kankoran related the
stories of his own direct ancestor, the Ancient One.  Kanyk\@lakir, who had
first seen the day turn to night, the night turn to day, the cold become
warm and the warm become cold, and realize the inherent balance of this way.
The change of the seasons, the height of the mountains and the depth of the
vale, the old who died and made way for new youth.  This was the way of
things, the Great One had realized.  

Snapping out of his reverie, Jadoch rolled out the way just barely fast
enough to avoid another playful tackle from his older brother.  Jorros had
clearly been expecting to hit squarely, and Tacharkal, who was squatting
nearby, woofed at his obvious discomfiture.  Less than two seconds later
Jadoch was watching the twain roll about, and laughed to himself.

young memory, and he reflexively stumbled back, throwing a fur-covered arm
up to protect his face.

The next morn was slightly warmer.  They were further south than before,
following this winding road down the mountains.  Days passed into nights,
and nights into days, and before long the bustle of the port town of Var
Bandor was before them.  Giving their small amount of coinage to the
ferryman to take them across the river, the two den-brothers make their way
into town.  Here they would seek - Them.

Jadoch stared up at the statue, a small grin spreading across his face.  He
had found Them.  And They had become home.  He glanced down at the marking,
his dark eyes taking in the eye inset in the triangle.  A strange symbol,
but they all wore it.  It was their sign, the emblem of this Enaerai.  He
shrugged, looking away from the tall statue.  Jadoch had found a new pack.
~
E
scroll3~
Though he had been weakened from the battle and his wounds, Jorros had
insisted he was fit for travel.  But the facts proved otherwise, as without
much of his natural fur covering, he was prone to the bitingly chill winds
that were apt to blow through.  And before long, he was ill.  They tried to
go on, but it proved futile.  And Jorros just got worse.  Again, Jadoch felt
that frustration that nothing he could do would save his brother.  Either
Jorros would make it, or he would not, and Jadoch could do naught to aid.

They buried his body in the ritual manner of the hero of their pack, leaving
no sign to mark his presence.  This was the order of things.  The death,
that others might live in their time.  That is what they sought to defend,
to uphold.
~
E
scroll2~
\#Seek.  Them.\#  All of them knew what he was talking about.  Less than a
week ago they had received the word, of others in the southlands, not of any
pack, who also sought to keep the order.  That was why they moved.  To seek
out - Them.  And so they would obey Kjolarnkos\@s last command, following in
his death the one who had led them in his life.  Scanning about the field,
they saw the one or two other unharmed survivors make for the forest, where
earlier (as Jadoch later found out) the females and pups had been
slaughtered.  They walked sadly about, trying to save any of the wounded,
but they were beyond salvation.  A sense of frustration grew in Jadoch\@s
restless spirit at his inability to help his pack, his friends.

Shaking his head slowly, Jadoch stood up from his haunches.  It was
Tacharkal\@s turn to keep watch.  As he moved over to wake him, he could not
shake the lonely feeling that had been with him since Jorros had fallen.

Tacharkal turned over in his sleep, huffing softly.  Jadoch glanced over,
then back to the fire that was now reduced to embers.  Much like the forest,
he thought wryly.  Poking at the glowing remains with a stick he had found,
his thoughts returned to the aftermath of the battle...
With their leader slain and little else to bind them together, the few
remaining Followers dispersed quickly into the part of the forest that was
not yet a raging inferno.  But so many of the pack, slain, or mortally
wounded.  Jadoch rushed to Jorros\@s side, beating out the fire with
hastily-scooped pawfuls of mud.  His concerned eyes sought Jorros\@s
condition.  He was alright.  The blaze had taken much of his fur but not his
life.

Tacharkal stood weakly from over the body of the Follower he had just
slain, and stumbled over.  Aside from minor cuts, he was miraculously
unharmed.  A suppressed woof of pain turned all three of their heads, and
they saw their leader, Kjolarnkos, as he lay in agony on the ground.  His
dark eyes had begun to glaze again, but they shifted to regard the youthful
ones.  His chest heaved, forcing out the voice.  \#Seek.  Them.\#  The rumble
of his words faded momentarily, then came again no longer focusing on them. 
\#Day into night.  Night into day.  Balance.\#  For the last time, his eyes
glazed over, and then his spirit left the world.

{WCONCEALING YOURSELF IN SHADOWS{n
        
To effectively hide yourself, it is important to be familiar with 
your environment.  Things like light sources, obstacles that 
obscure them and regular events that might draw attention can be 
very important.  A seasoned thief will be good at sizing up his 
environment quickly, but as a young student, it would be a good 
idea to spend some time in new places first and study them.
           
There are a few factors in hiding effectively.  First, as you would 
think, is that it is easier to conceal yourself in low or no light. 
Pay attention to where the lights are and whether or not any of 
them move.  You should usually be able to find at least one or two 
places that are dark enough to hide in.  Also, keep in mind that 
people could enter the room with more light sources.  Think about 
how the shadows would move if you were to add more lights.
          
Location of shadows is important, but there are many other factors 
involved in concealing yourself.  For example, there are situations 
where there simply are no shadows, or good obstacles to hide 
behind.  However, you can still avoid being noticed, even in a 
large crowd, if you remember a few things.
               
   {W-{nDon\@t look like you\@re trying to avoid notice.  Sudden or awkward 
movements are bound to draw attention.  Relax.  Move quickly, but 
make it look natural.
       
   {W-{n{RNEVER{n make eye contact.  More than anything else, this will get 
people to notice you.  If you have to look around, keep your gaze 
below eye level.  People tend to take less notice of you this way.
     
   {W-{nBe aware of what is going on.  If there is a big commotion going 
on one side of square, you will most likely be best off somewhere 
else.
       
   {W-{nNever let your guard down.  The most dangerous moment is when you 
think you are safe.  Do not, however, let a tense, rigid stance draw others\@
attentions.  Maintain a cool, relaxed exterior, and a wary interior.
        
   {W-{nRemember that every situation is different, and that there is 
usually something to learn.

{WWALKING SILENTLY{n
         
The most important part of walking silently is to understand that 
what works in one situation won\@t always work in every situation.  
You need to learn to adapt to your environment.
           
Now, there are two aspects to walking silently - not making any 
noise, and not drawing attention to yourself in other ways.
               
First off, good shoes are important.  Something thin that fits your 
foot tightly is usually your best bet - it allows you to feel the 
ground better, making it easier to stay light on your feet.  
Leather hides work the best for this.  If you are very good, 
wood-soled shoes might be ok.  You shouldn\@t try it with metal 
boots though, until you have mastered the art.
                 
Normally, when you walk, you take big steps and let your weight 
fall onto your feet.  When attempting to walk silently, you need to 
retrain yourself to keep your steps smaller, and to keep your knees 
bent slightly (it takes some practice to make this look natural).  
It sometimes helps to think of yourself as gliding along, rather 
than walking.  When you practice this, pay attention to the surface 
you are walking on.  Carpets and dirt are relatively easy to walk 
quietly on because the cushion absorbs the impact of your foot, 
reducing noise.  More difficult are squeaky wooden floors, echoing 
stone hallways and crunching grass are more difficult.  There is a 
tendency to look at your feet when you are learning to walk 
silently, but it is important for you to keep your eyes on the path 
ahead, so that you will be aware of obstacles or changes in 
surface.
               
There are many other things to keep in mind when you are trying to 
avoid being noticed.  Most of these will be addressed when you are 
learning to hide yourself in the shadows.

E
workbook1~
This small paper workbook is mostly filled with scribbled notes and
diagrams of various buildings, detailing floor solidity, door positions,
lock complexities and subtypes, and easy escape routes, all written out in a
confusing shorthand.  The pencilled notes seem rather designed to be
incomprehensible to any but the author.  On a few pages between an intricate
table of tally marks and numbers, however, a few pages are legible and
clear: 

{WPICKING LOCKS{n
     
Locks come in many varieties and sizes, but most of them work based 
on the same basic principle.  So, I\@ll explain that first.  There 
is a cylinder, called a plug, with a slot in it.  This slot is 
where someone would normally be putting the key to open the lock.  
Connecting the plug to the housing, there are some pins (usually 
between three and five).  When you put the key into the slot, the 
jagged side of the key pushes each pin to a certain height so that 
the breaks in the pins (each pin is actually two small pieces) line 
up into what is called the shear line.  When they line up like 
this, you can turn the key and open the lock.  When there is no key 
in the lock, springs push the pins down so the bottom part is 
completely inside the plug, and the top part is partially in the 
plug and partially in the housing, keeping the plug from turning.
               
So, in order to successfully pick a lock, you have to get the pins 
into their correct positions without the key.  There are two tools 
you\@ll need to do this: a pick and a tension wrench.  A pick is 
long and thin with a curve up at the end.  You use it to push the 
pins up.  There are lots of different kinds of tension wrenches.  
They are usually pretty simple.  You use them to turn the plug 
inside the housing.
                      
Once you understand how the lock works, picking them is pretty easy 
- it just takes practice.  What you want to do is to insert the 
wrench into the slot and turn it in the direction that you would 
turn the key.  This makes the shafts that the pins sit in not line 
up quite straight, creating a shelf between the plug and the 
housing.  Then, you need to use the pick to push each pin slightly 
upwards until the break in the pin meets the shear line.  When this 
happens, you should hear a slight click.  On some weak locks, you 
can actually hear it.  This means that the upper pin is resting on 
the shelf, so it isn\@t holding the plug in place anymore.  As long 
as you keep using the wrench to turn the plug, creating the shelf, 
the pins won\@t fall back down.  Use the pick to line up the breaks 
in each pin with the shear line and you should be able to turn the 
plug, opening the lock.

The ability to create a veil of magic is one of the major aspects of the
air sphere.  The most basic form of this ability is known simply as
Invisibility.  This spell will render the user or object unseen to eyes
untrained in its counterpart known as Detect Invisibility.  Like most spells
of preparation, this must be cast outside of combat, and it should be
noted that combat will bring the user out of concealment.  The more advanced
derivative of this spell is simply called Greater Invisibility-- unlike its
baser form, its veil can be maintained throughout combat.  The skilled
practitioner of such veils may also learn how to cast Invisibility en masse,
affecting his entire group within an instant. This is known as Mass
Invisibility.  There is one form of invisibility that cannot be detected
regardless of mortal resources.  This potent magic is known as the Rune of
Air.  Unlike the other veils which will keep with the users as they move,
the rune is set where it has been drawn.  The slightest movement will
disturb the veil and expose the user.  It should be noted that these runes
will conceal the entire party of the caster.  
     
Not all veils of air concern complete concealment. Some act as only a guise
to beguile the unwitting.  The most basic of this spell type is known as
Illusionary Object.  This spell will allow the caster to create a copy of an
object out of colored air.  The copy will appear exactly as the original
object-- however it will transfer no attributes besides appearance, since it
is in actuality nothing but air.  As one would expect, the magical copy will
be weightless and useless.  Another form of this masking involves persons
rather than objects-- this is known as Alter Self.  With this spell, the
caster will be able to take on the guise of another man whom must be present
before the caster.  However, as with masking objects, only appearance will
be transferred.  The armor of the target will not be copied, nor can the
auras be changed.  Regardless, most will be fooled by this powerful veil. 
This spell would prove useful in escaping the watchful eyes of enemies and
infiltration.

{rPain{n.  Pain is a virtue.  The blood in your veins is your lifeblood - the
fire seeks to destroy all that is living and consume it.  If you forget that
fact, forget what runs through your veins, forget what power you are
controlling, it will snuff out your life.  Pain lets you realize your
mortality and weakness relative.  I have always preferred dismemberment but
others have used scarring or breaking of limbs to good effect.  
         
Lastly, destroy.  Scholars of water study healing and beneficial spells -
should a healer forget that, they are dead.  The Inferno knows only death
and destruction - allow it to feed regularly or you will end up cast aside
and forgotten by the flames - with only a memory of what power you could
have wielded.  
       
Remember these facts and you may just catch a glimpse into the plane itself
and see the end of all things.

The Study of Fire is also not to be taken in the traditional sense.  Do not
expect to take your time and plod along a course of instruction and
education.  There is no course that Fire follows - you work at the pace that
it demands and that your mind can imagine.  Risk everything in your study,
fear nothing - bask in the flames when it comes your turn to have your skin
melted off from your bones.  
         
Now begins the basic of chants and spells from this place.  Channel the
smaller magics if you wish, but do not dally with that which is of no
interest to you.  The Inferno has no time to waste and therefore demands
such from those who learn from it.  If the fire does not burn in your heart
and the will does not exist in your mind, then the study of Fire will seem
pointless.  
          
Now, to the closing of this channel.  Once you\@ve unleashed your magic, it
is time to close the link to the Inferno.  This is not so much accomplished
by will as it is by pure chance - remember, do not try to predict the
outcome.  Resume your connection to the material plane and ground yourself
firmly on this earth.  It is common to feel a sense of loss - once you\@ve
viewed the Inferno in action it eats at your soul until you\@ve succumbed to
it completely.

This small journal is bound incongruously in white leather.  The few pages
with writing on them are filled with runic notes and measurements of
temperature, power, mana flows, and other less-comprehensible figures.
One page bears a detailed diagram of a dissected hand, and according channels
for spellcasting within the anatomy.  One particularly coherent stretch of
writing reads:
    
The plane of fire is power.  If you wish to harness power, then you\@ve
come to the wrong field of study.  The inferno is not \#controlled\#,
\#mastered\# or even \#communed\#.  It is witnessed, that is all.  You become
the conduit that the inferno uses to manifest itself on the material plane,
no more.  If you are destroyed in the process...  Consider yourself lucky to
have witnessed that which cannot be contained.  
       
Once you have finally submitted yourself to subservience to the plane of
fire, only then can you truly attempt the magics that thrive from it.  The
inferno itself should never be predicted or calculated - expect the
impossible and the fallible in your results.  But always expect a result.

{WThe Epic Poem of Fahn and Uhl{n
-----------------------------
  Upon the shores o\@er cliff and cave,
Of the Sea of Lidreau, a crashing wave,
Salt and surf spray upon the trees, 
The cool wind whistles through the leaves,
A tabor beat upon the breeze,
The clouds in the sky look o\@er the land.
    
From watery depths a beast did hail,
A firey tongue wound round its tail,
An eye of opal braced with scales,
Sword-like were its massive nails,
Which scratched and clawed the cliffs,
As the beast ascended to the land.
     
A stocky man of gnarled skin,
Drank all day and night of gin,
Nearly by this shore did dwell,
Fahn his name for all to tell,
Did see this monster wake from by the rocks,
And fell in fear to the sea soaked land.
   
A brother \@mongst his monstrous kin,
Name of Uhl did see herein,
This beast arise and drew his sword,
From his smoke filled den of stench abhorred,
Thrust it to the scaly beast,
Who tossed him to the land.
  
Fahn and Uhl saw the beast as it slew,
A nearby town of fisherman new,
Houses burned by pillars of fire,
Women and children swallowed by montrous mire,
Cast off previous deeds of evil,
And made haste to the monster, weapon in hand.
  
Fishermen of the town, knowing of these gnarled men,
And their many deeds of evil towards the very land,
Did expel them for fear of pillage and burn,
But Uhl and Fahn did have a plan, to aid them in return,
They launched mightily upon the beast,
And proud and strong were they to battle there.
  
Evading fire, tooth, and claw,
Did they plunge into the beast\@s maw,
Their swords did flash and flail in spite,
Blood glinting in the morning\@s light,
The beasts life drained slowly away,
Soaking full the rocky sea-side land.
  
Those of the town did laugh and sing with glee,
Seeing Uhl and Fahl, those they did despise,
Greatest of their gratitude, and friendship was bestowed,
Upon these who henceforth were to be mortally owed,
Now as those of the village were they,
No longer monsters to be slain.

{WHistory of this Text{n
  ====================
{W          Chapter Five{n
    
  This text is a compilation of various scrolls and books surviving the
War of Fire. I, the scribe, have been recruited to create this text 
for the srryn, who seek to regain the power lost to them so long ago.
In exchange for my services, the srryn will eliminate the nuisance of 
Earendam for I and my estate. Or, so they wish to think. As planned, they
will be slaughtered, and I shall walk away with the greatest tome of 
knowledge ever written. I shall hold true power. The srryn are such weak 
minded fools.

{WThe Incendiary Path{n
  ===================
{W         Chapter Four{n
  
  The following is all that was recovered from a young human trainee\@s log
book, preserved, miraculously, to this day. The following list and 
discussion contains all the knowledge that the young trainee in question
was absorbing from a master student. Be warned, fire does not only burn
wood and parchment.
  
  {rLesson One, Lyrenday, 22nd of the Sundering{n
    In the carefully prepared words of the master:
    
      \#The incendiary path is the one true path. In nature, does not
    the flame consume all? The forests are hungrily devoured, the plains,
    reduced to ashes. How misguided one must be to be a practitioner of
    another craft. Only the water can stop the fire, therefore, one asks,
    how could fire be stronger? Water cannot level forests, water cannot
    turn a fertile plain into a barren wasteland. Thus, once the flame
    catches, it will never stop, until all is consumed.\#
    
  {rLesson Two, Lyrenday, 29th of the Sundering{n
    Today, I first dabbled in the arts of the Inner Fire. Up to now,
    my only training in the flames that consume the world. Now, my focus
    shifts to the flames that burn in the heart, the flames that burn 
    long on the soul, the lusts. Master, quite correctly, states that
    only when one\@s soul is ablaze, can one walk through the inferno,
    and return unscathed.
  
  {rLesson Three, Lyrenday, 36th of the Sundering{n
    Never before have I been witness to such power, save for the prescence
    of our Lord Ssanthal. Master has indicated that not only must world,
    body, and soul be aflame, but the mind as well. It came to pass that
    my mind transcended the physical flames, to the chaotic energies of
    the world. I find myself becoming ever more like the flames every day.
~
E

{WFires Contained{n
  ================
{W     Chapter Three{n
  While information from the era has generally been lost with time, the 
scarce few surviving documents indicate a great fear across the land at
the mention of the name Ssanthal. No one believed that his fury could
be contained. He razed city after city in his unrelenting fury. However,
impossibility is a chain that binds only those who can afford it.
   
  Eventually, as scrolls from their own order tell us, the ancient aelin
monks at the Monastery at Caein\@Mar took it upon themselves to deliver 
the world from Ssanthal\@s might. Wielding the fully awakened power of the
shards of the Seas, they sought battle with the srryn. A long battle 
ensued, obliterating the surrounding countryside. 
   
  Even with their stalwart determination and mythic weaponry, they were
unable to extinguish the flame of Ssanthal. Therefore, they wove a spell
that would, while not returning Ssanthal to the Astral Plane, would imprison
him in eternal stone, forever a prisoner with his immense power. It came
to pass that Ssanthal\@s prison was to be cast into the depths of the ocean,
that he might never escape, and once again wreak havoc across Avendar.
~
E
book3~
{W  Caal\@s Fall{n
  ===========
{W  Chapter Two{n
    
  After leading the srryn for, presumably, quite a long time, Ssanthal
turned his gaze towards the mighty northern nation of Caal. From the
few scorched documents which survived his attack, and were subsequently
stored and studied by a monastic order for thousands of years, the 
destruction of Caal had been quick and ruthless. While srryn purists 
believe he incinerated Caal with a single thought, testimony from the
few survivors not driven mad paint a far more brutal picture. 
  An excerpt from a scroll scribed by a monk who was healing a particularly
wounded survivor of the Caal army:
      
    \#I was watching the countryside from atop the battlements, when 
   suddenly, the ground did shake and buckle. Pillars of flame, aye,
   lifted from the ground. Mighty they were, and our outer wall fell.
   Then the armies came, the srryn, thousands of them, swarming over 
   everything, snuffing out the light...\#
     
  After the intense destruction, the name of Ssanthal would never be 
forgotten by all who descended from the great nation.
~
E
book2~
{W  Firebrand of Sythtys{n
  ====================
{W           Chapter One{n
    
  Little is known of the early years of the one known as the Firebrand of
Sythtys, Ssanthal.  Srryn legends to this day tell that he was born from
a magma spewing hole in the earth, in a furious storm of flame and brimstone.
This is as good a story as any, considering the immense powers he possessed.
   
  From a young age, he showed extraordinary skill molding the flames to his
will. Ruthlessly, he slew his own masters, and whoever stood in his way.
Despite his immense power, he was suprisingly benevolent, to what extent
a srryn can be. Perhaps his mind had some greater lucid element to it, which
gave him such control. He had the rage of the most brutal srryn, but the 
intellect of a cunning aelin. In all likelyhood, he was aware that not
even he could contain the unending bloodlust of the entire srryn race.
Thus, the Firebrand of Sythtys was known and feared throughout the land.

{rThe Crimson Hand{n (??)
--------------------
One reason I am taking this journey is to discover any information available
regarding the rumors of a powerful assassin cult that has established itself
here in Rahh-Nefor.  Everyone I have spoken with so far about this cult has
denied its existence or claimed to have no knowledge of it.  Some nefortu
grow angry when it is mentioned, and a srryn merchant I approached on the
matter grew so furious that he nearly set his guards on me.
~
E
journal5~
Other than that, the civilization is quite unstructured compared to those
of the other races of Avendar.  I wasn\@t told directly, but could infer
that the Ajim-Chiaj doesn\@t exist so much to battle the drakes as they do
to keep order among the large rogue population--with a people so chaotic
and mischevious, often downright evil, the Ajiam-Chiaj is a necessity just
to keep the population stable.
  
  Let me see, what else... ah yes, diet and dress.  The Rahh-Nefortu, like
the drakes, feed primarily on fish and seaweeds found in the large sea
below their dwellings.  They do have occasional merchant visitors, keep
diplomatic relatioships open with the nearby Shuddeni, and are quite aware
of the styles and events up on the surface world.  The most notable dress
habit of the Rahh-Nefor is their use of rings--ear rings, wing rings,
even toe rings.  The main merchant in the cavern is a ring trader.
  
  Well--  these notes will suffice until I have time to prepare my treatise
on Rahh-Nefor for the Assembly.
~
E
journal4~
{WPart Two -- Notes on Rahh-Nefor{n
-------------------------------
  I spoke with various nefortu to collect this information:  a merchant, a
few drunks at in the common area up in the stalactites, and an old fellow
who demanded 50 gold before he would say a word.  Everyone else just 
sneered when I approached them.  Well, if 50 gold were always the price
of knowledge, we Seekers would be poor but happy.
  
  The Nefortu call this vast sea cavern Rahh-Nefor.  In their language, it
means \@Sea Nefortu\@, and designates both their particular colony, and the
name of this gigantic cavern.
  
  The Rahh-Nefor struggle constantly against the granite drakes that roost
in the southern area of the cave, in a giant crevice.  The drakes primarily
feed on fish, a drunk told me, but then he showed me a nasty scar and told
me that they didn\@t think twice about eating a slow nefortu.  Yesterday,
my own travelling companion was slain by a drake with viscious
talons, so I don\@t doubt the drunk was very lucky in his encounter.
  
  When I asked about their leadership, I got sneers and chuckles in
response.  I did manage to find out from the old fellow that there are
three primary figures in a nefortu colony:  the leader of the Ajim-Chiaj,
who organizes their military; the soothsayer, who serves as a religious
leader and is often a shaman with powers connected to fire, air, and void;
and the matron, the oldest nefortu female, who has the responsibility to
care for the young, because after nefortean parents give birth they do
not care for their offspring.

{W11 o\@clock pm, Day of the Great Gods, 22nd the Month of the Heat.{n
The descent through the tunnels was a testament as to why this place is
so little-known on the surface.  Vertical drops through thin shafts of
stone, an aggressive formation of eslingalis, species verdithius (common
name-verdah slime), and dangerous blasts of wind through a narrow
lava vent kept us on our toes.  Once into the great cavern, we spent
most of the day scouting around the southern half of the sea, finding
little more than fish and the neforteans who fished for them.
   
Tragedy struck our group today shortly after making camp around 7 pm.
We had stopped in a cavern, nearly hidden in a recess on a narrow
ledge along the western side of the lake. Before we had even set up watch,
we were attacked by a small granite drake.  Gylion was slain--alas that
we brought no water scholar--before we could wound the drake and drive
it away.  I created a small tremor to hide the cavern entrance with
rubble and boulders, lest the drake return to feed on our friend\@s corpse. 
   
Though we are all quite sad over the loss of Gylion, Pohe is in a fury.
He vows to see how well the drakes fight a prepared group.  Tomorrow,
I\@m sure he\@ll have ample opportunity to fulfill the vow, as we explore the
northern half of the sea and the lower air levels, and I attempt to glean
information about this place from its residents.

{WPart One:  The Journey to the Sea Cavern{n
========================================
{W10 o\@clock pm, Day of Freedom, 18th the Month of the Heat.{n
After considerable discussion, Pohe, Gylion, and I finally conviced Gwyd
to join us on a venture to the far-off caverns of the Rahh-Nefor.  I had
enlisted Pohe and Gylion, long-time travelling companions, quite easily
as they are never ones to turn down the chance to explore a new corner of
Avendar. We set out in morning. The reports of this venture will be sure
to make a fine presentation for the Assembly!
   
{W7 o\@clock pm, Day of the Great Gods, 21st the Month of the Heat.{n
According to the directions I obtained from a portly merchant who spoke
to us of the caves a few days ago, we followed south and west along
the Dantaron.  We used the first of our supply of flight potions to
get over the huge waterfall that spills from the mountain lake that is
the source of the Dantaron. The beauty of the falls and the mountain lake
requires a bard\@s tongue to do it justice.  We camped on the west shore
of the lake, where the dark tunnel leading to Rahh-Nefor begins.  Gwyd
had been a bit melancholy--like most rangers, he is a man of the open
spaces, and despises deep, dark caverns.  He has been suffering from a
cold as well. A fine-looking mountain hawk that lives on the lake\@s edge
has been speaking with him; perhaps his animal friend will acompany us
and help cheer him up.

After we had moved aside what little remained of its body, we were free
to examine the room.  The crewman, a human of the name of Kantru, had
obviously been using this room as some sort of crude magical laboratory.  A
few scrolls and notes were open on crates near the center of the room, where
an odd spiral shape had been painted in his own blood on the floor.  His
body, or what was left of it, had been dead for some hours.  
  
It was the air scholar who set me onto this line of thought, and I can\@t put
it out of my head now.  
  
\#What if,\# he said, in that pedantic tone scholars use, \#This wretch were
trying to conjure a demon while Borandus was casting his spell?  Could that
have set us awry?\#  
  
I took several scrolls from Kantru\@s tunic, and ordered the men to throw the
body overboard.  He doesn\@t deserve a grave in the sea, as the gods alone
know what he was really doing in my ship.  
  
After posting guards, I went back to my cabin to sleep and to write this, if
only to organize my thoughts.

{WDarkness, Second Entry{n
  
I awoke in the night to a scream of absolute horror.  I rushed out of my
cabin, sword in hand.  A goodly number of the crew were gatHered around a
storage hold.  We opened the door, and 
  
[Here, the ink is blotted as if the captain stopped for too long with pen to
page] 
  
and one of the new men I\@d taken on board in Earendam was there,
eviscerated.  A ghastly caricature of the man had part of his face and
skull, and was busy implanting the grisly totem into a blob of blackish goo.
The crewman\@s body dangled upside down in the room, its blood drained into a
brackish pool in an obsidian bowl placed below it.  
  
The thing..  The doppelganger screeched at us, and leaped at me.  I slashed
at it, in a futile effort to drive it back.  It grew claws, and sliced at my
throat.  I stepped back, just as one of the air scholars arrived, and
blasted the thing with lightning.  It hit one of the torches on the wall,
and caught fire almost immediately.  It yelled and screeched with its eerie
keening, and within just a few minutes was consumed.
~
E

As I write this now, we still have no idea where the ship is, I can still
make no reckoning that will locate us.  The sky is utterly dark, save for a
single red star far in the north.  There is not a trace of wind, and the air
is stale and foul.  
  
I had the men light torches on the deck, and that is when we made our most
disturbing discovery.  We float on a sea of some black liquid, slightly
thicker than water and with none of its wholesome properties.  It is
probably the source of the foulness of the air, and it reeks of
putrefaction.  We tried sounding the depths with our anchor, but could find
no bottom.  
  
Lacking any sign of land, I instructed the air scholars to generate wind for
the sails, and set course in the direction of the red star.  Borandus is
comatose, so I have set him up in my own bed, as it is all we can do.  
  
There is no rising or setting of the sun here, and even the red star is
listless and unchanging in the sky.  I end this log entry by candle as I
prepare to sleep, all frame of reference lost.

I...  Words cannot begin to describe what has befallen the fate of my ship
and my crew, but I must record it, if only that I might not believe it
ourselves if I did not take a written record.  
  
The day dawned, and Borandus made preparations for casting the spell.  He
bid the air scholars to cease their magics, concerned that their be no other
form of magical interference.  He stood on the foredeck, and cast his spell.
His voice rose and fell as part of some high chant, and a living warmth
swept through the ship.  
  
The mighty spell took hold, and I could feel the entire ship beginning to
flow into the ocean....  And then there was a horrible, deadly wrenching. 
Every part of me cried out in agony.  Like a thousand nettles, all jabbed
into the soft parts of your body.  
  
Most all of us collapsed, some for hours, others, for a few moments.

We departed Earendam today, leaving the city\@s docks on the Dantaron. 
Thanks to the presence of the air scholars, we made on our northeasterly
course with all speed.  Borandus tells us that we must be sufficiently far
from land for the spell to work, and I intend to oblige him.  
  
Nothing else of note, except that we have reached our destination by
nightfall.  I had an excellent dinner in my quarters with Borandus and
Hajja, the head of the warriors from the Thrantian school.  Hajja is a keen
hand with his blade, and Borandus knows the ocean currents as well as any
captain I\@ve known.  If his magic is as good as his gold and his sea lore, I
expect to be sipping Gaald ale by sunset tomorrow.

...Borandus is the name of the scholar who wants to try the experiment.  He
claims that he has perfected a new version of the \@Meld with Water\@ spell
that can move far more than just a handful of people -- he claims it can
move an entire ship and its contents!  
  
Most captains would scoff at the notion, but I own the Ilal today because I
was willing to take risks.  And, unlike many of the other daft sea dogs who
ply the Uthlin, I don\@t have any superstitions about Iandir-knows-what
dragging my ship under the waves for trafficking with scholars.  
  
The fellow seems to have ties to the Tower, or at least, is independently
wealthy as well.  When I expressed concerned about ending up in mid-air, or
even parts unknown, Borandus provided gold to hire air scholars (I once had
to transport the ship overland this way -- expensive, but effective) and a
contingent of warriors from the Thrantian school.  For myself, I made sure
we had extra supplies, and got a half dozen more sailing men to replace the
ones who\@d left after the last long voyage.  The test is scheduled two days
from now, and Borandus wants to sail from Uthlin to the Lidraeu, some
distance off the shore of Gaald.  It\@s a long shot, but I\@ve taken a cargo
of fine silks and Lithling wine on board.  Even if we don\@t make it to
Gaald, there\@s always a demand for the finer things eastward along the
Uthlin.

Borandus is awake and about on his feet now, although, in my heart, I almost
rue his return now that I know the Truth.  
  
Borandus progressed rapidly in healing himself yesterday, using his magic to
help himself recover quickly.  He complained of the magic seeming sluggish,
almost weaker than it ought to be, but at first ascribed this as being a
result of the psychic trauma.  
  
When I took him out of my cabin, and showed him the place we were in, he
very nearly collapsed again.  He staggered, and the look on his face...  It
showed more pain than at any time when he had lain comatose.  
  
He motioned me back into the cabin, and told me ...  Something I can barely
put words to...  [here, the pen of the captain obviously trembles, and there
is another large inkblot.]

The creatures seemed to flee from fire, or at least, displayed some small
aversion to the light it shed, and that helped us in finally putting paid to
them.  The fight ended, and most of us returned to our quarters, but I kept
a double watch.  
  
I think that it helped the men to have something to do other than fret and
bellyache, but...  I have already seen the cold fear in some of the eyes of
the younger seamen.  The things we fought tonight were not like anything I\@d
ever seen.  
  
I cannot voice my true suspicion yet.  It is too horrible, and it would kill
all hope in the men.

{WDarkness, Third Entry{n
  
The first thing I did when I awoke was to puzzle through the parchments I
found on the recently departed \#crewman\#.  Some of the scrolls were
obviously spells -- meaningless mystical scribblings to me, but I could see
that Kantru was no true sailor -- he was at least a journeyman scholar. 
More troubling, I found a scrap of a letter, from Kantru to a merchant in
Earendam of the name of Bahand.  
  
Kantru promised in the letter that, \#the captain will meet his doppelganger
and be dealt with before we next meet.  I expect payment in the usual
location.\#  Bahand is the leader of a small consortium of merchants in
Earendam I refused to trade with because I felt their prices were
exorbitant.  
  
I can only suppose that the creature Kantru summoned was this doppelganger,
only his spell had gone drastically wrong.  If it was his summoning which
disrupted Borandus\@ spell, then perhaps it cuts both ways, and he met a
horrible end at the hands of the demon he sought to bind with his own blood.
  
The rest of the day was relatively uneventful.  As far as I could tell, we
made no real progress in any direction, but it\@s hard to tell, owing to the
lack of landmarks and the fact that the accursed red star never moves a
degree.  
  
As I write this, there is little more to report than Borandus still lies
sleeping.  We poured water down his throat, but there was little more that
could be done.  
  
[At this point in the log, several pages have been ripped, and the next
entry is fragmentary]

...Morale is lower than ever.  This is my tenth entry since the darkness,
and there seems to be no change.  Rather than let fear seize the crew, I let
one of the air scholars spread his theory that we are in some deep
underground sea, and the red light is a clump of fungus.  I told them to
keep watch for signs of shuddeni, thinking an enemy the men were familiar
with might steel them.  
  
Borandus still lies unconscious, but his breathing is lighter now.  If he
awakens, perhaps his magic can ...  No, it is best not to garner false
hopes.  
  
I have a suspicion about our fate, but I will not voice it.

{WDarkness, Fifteenth entry{n
  
They attacked while most of us were sleeping.  It was against reason, but I
have kept burning our scant supply of torches each time the men were on
guard.  Call it luck, divine favor, or just cussedness on my part, but my
men saw the things when they emerged from the murk, and started clamber up
onto the ship.  
  
Some of them were lumps of goo, with mortal faces.  They cursed at us,
spitting a viscous poison at my men.  There were skeletons, covered with the
black waters of the sea, who clutched and clawed at the side of the ship,
dragging men down beneath the waters.  Finally, and most frighteningly,
there were doppelgangers, each of which took the form and abilities of one
of the defenders.  
  
It was not the hardest fight that I have ever faced, but I certainly have
never seen one more chilling.  I watched Hajja slash through the blobs with
his blades, and tripping an opponent who looked exactly like him off the aft
of the ship.  Then, as I was locked in combat with a half dozen skeletons, I
was forced to watch as two of my best men were dissolved and devoured by the
blobs.

Another attack by the denizens of this place.  Only one casualty this time,
but I can see the light in the men\@s eyes die a little more each day.  They
wonder why they are fighting this fight, when a cleaner death would come at
the hands of their own blades.

\#Can you not simply meld us into this sea, and take us home that way?\#  asked
I.
  
\#I have already tried.  What we are on is not water.  And even if we could,
we are on the wrong the side of the Veil.  I do not have the magics required
to open it.  
  
\#Captain, I can only offer my humblest apologies for damning both you and
your crew.  I can see no way out of this dark place.  Tell your men what you
will, and I will aid you against however I can, but I recommend you make
your peace with the gods now.\#  
  
Before we slept that night, I called the men together, and told them what
Borandus had revealed.  Frankly, I felt that if we were to die, they
deserved the truth.  And, all told, they took it fairly well.  I think some
of them suspected that we were no longer in Avendar, and we had fought
demons in this place.  A few paled, and one of the youngest fainted, but on
the whole there was grim silence.  
  
Really, I could see no possibility of mutiny here, in this place.  What
would they do with the ship?  Where would they go, or do that we weren\@t not
already trying?  No, my deepest fear was the despair it might have on my
shipmates.

I will forever remember the cold dread in Boranthus\@ voice.  
  
\#Captain, we are not underground, in some great moat of the shuddeni.  If
that were so...  If only that were so.\#
  
\#Captain, where we are is barely a place at all.\#
  
\#For we are in the Void.  \#
  
\#This ship, your crew, we all..  We are sailing across the Dead Sea, the Sea
that is Not.  We sail across the ichors of death and decay, in which no
living thing can grow.  \#
  
Overhead, that star in the sky.  It is no star.  It is the Eye of Bahhaoth,
queen of this place.  It gazes down, uncaring, on the unlife and
abominations of the Sea.  
  
You could sail for ten eternities, and not reach the edge of this place.  
  
I ..  I did not anticipate an acolyte of the void to attempt a potent spell
just as I cast.  The touch of the Void upon my magic twisted it.  Rather
than melding to another spot on the ocean, it took us to the closest thing
to an ocean...  Here in the Void.\#  
  
There were some moments of pregnant silence, as the news wormed its way into
my head.

They found my first mate, swinging from the yard arm where he had hung
himself.  I cut him down myself, as I had too much respect for the man to
see anyone else do it.  
  
I wondered what to do with the body -- I didn\@t have the heart to toss it
into the foul darkness over the edge of the boat.  Borandus offered to dry
the body out by draining the water, so we could store it in a makeshift
coffin (a crate, really) without the smell.  
  
As we were getting a crate from the store room where that accursed void
scholar had cast his spell, Borandus saw the remaining trappings of the
ritual and cried out,
  
\#Of course!  I have it!\#  
  
And with that, he and three of the air scholars locked himself in my cabin,
excitedly discussing something.  
  
Disgruntled, I wrote this, and rested in my mate\@s cabin.  A little morbid,
but I\@m not fool enough to sleep on deck in this place.

E
book6~
{WDarkness, Twenty-Sixth Entry:{n
  
Today, there is hope.  Borandus and the scholars invited me into my cabin,
and laid out what they think could be a plan.  
  
Borandus assumed his lecturing tone, which I have become all too familiar
with in recent days.  
  
\#As you may or may not be aware, Avendar and the Void are separated by a
border region, what demonologists refer to as \@The Silver Veil\@.  This
thing, this structure, prevents free travel from the Void to our own world. 
  
\#It can be bypassed, of course, if sufficient magical energy is used to
travel to another plane (very difficult in the negative energy well that is
the void), or to open a hole in the Veil.  
  
\#It\@s something of a mystery how the Veil was constructed -- some say the
gods placed it there, to save the world from ruin.  Others maintain it\@s a
natural phenomena, a natural membrane between worlds.  Yet others believe
that it was created by the alatharya, who wanted more control over
demonkind, and created a planar artifact of ancient magic.  And the scholar
Akkarlis writes that...\#
~
E
book7~
\#Get to the point!\#, shouted one of the air scholars.  
  
\#Yes, as I was saying.  We do not possess the resources or the wherewithal to
open our own gate through the Veil.  However, any scholar of the void opens
a weakness, or a tear in the Veil whenever he or she conjures a demon.  I am
certain that this place is home to some of the demons that those dark
sorcerers draw from -- your experience with the doppelganger in the hold
proves that.  
  
\#That means that, periodically, gates from Avendar to this place, the Dead
Sea, must open.  It is theoretically possible that we could use these holes,
or gates, or bridges, or what have you to escape from here.  
  
\#There are several problems, however.  
  
\#Firstly, there is the matter of finding the gate when it opens.  We have
discussed mechanisms for finding this, and I believe the air scholars and I
have found a way.  Our magic (as, indeed, all elemental magic other than
negation) is slightly less strong here, on the Void.  
  
\#As the boundary between our two planes softens, we should detect our magic
becoming imperceptibly stronger.  We need only follow the path of greatest
strength.\#

This will likely be my last entry.  We have found the gate, and now, the
Ilal heads directly into the maw of the largest whirlpool I have seen in my
waking life.  
  
As soon as the scholars began the incantation to make it, the seas began to
boil with activity.  Wave after wave of demon and undead emerged, their
sickly slurping a dark chorus to our work.  
  
The Thrantian warriors pushed them back again and again, while my men and I
backed them up.  I had them light the last of our torches -- if this does
not work, we will have no need of them.  The doppelgangers came next, and
were almost successful -- one took my place, and was directing the crew to
attack themselves.  
  
The first part of the casting was done, and a dark eye opened in the water. 
  
Now, I am at the wheel of the ship, in the wheelhouse near the middle of the
deck.  I write this as we turn and move toward the whirlpool.  Skeletons are
thick about the structure, but I have an old rune I bought several trips ago

Skimming through the journal, you come across many entries of a technical
nature - drawings, measurements, and discussions on this or that component,
and plans regarding what next to build.  Toward the end of the journal,
spanning a period of a few years, the writer seems to be focusing on a
single, magnificent creation.  It\@s impossible to tell exactly what, as the
drawings are quite complex and abstract, although it seems to be a massive,
room-sized time piece of some description.  As this work progresses, the
handwriting be becomes spidery, scrawled and hard to read.  The writer
seems to be becoming more and more obsessed.  The final couple of pages are
in clear handwriting again, and the entries become highly agitated and
fervent. They read as follows: 

The Dragon\@s Feast

Ah, recalcitrant time!  Have I not given you enough these past decades?  For
five generations my family have served you as the greatest clockmakers in
the world, and for sixty years I myself have been your herald and your
doomsayer.  Each clock I built was monument to your mastery of the lives of
men.  Each silver face, gilded hand, and pendulum of brass an acknowledgement
of the inevitability of your grasp.  Now my wife is in your talons - I could
not save her, though it broke my heart to watch Adele slowly die.  I have
given you all that is mine, but my daughter I hold back!  You shall not have
her! I shall master you, and bend your passing to my own will!  No longer
shall my creations merely gauge your passing, eaking out your flow in
meager, devastating portions.  I shall build a device that holds you, binds
you, and masters you.  Thus will Constance be saved from your claws.

history1~
In the beginning, were the gods. Some to create,
some to destroy, some to taint, others to bring
hope, others to simply be. The gods, though, were
alone in the universe. Seeking a canvas for their
essence, they created the world of Avendar.
And, edged along ever so carefully by the gods
of creation, they created the alatharya,
first children of the gods. 

To the alatharya, the gods gave their greatest
gift - Magic. Magic to create, magic to destroy,
some portion of each of the gods\@ essences was 
sent to swirl through the prime material, creating 
the ether, the Quintessence from which mages drew 
their power.

As time passed, the alatharya waxed mighty. The
gods, pleased, began plans for other creations,
each mighty in their own way. But the Alatharya
were not content with the god\@s plans to make
others - jealous of the thought that other
children might bring the god\@s attention away
from them, and coveting the Quintessence, they
sought to steal the power of the gods. With their
mighty pyramids, and strange rites, their priests
and scholars came together one fateful night for
a grand theft. In their hubris, they sought to
steal the power of the gods for themselves, and
make of themselves Creators. 

But, alas, it was not to be. The gods knew of the
theft, and instead of invoking the power of the
gods, they invoked their deepest and darkest
wrath. All across Avendar, the great cities of the
alatharya were rent in blood and fire - their
libraries burned, their pyramids turned to
rubble, their homes driven to the four winds. The
revenge of a god is not a small thing, and the
revenge of the combined might of a pantheon can
level entire worlds. So it was that the Alatharya
were cast from their pinnacle as the mightiest of
races. No more would the minds of the Alatharya
follow the intracies of magic - nor would the
Alatharya do nought than strive for balance in
their day to day life, fearful of retribution for
their ancient crime. And, lastly, the gods
sundered Magic from its pure form into its
elemental components. Water, Spirit, Wind, Fire,
Void, and Earth did it break them, and forever
shatter the mortal dream of attaining the divine
through mystic arts. 
~
E
history2~
This sundering of the Magic released cataclysmic
storms of magic over the surface of Avendar, which
changed and alteried all that they touched. Of the
god\@s new children, vast changes were wrought,
some for good, some for ill. The aelin were
granted flight, and the gift of keen reason. The
caldarans learned wisdom, and were turned from
the night. At the same time, the brutal srryn
were born, spawn of languid swamp and foul
hearts. Beneath the earth fled the shuddeni,
blind minions of pure darkness, driven mad, some
say, by a love of much knowledge. 

The centuries after the Sundering of Magic were
dark ones. It was not until some hundreds of
years that civilization began anew, with the proud
selin and their cities in the skies. Striving,
perhaps, for a memory of things past, they
collected the artifacts of the ancient slatharya,
and built cities that at least faintly echoed the
glories of ancient days. 

And so it was the selin waxed powerful, the
srryn confined to their torpid swamps and the
shuddeni to their caves, and all others brought
into alliance with them. For a time, it appeared the
world would never again know such a destruction,
until, at last, the gods allowed a new race to
awaken on Avendar - the humans. 

The humans were taken by any and all things,
some easily swayed to evil, others relentless
paragons of virtue. Some claimed them akin to
gods, others to devil-spawn of the Void, others
still to reckless children. Nevertheless, the
passion that drove the humans lead them, at first,
into a reckless alliance with the brutal srryn. 
~
E
history3~
In their midnight rituals, the srryn had learned
much of the ways of fire. Fire to burn, fire to
make their will be done - fire, to destroy. The
humans, always more keen of wit, seized the
secrets of the srryn fire shamans, cultivated
among their numbers the first Scholars of Fire.
Savage men, of an unholy taste for pleasure and
power, unleashed their magics across the surface
of Avendar. 

Securing the yoke about their fellow men, the
great Scholars of Fire also trained warlords, or
templars of fire, to command in battle with the
sword, and yet still reign destruction with the
forces of fire. Most of the races scattered
before the hordes of humans and srryn that
plundered all they found, but the aelin stood to
defend their cities, and forged an alliance to
fight to keep the humans at bay, lest the night
consume all. 

Cities were reduced to ash. Aelin died in droves,
using their already small collection of ancient
artifacts to drive the humans back. And yet, again
and again the humans surged forward. Quick to
breed, quick to die, the humans stood at the
verge of a destruction that would consume all. 

Fortunately, not all among the humans thought as
the Scholars of Fire. Small in number, but
present, were humans who sought meaning in
more than brute destruction. Groping blindly,
they sought to bring peace, to heal, to purify.
They craved a life spent in other activity than
blind devotion to an orgy of chaos and
destruction. 

Praying to the gods, they were answered. Jolinn,
Father of the Seas, Lord of the Sapphire Spear,
sent these brave few to seek the titans, who
dwelt high in the mountains, where they had
slumbered since the Sundering. Waking, they
taught the humans of the magics of Water, and of
the strength of the Seas. These humans
returned, and became the first of the Scholars
of Water. Born to bring healing to a troubled
land, their love of life quenched the inferno of the
fire mage\@s hate. With their aid, the aelin drove
the armies of Fire back to the swamps, where
most of the Scholars of Fire were put to the
sword. 

Thus ended what the chronicles tell of as the War
of Fire, when men nearly brought ruin once more
to the world. 
~
E
history4~
And yet, the aelin were not the ones to come to
dominance after the war. The humans, their
passion driving them still, slowly grew in numbers
across the surface of Avendar, while the aelin
remained in their cities, lost in the intracicies of
their own life. 

Those humans not already devoted to healing
learned much of the ways of earth from the god
Iandir, who brought law once more to the hills and
valleys of Avendar. Men paused in their mad
growth, and built cities, homes, places of staying,
order, and protection. 

And thus, many thousands of years passed.
Quarrels came and went, but none so great as a
war to drench and entire world in Fire. And so it
was that the empire of the Humans subsumed the
entire world. And yet, the humans were drawn to
more than just the surface, and began their
explorations of the nether regions of Avendar.
There, they found the great cities of the
shuddeni, a race blinded by the night, but who
still saw much, and gloried in the horror of the
demon sultans who taught them. 

Here, human scholars went who wished to learn
more. Tortured they were by the shuddeni, but
some, a few, learned their ways. Combining the
ritual of the shuddeni with the ancient learning of
the humans, the discipline of the Void was born. 

Who can say why the gods suffer such things to
exist? Certainly, the gods of the dark revel in the
Void, the Things which inhabit it not always of
their own creation, but often after their own
heart. Certainly, what the Scholars of the Void
did was the antithesis of life, and everything
living, but the gods of light could not bring and
end to them without disturbing the balance of the
world. 

So it was, those humans who studied with the
Shuddeni waxed mighty in their counsels, and
taught the shuddeni much of the ways of war. The
shuddeni culture, grown stagnant in their
millennia under stone, was re-energized by the
promise of conquest above the surface. On the
blackest night, of the darkest day of the year,
the humans and their shuddeni allies road forth
from the caves of their dank abyss, to usher in an
age of Night the world had never known. 
~
E
history5~
Striking with meaning, order, and purpose rather
than out of blind rage, the forces of the Void
took cities, rather than burning them, and
corrupted them to their will. Mothers were
forced to offer their children as appeasement in
unholy rites, designed to serve the Things which
dwell beyond, some were kept as slaves, but the
cities under the sway of the Void lived, even if
they were more the corpses of cities than
anything resembling a living organism. 

The templars of water mounted counter-assault
after counter-assault. Some times, with success,
other times, with failures. For long 
years, the two sides held sway in a series of
enormous battles. With time, thought, the
Scholars of Water found their magic growing
weaker - the Things of the void had grown strong
on the flesh of the young, and pressed for more
mortal flesh. When all seem darkest, when even
great Earandam thought to send its children to
the aelin amidst the moutain, the unthinkable
happend in the ranks of the Void. 

Their dark rites prepared, their rituals chanted,
they brought forth not demons or other Things,
they brought forth instead the ch\@taren. The
ch\@taren, whether exiles from the world of
dreams or even the fabled astral plane, had used
the magic of the void against itself, and had
travelled into the Prime Material by means of
their gateways. 

Bringing with them large numbers and the magics
of the Spirit, they routed the dreadlord templars
of the void to their holes in the ground, where
those that served Fire waited, and picked off the
weak among them. Humans learned of the
freedom of the Spirit, and everywhere, cast off
their chains, and drove the fiends of the Void
back once more into seclusion. 

And, thus ended the War of the Night, where
men learned that the candle of hope flickers even
in the blackest of times. 
~
E
history6~
The ch\@taren settled among men, whose empire
lies shattered. The other races, long secluded by
humankind, came forth to a new Renaissance.
Some learned of the ways of the aelin, and
brought forth their own creation - the magic of
Air, which sought no rule, order, or code, merely
meaning in its own chaotic existence. 

Thus, all six of the great elemental magics were
brought to Avendar. Men, in time, sought to form
again their empire, but found the world too vast a
place - Ethron inhabitants of forest oaks, Dark
winged nefortu dangling in their dark places,
and even the alatharya of yore were returned in
diminished form. 

Still, for a time men formed a Republic on the
main continent of their home, but, in recent times,
these alliances were sundered by the raids of the
Kankoran barbarians and their allies. This has
resulted in the city states we see today -
Earandam the grand, Var Bandor, and even Ashta
Harrud, desert capitol of commerce. 

All races today find more meaning in finding their
own niche in the struggle for power, rather than a
great gasp at one empire. The Houses of Avendar
reflect this diversification of thought among the
people of Avendar. Likewise, the Scholars\@
Towers, were even the mages of void and spirit
exist in an uneasy detente. 

Moreso than any time in history, the world is a
wide place, separated by long distances, with
opportunity awaiting around every street corner
in the great cities. A time, where, perhaps, the
future belongs to those who would take it, and
dare to tread the Siege Perilous - a time for
adventurers.....

The pups of the Chakkach clan are raised from birth knowing how to read the
 tartan, which is a history of the individual written in wool.  Blood members
 are recognized by a dark red stripe running down the centre of their tartan,
 while birth members bear a blue swath.  The Thane is told apart by a curious
 yellow zigzag.  The Shaman wears a bone fetish, pinned in the manner of a
 broach, over the heart.  
  
 Gender roles within clan Chakkach deviate far from Southron norms.  Males
 are adept at traditional female tasks such as spinning, weaving, and
 cookery, and females and males hunt as equals.  Females will give birth
 standing upright in the fierce weather of their homelands, barely pausing
 the hunt to clean the infants before continuing.  This also serves the dual
 purpose of ensuring that hardy pups survive, as well as further inuring the
 Chakkach to the brutal weather.
~
E
set2~
Due to the small and spartan nature of the Chakkach, as well as their
 nomadic roamings at the Top of the World, inbreeding has been a problem
 which, in the past, has threatened their very existence.  To allow for this,
 Thane Takkarilk many decades ago began sending the younger, more aggressive
 males south into the Ryarl plains to search for new blood to mingle with the
 Chakkach lineage.  Over the years, the Chakkach lost the traditional
 kankoran clan-based xenophobia, yet gained an inherent distrust for other
 species.  
  
 The militant tradition of the Chakkach also sets them apart from their
 Ryarl cousins, for they are considered savage even for kankoran.  Warriors
 to the bone, their standards of incorporating worthy kankoran into their
 clan has given them the nickname of the Blood Warriors -- the original
 meaning of Chakkach.  A curious ceremony, a Chakkach (by blood or birth)
 must slice his paw and that of the initiate, pressing and mingling their
 blood.  The outsider is then Chakkach by blood, and is then given the right
 to wear the Chakkach tartan.  A Chakkach\@s tartan, more important to him or
 her than even their fur, is to be worn constantly -- while bathing, hunting,
 or making love.
~

This section of a book is still bound together with tough glue and strong
thread at one end, though the unit has been torn forcefully from the spine
of a book.  Fragments of studies on various kankoran tribes are written at
the beginning and end, but the only intact article is the following: 

 A fiercely interdependent and loyal sect of the ferocious Ryarl packs, the
 Chakkach broke off many centuries ago, at the end of the second Kankoran
 wars, or, as they prefer to call it, the War of Southern Aggression.  Their
 clan political structure, at once highly regimented and highly fluid,
 revolves around one Warrior-Thane, usually passed on by birth to the
 firstborn of every previous leader.  This Thane is backed by a Shaman or Lore-Master, 
 who is designed to take command in times of duress, or when the Thane is
 incapacitated.  At any time, the Shaman may be challenged to combat in
 contest for his title, making the Shaman\@s position far more martial and far
 less shamanic than an outsider would think.  This ensures that the most
 prominent and wily warriors have a say in the Clan\@s decisions.  
  
 A Chakkach is forbidden to raise his paw against another Chakkach for -any-
 reason, unless done under these codes of Contest.  
  
 The Thane and the Shaman are the only two \@positions\@ of the Chakkach Clan,
 and not recognized as leaders in the way of the Southron militaries. 
 Rather, their historical position is to guide and channel the emotions of
 their Clan, to calm or to arouse when necessary.  Only in times of great
 emergency does a Shaman or Thane claim true dominance over the Clan --
 historically, it has only happened twice, once during the spring of Smashing
 Ice, and the second time during the Meteor\@s Collision.

[{WEdit. note:{n from the Bardic Collegium in Earendam, delivered by hand]
  
Greetings, Lords and Ladies of the Muses,
  
I write to you this fine summer morn to beg my acceptance into the School
of Song, though to be attached to the branch in Var Bandor so as to be
closer to home.  I have often been enraptured by the many entertainers and
gleemen who pass through our lovely home of bucolic Eril, and wish to give
some of that merriment back to the world which, I am finding, is for the
most part a somewhat dark place in need of the Light of song.
  
I have been complimented with my skill with the fiddle, which my father
taught me to play since I was three, and my mother has taught me to toodle a
few notes on the throatbox as well.  I must confess, however, that my
singing and fiddling has on more than one occasion landed me a night locked
in a root cellar or an old dusty attic for my satirical comments.  Though
sophomoric and puerile, I seem to have a knack for raising the hackles of
the haughty and self-inflated.
  
I am but a humble farm-boy, 15 years old, seeking to enrich and embroider
his own family tapestry with something more than brown wool homespun.  My
parents till the earth, growing potatoes for the Tavern down the road, and
my father distills his potato brandy from time to time (which, I must say,
can be a Muse all on its own...  The songs you hear!)  .  I myself have
fought no fights, except when young Eqilon tackled me for kissing his kid
sister....  And Hartho, for his....  And Mylestan, for his -older- sister...
And...  It seems I digress.  My only other martial victory was an epic
battle with a hornet\@s nest, which I hope to one day set to music in the
tradition of Pelloro Nimblefingers. 
  
I beg of you to consider my training in the ways of the gleeman.  I am
quite the plain figure, with little to no glamour behind my story, but I
hope to make such a story with my future as to rock the foundations of the
world. 
  
Humbly your servant,
[signed]Gaeltos Eltir-Qalon

[WEdit.  Note:{n Copied from single page of a torn journal recovered by a
junior Keeper as he explored in the valleys and mountains of the north
forest.  Journal has since vanished without a trace..  B.R.] 
  
{WEvenday, 17th day of Converumir{n
  
    Today I set out from Earendam with our company.  In total, we are five
 scholars and ten warriors.  Two of the scholars are my fellow Salyrans, we
 being the tower\@s most skilled adepts in the spells of curse removal.  The
 other two scholars, of the Order of the Silver Light, travel with us as
 well, likewise skilled in the countering of curses.  The complementary
 escort of guards, we have rather resented--as if this band has need of the
 patrician\@s protection!  We appreciated the irony of the situation
 though--one of the spirit scholars, a human named Tov, noted rightly how it
 is the patrician who always seems to be in need of protection. 
  
 The patrician, I understand, has contacts with Chevellen, a nobly-born
 Salyran adept, and asked him to organize a party of cursebreakers.  Why he
 chose not to approach the guildmasters, and rely on (highly capable) adepts,
 I can\@t say--I\@ve no head for political manuevering.  But we, of course,
 jumped at the chance to challenge this curse, even if the circumstances of
 our departure are less forthright than we would chose.  Defeating such a
 curse would make a case for guildrank advancement, for certain!  
  
 We only know rumors of Nordath--that it lies in a deep forested valley
 with a single pass entrance, and that the valley is located in the North
 Forest, near its southern end, almost bordering the grasslands.  Nordath
 was, as the history texts describe it, once the seat of an important Barony
 of the old Earendam republic.  The curse supposedly involves old spirits and
 undead, and even demons. 
  
 We\@ve heard that the curse has drawn mortals who enter the valley under
 its power, and that the bones of those who die rise again, joining the
 undead.  I, of course, have been taking the standard measures of precaution-
 one can never be too careful when dealing with curses.  And my dear Ladiira
 was so worried when she heard of the journey.  But there has never been such
 a company as this, I told her, for challenging ill hexes--we could even lift
 the blight off of the Shargob, no doubt.  In fact, I\@d even suggest such a
 trip to Shargob to my companions, once we finish our work here, if it
 wouldn\@t keep me long from my Ladiira\@s side.  -Awsar

In the aftermath of what became known as the First Kankoran War, Earendam
was forced out of political necessity to cede its claim to the far reaching
provinces of the Republic, and the leadership of the city passed from the
Senate (now in disgrace) to a ruling Patrician, which became a lifetime
leader selected from among the city\@s nobility.  
  
For those that balk at the thought of the social institutions of a Republic
changing so thoroughly, let us not forget the stresses Earendam faced, and
the fact that the institution of the Patrician mimicked the long- standing
familial order of the city-dwellers, where a single rich noblemen would
support many by his largesse.  For these reasons, some have gone beyond the
claim that the office was born of necessity, but rather, the role of the
Patrician was a cultural inevitability.  
  
Despite these changes, the unified voice that the Patrician brought to
Earendam\@s politics lead to an unprecedented growth.  The north side of the
city was rebuilt, in part using the magics of earth, and changes in the laws
regarded trade resulting in a small merchant class flourishing.  Artisans
and scholars once more came to Earendam, viewing it once more as a bastion
of culture.  [In this humble author\@s opinion, Var Bandorian scholars choose
to live in a cesspool].
~
E
book4~
This period of decline continued until circa three centuries ago, when a ten
year period of long winters and poor harvests intensified political unrest
in the Republic to the breaking point.  Provinces in the south began to
revolt, refusing to supply the already overpopulated Earendam with the
tribute and food it desperately needed.  In the north, a new breed of
kankorans had migrated from across the Uthlin, lead by fierce far leaders
and fighting with a fanatical desperation.  Trade disputes with Var Bandor
further alienated Earendam from the western provinces, and turmoil over the
open worship of the dark gods caused a furor in Earendam itself.  
  
When the kankorans began a long and bloody series of campaigns in the
northlands, Earendam\@s military proved unable to satisfactorily deal with
the menace.  Caught unprepared, and lead by generals who had never had
actual experience in battle.  Caught in the itinerant raids lead by
barbarian warlords, Earendam\@s army was defeated in a long series of bloody
battles, and driven back to the walls of the city itself.  
  
In what is most likely the low point of Earendam\@s history, most of the
ruling Senate fled the city, fearing for their own lives.  The citizens
rallied under the leadership of a man named Corvandil Novis, head of one of
the city\@s oldest noble houses.  While the ensuing battle ravaged the
northern half of Earendam, the battle put an end to the kankoran presence in
the area for the next two hundred years.  
  
~
E
book3~
The new magics used in the War of Night had a deeper influence on the
culture of the Republic than might have been expected.  It was not a matter
of citizens summoning demons or speaking to dead relatives, but rather the
more subtle powers of the magic that began the process.  The simpler magics
of void allowed for easy travel across vast distances, as well as the
similar powers of the scholars of spirit.  Knowledge traveled quickly and
easily between cities, and fractious and dissident thought proliferated. 
When the magics of air came into the second century, traditional trading
practices also were turned on their head, with a proliferation of free-lance
traders and handler of goods.  
  
At the same time, the threat of the shuddeni actually served to increase
factionalism in the Republic.  Different city-states offered varying
proposals for dealing with their defeated enemies.  Most supported some
variety of a containment policy, but more radical opinions ranged from
conciliation (often heard from those cities occupied by the shuddeni) to a
campaign of extermination (as advocated by extreme elements in the clergy of
Jolinn).  The political divisions over the \#shuddeni\# problem lead to
Earendam being forced to garrison fortresses such as Kor Thrandir with their
own troops and supplies, greatly weakening an already diminished military.

Earendam\@s rise to power is not the subject of this treatise, but it is
sufficient to know that those who associated with the ancient banner of the
blue and white rose brought with them more than force of arms, or powerful
magic.  With them rode the tide of culture, and the force of its coming
changed the face of Avendar.  
  
By the time of the War of Night, the Republic embraced most of the main
continent of Avendar, with ties to the mountain strongholds of the aelin,
and the more primitive ethron.  Moralists among the priests of Jolinn and
Iandir decried the onset of decadence in the people and the government of
Earendam.  With most frontiers closed, the eyes of Earendam turned inward,
desperately seeking some novelty, some new thing, to come from within.  
  
At the war\@s end, some predicted a new golden age for the Republic,
supported by the new magics of spirits and united by the threat of the
shuddeni.  Few counted on these very factors forming the foundation for the
fall of the Republic.

An excerpt from \#{WA History of Earendam the Grand: Portrait of a City and
its Times..\#{n
  
By Jofis Tabr, historian and scholar
  
The fortunes of Earendam in the centuries following the War of Night would
bring it from Republic to city-state, from feared to contented, and from
mythic to legendary.  And yet, despite its decline in fortunes, this city
was and continues to remain the heart of human culture in Avendar.  
  
Purported to have been founded after the War of Fire, it is certainly the
oldest known city founded by humans.  Beginning as a fishing village built
on the banks of the Dantaron, and near the shores of the Uthlin, Earendam
had long been a center for trade and council among primitive men, even
before the War of Fire.  
  
After the war, the human templars and sorcerers who had lead their people
against the aelin met with death and exiles.  The vast majority of humanity,
tired of war and conflict, settled with relative ease under the leadership
of the likes of Aramril and Salyra.

Unfortunately for the griffinriders, the other arm of the mercenary army
took the opportunity to attack the undefended Paelaran.  The tower was
sacked, burned, and razed, as the mercenaries prepared for the next battle. 
Returning to the city, the riders came upon the recently unprepared
mercenaries, and drove them into the Uthlin.  
  
Grief-stricken at the fate of their people, the griffinriders swore to
protect that region of the Uthlin for all time.  Unwilling to live in a
centralized location again, they took to living with the griffins that they
had trained, becoming a part of the ecosystem of the mountains.  
  
Today, the griffinriders mainly keep to themselves, but actively police the
area near the Uthlin and their section of the mountains, hunting wild game
to feed both themselves and the griffins they tend.  In most cases,
griffinriders are descendants of the nobility of Paelaran, although some
adventurers join their ranks after deeds of exceptional nobility and daring,
and after they have proven they can bond with the great griffins.
~
E
tome2~
One well known such territory is the barony of Krilin, which persists to
this day in the form of the city which bears the same name.  Another
territory lay on a mountainous spur of the Brintors, which jutted down along
the edge of the Uthlin.  Located near an old shuddeni outpost, it was
considered a perfect location for new fortifications.  And so it was that
the Duchy of Paelaran came into existence.  At first, the duchy flourished,
and its people lived in a tower on the coast of the Uthlin, trading and
fishing along the eastern part of the sea.  
  
The fortunes of the age were not with the people of Paelaran, though, and
their numbers dwindled.  A plague ravaged their tower city in the second
century after its founding, and a chilling of the climate in the region
ravaged their economy in the fourth.  During the first kankoran war,
Paelaran was captured and sacked by the main body of the kankoran horde, and
most of its people fled to Earendam.  In the chaos following the fall of the
Republic, Paelaran was abandoned for some time, but eventually resettled. 
It retained only a fraction of its former glory, and its halls lay empty. 
Lacking the population to support a standing army, the tower\@s remaining
nobility took up the very dangerous task of training the griffins who
roosted in the aeries near the city.  Little is known of the actual taming
of the beasts (as griffinriders even in the early days guarded their secrets
from outsiders), but it is suspected some power of air or spirit is
involved.  The griffinriders enjoyed a period of fame where they were the
stuff of legend, but Paelaran still lacked the citizenry to regain its
former glory.  
  
By the time of the third kankoran war, Earendam called upon the
griffinriders to help them in battle against a group of marauding human and
kankoran mercenaries in the hill country of the Rirro Jagka, further east of
the Uthlin and Earendam.  Discharging their ancient debt, the griffinriders
helped turn an even battle into a rout of the opposing forces.

In the centuries following the War of Night, the grand hopes of those who
sought a better world in the alliances formed in that great conflict were
sadly disappointed.  Most aelin only wanted to isolate themselves from the
world, having seen its effect on their own brethren in the person of
Serachel, and the devastation wrought by the war.  Ethron brokered a peace
with the Great Republic, receiving sovereignty over large forests such as
Qilarn in return for assurances that they would be left to their own
devices.  The Republic, whose resources and armies has been left in ruins by
the war, found worrying about peace somewhat unapropos in the middle of what
amounted to a protracted civil war with its provinces.  The ch\@taren, freed
from the threat of annihilation, and finding themselves in a completely new
world, reverted to their natures, and by and large scattered to the four
winds.  
   
The shining example of cooperation between the powers, Kor Thrandir, was
left as the only visible sign that they had once all been allies.  The
senate of Earendam, seeing that they were increasingly unable to maintain
direct control of holdings in the Brintors, decided to take action.  They
divided up the Brintors into several region, giving direct control to
nobility who would pay tribute and remain nominal vassals of Earendam. 
Along with these agreements, the nobility ceded the Brintors would maintain
the roads through the mountains, as well as acting to settle them whenever
possible, to act as a bulwark against any potential future shuddeni
incursions.

Unbeknownst to his mother, every Mettenday Chaith elm-Kalult had been
dabbling in fire majicks under the tutelage of a rogue Var Bandor fire
scholar instead of buying supplies for the household.  So, eager to practice
his newly learned skills (and cause mischief at the same time), Chaith
elm-Kalult jostled through the crowd of awed people until he was standing
directly behind Jorir\@s seated form and bushy tail.   
  
Giggling uncontrollably, and with visions of an enflamed, leaping and
howling Jorir in his head, Chaith elm-Kalult rubbed his thumb and forefinger
together.  But instead of producing a small flame between the fingers (which
would have then raced up Jorir\@s tail), a single small spark leapt from
Chaith elm-Kalult\@s fingers onto the spirit templar\@s tail, sizzling a
second or two before fading and dying.  
  
Now, Chaith elm-Kalult might not have been found out as the trickster,
even with his fingers leaking tell-tale curled smoke.  But the village of
Inessa had tired of Chaith elm-Kalult\@s mischief, so as one, drew back from
him to expose his misdeed. 
  
And hardly missing a beat in the flow of conversation with his Champion
brothers, Jorir turned, opened his mouth wide, revealing long, white sharp
teeth, and devoured Chaith elm-Kalult in one bite.  
  
  
{W                             THE END{n
~
E
book3~
Chaith elm-Kalult did not apologize for the incident, though.  He did not
even confess his misdeed and show true remorse by enrolling within the
School of Heroes to study as a peaceful true water scholar who wandered the
lands healing the sick and unfortunate.  Instead, Chaith elm-Kalult
snickered behind the barn as the Inessan elders tried to persuade the water
templar not to tell the Var Bandor Water Templar faction about Inessa\@s
unique way of recruiting ogre killers. 
  
So, no one was truly surprised when mischief befell Iyalisn M\@pryl, Lord
General of Aramril and Son of Jolinn, Zelenaes Vel\@taar, Warrior Pegasus and
Voice of Rystaia, and Jorir Tularnki, Wolf of Free and Blade of Girikha upon
one of their visits to Inessa.  The three Champions had just finished a
successful raid on the Halls of the Shunned Witches, and decided to rest for
a drink and sustenance at Nika\@s Inn on their return to the Golden Tower.  
  
Word of the three spirit templars present within the village spread like
plague, and every able-bodied man, woman and child crammed Nika\@s tiny bar
to get a glimpse of the three renown warriors of the Light and hear their
most recent tale of triumph for the cause.  Chaith elm-Kalult pushed his way
into the bar as well, for such close quarters were the perfect cover for
mischief.
~
E
book2~
\#There once was a little boy named Chaith elm-Kalult and all of Inessa
knew him to be the most mischievous child in the village.  Chaith elm-Kalult
was so mischievous, he had his mother sew a back pocket onto his grey
breeches for the sole reason of carrying mischief with him wherever he went.
Of course, Chaith elm-Kalult did not tell his mother this was the reason he
requested the back pocket.  Chaith elm-Kalult told his mother the back
pocket was needed to tote his monthly allowed coin for the sweemeats and
trinkets he bought when the wandering peddler brought his wares to the
village.  
    
At first, Chaith elm-Kalult\@s misdeeds were harmless.  Chaith elm-Kalult
would knock the warblers out of the Rowan Tree with his slingshot and feed
the injured birds to the Charcoal Burner\@s scrawny cats, or he would smear
little Tomik\@s wolf-pup with Anya\@s honey and hold his sides and laugh as
the pup chased his tail, trying to bite the enormous houseflies back. 
  
But eventually Chaith elm-Kalult grew bored of such misdeeds, and he
sought more mischievous ones.  Once, he added just a touch of hellebore
bought from Old Althea to the goats\@ feed, and Inessa couldn\@t stay off
their chamber-pots for a week.  Another time, he set a hidden bear trap
within the weeds directly beneath the ogre parchment tacked to the side of
the barn, and a water templar passing through bound for Port Gaald mangled
her left foot when she stepped closer to read the reward notice.  If not for
her guild knowledge in the Waters of Jolinn, the templar might have had her
trip delayed more than just half a day.

Whichever story is true (or not), Inessa was ogre-free from the day the
Hyacinthe Girl returned from the forest unharmed, until her timely death
seventy years later.  Villagers also say when the Hyacinthe Girl died (her
lips still stained raspberry, her cheeks smooth and her eyes still haunted
with silver moonlight) all hyacinthes from the Sea of Lidreau to Var Bandor
crumbled and wilted with her.  Some also say the ogre returned (knowing of
the death of the Hyacinthe Girl) to extract revenge upon the village which
harboured the girl who drove him to madness, insanity and eating dirt. 
Whichever story you believe, to this day villagers under the tutelage of the
druids of Eril attempt to grow magically-warded hyacinthes which never bloom
to maturity.  Other villagers have learned to hunt during seventy years
(passing along the knowledge to their children) and some have even been
successful at driving the ogre back to the northern cliffs for months on
end.  But as if for assurance or protection, on each hunt, the villagers
carry a single hyacinthe in his pouch naturally cultivated by Anya, in hopes
that somehow, someway, the spirit of the Hyacinthe Girl is still alive.
~
E
book5~
No one knows exactly how the Hyacinthe Girl rid Inessa of its ogre; she
insisted she wanted to face the ogre alone and assured the village she would
return without harm done to head nor foot.  Ask any villager (young and old)
to tell the tale and their answers will vary.  Some will say she warded the
village with self-grown hyacinthes planted on the outskirts where forest
melts into village path, wards that the ogre could not overcome nor overstep
no matter how persistent, driven in the opposite direction by madness and
confusion.  Others will say she exchanged words with the ogre (the Hyacinthe
Girl was supposedly quite proficient in ogre-tongue) and asked him in quiet,
civil, nightingale tones to leave Inessa and restrict his hunting to Morn. 
As the story goes, when the ogre refused, the Hyacinthe Girl took a
hyacinthe from a small but simple, worn herb pouch and gave it to the ogre. 
Smirking, the ogre attempted to crush, destroy and rid itself of the
hyacinthe and the Hyacinthe Girl, but to no avail.  The cursed and
ogre-warded hyacinthe eventually drove the ogre mad and into the higher
crests and cliffs north of Inessa where he gibbered, drooled and ate dirt
for sustenance years on end, nearly wasting to unimaginable frailty.  But
the story most villagers do not tell yet believe, is the Hyacinthe Girl
merely looked at the filthy ogre with her silver moonlit tinted eyes for a
moment, to the ogre, longer than eternity itself and the ogre fled.

No one was quite sure where the Hyacinthe Girl came from.  One chill autumn
morn she appeared in Inessa as if she walked there upon the red-gold rays of
the sun itself, her laugh like nightingale song, while she played and
frolicked with Tomik and his wolf-pup near the rowan tree.  Some of the
villagers believed her to be the daughter of muttering Old Althea of Morn,
for the Hyacinthe Girl was an herbalist like Inessa had never seen before
and probably will never see again.  Other villagers believed her to be the
love-child of a tryst between druid Rhuidar of the far northern mountains
and druidess Alisren of Nendor the powerful regenerative herblore of the
Hyacinthe Girl could rival some of the lesser water scholars and only a
druidess with such herblore would be taught that knowledge at the knee of
such powerful druid-parents.  Who the Hyacinthe Girl truly was not divined
and she wasnt telling when asked whence from she came she would tilt her
head teasingly and chuckled her nightingale-laugh as she responded, \@From
the forest.  \@
~
E
book2~
The Hyacinthe Girl was a truly beautiful creature and made the men of Inessa
quickly forget Anya and her supple deerskin leggings.  Her lips looked as if
she had been tasting raspberries all morn, her nose was as pert as a
toddling child, her wheat-blonde mussed hair was woven with hawthorn flowers
and juniper cone-berries, her stature was sleek, willowy and lithe and her
eyes--- well her eyes were certainly her most interesting feature.  
  
Most people were unsettled by the gaze of the Hyacinthe Girl and for good
colour of a moonlit forest at night.  If she were not smiling, if she were
seemingly pondering thoughts that kings, lord high generals and patricians
would only ponder, if she were gazing in the distance as if she were afraid
(or amused) the horizon would reach out and kiss her with a soft tenderness
on those raspberry-stained lips of hers, one thought insane violence was
ready to erupt from within, unleashed on whomever was about.  But if she
smiled at you, if she graced you with a lovely grin, well, you felt as if
you were the only in your world and hers and eternity with her had just
begun.
~
E
book3~
So, it was no wonder the village of Inessa quickly took to the Hyacinthe
Girl and welcomed her as one of their own.  When Arik the Tanner made his
daily walk to his shop every morning, he stopped not only to speak to Inessa
the rowan tree but to the Hyacinthe Girl also as she frolicked and played
with Tomik and his wolf-pup.  In turn, for the gratitude and the food and
sleeping pallet a different villager offered her each night, the Hyacinthe
Girl acted as their village healer, vanishing poison ivy rashes before the
villagers eyes, providing natural antidote and antiseptic for venom bites
from insect and reptile alike and even mixing the occasional herbal
concoctions for hang-over cures.  Yes, the village of Inessa took the
Hyacinthe Girl as one of her own and even adored her, as long as they didnt
look to long in her silver-moonlit shining eyes.  
  
But not long after the Hyacinthe Girl came to be one with the village of
Inessa, a forest ogre began to ravage the village and the surrounding areas.
The ogre was a filthy beast that smelled of sour, rotting things and took a
liking for young tender meat, not caring if the meat was of songbird,
wolf-pup, yearling or cooing infant.  With fear and anger on knitted brow
and coated with words of bravado, Inessa amassed its villagers to kill the
ogre.  Belarik the Smith even offered weapons and armor for the triumphant
one who returned to his smithy with the ogres head, an offer he made after
the ogre attempted to devour his son and the wolf-pup one dusky winter eve.
~
E
book4~
Of course, none were successful in their hunt.  Inessa was not a village of
warriors it was a village of tanners, masons, wheelwrights,
horticulturalists and homesteaders.  The villagers did not know how to hunt
and kill the ogre their hunting was limited to deer and the occasional rogue
silver-maned wolf that found the strange smells of the village curious and
enticing.  The villagers were not surprised when they saw their neighbours
and sons and fathers and uncles return without a vaguely head-shaped
blood-stained burlap sack or when some of those same neighbours and sons and
fathers and uncles returned maimed and mangled, or even without beating
hearts and blood coursing through veins.  But just the same, none were
surprised when the Hyacinthe Girl sought out the village elders and meekly
offered to rid Inessa of its ogre problem for nothing at all.  One long look
in her eyes and you knew she could rid the world of the moon if she so
wished.

{WTHE ALATHARYA{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
The alatharya are reputed to be the oldest of the sapient races of
Avendar, with a history stretching back to the dawn of time.  As legend has
it, the alatharya were once the chosen people of the gods - gifted with both
phenomenal strength and formiddable intellects.  Using these gifts, the
alatharya spread across the surface of Avendar, creating a civilization of
legendary proportions.  
  
For how long the alatharya remained as the masters of Avendar is unknown
- but they remained long enough for the ruins of their wondrous cities to
still occasionally be found here and there - monuments easily thousands of
years old.
  
Amidst this mythical setting, though, the alatharya were not destined to
remain the lords of the earth.  Using the magic that the gods had given
them, the alatharya grew mighty in both knowledge of Avendar and their study
of the planes and structure of the universe.  Unsatisfied, though, with the
limits the gods had placed on their power, the alatharya sought ...more.
~
E
book2~
Delving into the power that upheld the very firmament, the alatharya
began to tap the quintessence -- the source for both magic and the divine
planes, on which the gods dwelled.  But when the alatharya attempted to use
their newfound powers against the gods, they discovered the depths of their
folly.  Forging engines with which to bind and imprison the Pantheon, the
alatharya instead made their undoing.
  
Anticipating the hubris of their first creation, the gods turned the
schemes of the alatharya against themselves.  Great was the vengeance of the
gods the alatharya had scorned, and greater still was the punishment they
bore.  It is written that within the course of one year, not a single of the
their great cities or temples remained.  The great forces of magic were
split, in an event which historians now know as the Sundering.  No longer
bound as a single force, magic was free to run rampant across the surface of
Avendar in the form of torrential, earth-shattering storms.  Beings of
divine fury and unholy wrath were let slip from the heavens, ransacking and
destroying the creations of the alatharya.  
  
For the alatharya themselves, they bore the harshest punishment of all. 
Stripped of their intellect and wisdom, the alatharya found themselves
wandering the earth, no longer with the wit or ability to grasp the magic
which was the gift of the gods.
~
E
book3~
History loses all sight of the alatharya for a period of time, until they
are depicted in an early aelin text, which portrays them as nomadic savages,
living a bleak and furtive existence in pockets of Avendar.  Many had been
driven to the Broken Wastelands to the east, scraping out barbaric lives. 
  
The alatharya of today average about eight to nine feet in height, but no
longer have the magical or intellectual gifts of their forebears.  They are
known for their silver and gold-tinted hair, which is often in contrast to
their harsh demeanors and lives.  Alatharya are found all over the main
continent of Avendar, though they are most typically found as tribal
plainsmen, or in small bands in forests.  Heir to a heritage they cannot
comprehend, the alatharya now substitute their strength and size for the
magic and the gifts of the gods they have lost.

{WTHE AELIN{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
The aelin are a race of semiavian bipeds, gifted with the power of
flight.  One of Avendar\@s oldest sapient races, it is known the aelin were
the first race to come into its own following the Sundering and the fall of
the alatharya.
  
From the beginning, the aelin were a civilized people, seeking order and
creation to oppose the madness of the years following the Sundering.  Their
civilization reflected both this desire for order, along with the
predilections of their avian nature.  They built great cities, wrought out
of the sides of the great mountains they called home.  Freed from the chaos
of the magical storms that marked the Sundering\@s aftermath, they were able
to lead a propserous existence, finding pause for contemplation and thought.
  
The aelin were also a rather insular people; they shunned the lowlands
and valleys, whose primitive inhabitants they felt would taint the purity of
the aelin people.  This policy would prove in the end detrimental, however,
when the aelin became embroiled with what is now known as the War of Fire,
the first great conflict of Avendar following the Sundering.
~
E
book2~
Virtually ignored by the aelin, other races had sprung up in Avendar\@s
lowlands.  Among them, the reptilian srryn and the wingless humans allied
together to take the riches of the aelin culture.  With these two opposing
races, the aelin faced their greatest threat - foes armed with the magics of
fire.  Easily mastered and bringing instant returns, the humans rapidly
trained scholars and military leaders in the ways of the magic.  
  
The aelin marshalled the resources of their people -- the accumulated
wisdom of their own civilization, coupled with what artifacts and relics
they had recovered from the ruins of the ancient alatharya.  The war that
ensued was long and devestating to the surface of Avendar, resulting in a
conflict second only to the Sundering in its catastrophic effects.
  
It was not until a renegade group of humans, along with allies among the
aelin, brought about the return of the god Jolinn and the magics of the
seas, that the war turned in favor of the aelin.  With all these things, and
the aid of the mighty Titans, the aelin and what humans allied with them
were able to drive back the srryn to their swamps, ending the war in a
series of swift and final battles.
~
E
book3~
After the war, some predicted a period of aelin ascendancy.  And, for a
time it was so, as the aelin cities were still the only true centers for
thought and civilization in Avendar.  The humans, though, with their
prolific reproduction and more open culture, began to dominate the political
landscape of Avendar.  
  
The aelin were content to withdraw into their high cities, and become a
distant ally to the humans, shaping their ideas, but seldom intervening in
any large scale in human affairs.  
  
Exceptions exist, of course -- the chief one being the aelin\@s
intervention in driving back the shuddeni menace in the War of Night. 
Today, while some aelin do consent to dwell away from their homes in the
mountains and the clouds, most live far from the center of human
civilization, across the Sea of Lidraeu, content to dwell near their
capitol, Ilodaiya.  
  
Aelin are generally lean, with a height generally ranging within the
human norm.  Their features and bodies are both delicate, and aelin will
typically take great stock in what bloodlines or houses they are affiliated
with.  Their most striking feature, of course, are their wings, which are
feathered in the manner of avian kind.  Those aelin who do dwell among
humans typically occupy positions of authority, or at least influence and
wealth.

{WTHE SRRYN{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
The srryn are a race of humanoid reptiles.  Covered with a leathery,
scaled hide and naturally gifted with short whip-like tails, they are
cunning warriors and will often use their natural abilities to good
advantage.  
  
Mainly dwelling in the swamps and lowlands of Avendar, the srryn make
their living by trading the rare roots that grow in their homelands, along
with itinerant raids on whatever settlement lie close to their demesnes. 
The srryn have little of the formal amenities of government or oganization,
choosing instead to live in small villages in the swamps.  Srryn leadership
is usually determined by age, predicated on the assumption that no
incompetent lives long enough to come to power. 
  
Despite their primitive surroundings, the srryn are one of Avendar\@s
oldest races, with an origin shortly following the Sundering.  The earliest
written record of the srryn concerns raids by them on various aelin
settlements, and measures taken to combat them.
~
E
book2~
For a long period of time, the aelin viewed the srryn as hopeless
primitives, and viewed them more a nuisance than a threat.  Somewhere near
the high point of aelin dominance, however, events began to unfold which
would lead to the srryn not only becoming a potential threat, but also
potential rulers of all Avendar. 
  
Matters are unclear as to how or why the Srryn discovered the magics of fire
- perhaps the workings of a mad god, perhaps the primitive rituals of the
srryn shamans stumbled upon the right mystical combination to unlock the
power of flame.  However it came to be, this new magic turned the srryn from
a race of primitive and bickering warlords into a force to be reckoned with.
Cowing the humans who lived around them with both force of magic and the
promise of more power to come, the srryn began a series of campaigns to
unite their disparate forces.  The srryn and their human allies came against
the aelin with the suddeness and power of an inferno.
~
E
book3~
At first it seemed the aelin\@s mighty civilization would fall quickly, as
one by one their cities were overrun and put to the flame.  Once the aelin
realized the nature of the threat, however, they rallied their republic to
face the srryn.  Using the relics and weapons recovered from the ruins of
the ancient alatharya, the aelin fought let loose with a swift series of
counterstrikes, driving the srryn back to a stalemate. 
  
The stalemate, though, was an untenable one.  The srryn and humans were
both virile races, swelling in numbers to replace those who fell in battle. 
Furthermore, their magic was strong and new, and the aelin were slow to
renew themselves, and their success depend on the rapidly fading power of
ancient weapons and tools. 
  
In the end, the srryn lines did not break until entirely new forces came
into play.  Humans not under the sway of the srryn, with the aid of a daring
minority of the aelin, followed the clues of an ancient prophecy, journeying
to the northlands to awaken the god Jolinn.
~
E
book4~
Bringing with them the aid of the magics of water, human, aelin, and the
newly awakened Titans attacked the srryn warlords in the plains and lowlands
of Avendar.  A series of cataclysmic battles marked the end of the War of
Fire, as the desperate srryn and human forces tapped directly into the
elemental plane of fire, often drawing more power than they were capable of
safely channeling. 
  
The srryn and their allies lost these great battles, decimating their
forces and laying barren many of their homelands.  Defeated and hunted, the
srryn withdrew to the deepest swamps, hiding themselves from the victorious
forces of aelin.
  
For most of the rise of the humans and during the period in which the
Republic of Earendam held sway over most of Avendar, the srryn were a
relatively isolated people.  Content with the occasional raid or to waylay
what travellers who came into their power.  In the War of Night, the srryn
allied briefly with the shuddeni, but turned against them when they realized
the eyeless ones had no intention of sharing power with them.
~
E
book5~
This aid against the shuddeni brought the srryn some measure of
respectability, making them a more common sight in the cities of Avendar,
most usually as gladiators in fighting arenas, or gaining notoriety as
bandit kings with their own small parcels of territory.  No longer
universally feared, the srryn are still distrusted, and by no means ignored
by the other inhabants of Avendar.

{WTHE HUMANS{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
Humans are one of Avendar\@s most adaptable races, with at least some
humans living in most all of the land\@s various locales.  Humans trace their
origin to a time following the fall of the alatharya, with their first
civilizations appearing near the Dantaron river valley. 
  
The aelin provide the first written records of humanity, portraying them
as savages \@on the border of beginning a civilized existence\@.  The aelin
generally left the humans to themselves, though a few tribes seem to have
traded with smaller aelin cities. 
  
Humanity\@s progress towards a more settled mode of existence was
interrupted, however, by events in the lowlands of Avendar.  The srryn
appeared with the magics of fire, transforming them from a race of itinerant
raiders to potential warlords.  The humans were faced with a choice that was
none too difficult to the primitive mind -- ally with the srryn and their
magics, or be driven into forced servitude.
~
E
book2~
The humans proved apt pupils for the magics of fire, and with their aid,
the srryn brought upon the aelin the conflict that was known as the War of
Fire.  The war at first went extremely well for the srryn and their human
allies, with aelin cities toppling before the new and destructive magic of
fire.
  
Given time, however, the aelin organized a staunch resistance, rallying
their collection of ancient artifacts to aid them in battle.  At the same
time, the new human warlords gained a keener insight into the motivations of
the srryn, and so were less eager to sacrifice their own people when they
became aware of the srryn\@s rapacity.  Though the war still was in the favor
of the humans and the srryn, the pace and manner of their victories had
slowed, giving the aelin more time. 
  
It was this time which was the aelin\@s salvation.  A rogue band of the
humans, dissatisfied with a life of bloody conquest, departed from the main
body of the human forces, daring to seek protection from the aelin.  For
their part, the aelin were willing to accept the rogue humans, who offered
aid to the aelin in defending their cities.
~
E
book3~
The humans were to prove more useful to the aelin than just more
defenders for their city walls, however.  The scholars among the aelin had
access to the prophecies given in the last days of the alatharya, along with
the most potent of magical artifacts.  Forseeing destruction if any other
course were followed, the aelin sent the humans among them on a journey to
the frozen northlands.  This journey, now legendary, was made by the humans
to find and awaken the ancient god Jolinn, Lord of the Seas.  The journey is
recorded in detail in other texts [See Tyalin\@s work, The Quest of Aramril,
or the epic poem of the same name by the poet Quarentis], but suffice it to
say the humans were successful in their task, and as a consequence brought
the magics of water to Avendar.  Along with these new magics, the humans
also succeeding in enlisting the aid of the Titans, who agreed to return
with the humans to fight the srryn. 
  
With their newfound allies, the aelin fought a series of cataclysmic
battles, driving the srryn back to their swamps.  The leaders of the humans
who had joined with the srryn were all slain in battle, or executed by the
victorious forces.
~
E
book4~
The aelin cooperated with their human allies in creating a new human
government, with the heroes of the quest situated in key positions of power.
And, truth be told, most of the humans who had fought with the srryn had
done so under duress, and even those who had been eager for battle were now
in a position to appreciate the consequences of war.  Avendar\@s surface had
been ravaged by the last battles of the war, laying waste to fertile lands
and inundating barren deserts. 
  
The period following the war, however, was one of sustained prosperity. 
The humans established trade with the aelin, who were eager to have access
to the fertile natural resources of the lowlands.  In return, the humans had
a fondness for the mineral wealth of the mountains which were the home of
the aelin. 
  
Culturally, the humans were greatly influenced by the aelin\@s unique
style of government (the Republic), as well as the development of the magics
of earth - a gift of the caladaran, a people who came to the Dantaron valley
from the lands to the east.  These factors all lead to the development the
first of the great human cities, Earendam.
~
E
book5~
From Earendam grew what today we now know as the Republic of Earendam. 
The Republic became a mainstay of Avendar\@s political landscape, offering
protection and peace to numerous human kingdoms, which inevitably became
incorporated as provinces.  With the increasing human expansion, the aelin
seemed more inclined to isolate themselves.  To many, this marked the end of
the golden age of aelin civilization and the beginning of human dominance.
  
During the heyday of the Republic, the extent of territory was vast,
stretching from the icy wastes of the north to the southern sands, and
from the sea of Lidreau in the west to the Vorinden mountains in the east.  What
the leaders of the Republic had no way of realizing, however, was that
policy of unbridled expansion would emperil the very existence of their way
of life.  
  
Mining ever more deeply into the Brintors, humans eventually came upon
the subterranean world of the shuddeni.  Eyeless and unspeakably evil, the
shuddeni at first sought to establish diplomatic ties with the Republic,
attempting to insinuate themselves into surface life.  The decadence of life
in the Republic proved easily susceptible to the temptations of the
shuddeni, who brought with them the magics of the void.
~
E
book6~
And, when the shuddeni felt they had sufficiently infiltrated human
society, they brought their armies to the surface, passing unseen to a
hidden place in the Brintors, where they began their conquest.  Backed by
legions of their brute chaja slaves, the shuddeni also had the aid of
various demon lords, summoned to wreak havoc among their foes.
  
The first winter of the War of Night marked the beginning of the shuddeni
offensive.  Striking quickly, and under cover of night, they struck at the
human cities and settlements in the Brintors.  They brought with them the
magics of void, striking terror in the hearts of their opponents, who were
often sacrificed to the shuddeni\@s gods.  Taking advantage of the closing of
the passes into and out of the Brintors during winter, the shuddeni
fortified their new holdings, taking advantage of the delay afforded them by
the weather to move the bulk of their armies to the surface. 
  
Elsewhere in Avendar, the Republic had to cope with internal dissent from
humans with a vested interest in its fall.  The srryn, eager to take
advantage of the new threat, rallied for battle, harrying human forces as
they assembled to deal with the shuddeni menace.
~
E
book7~
With spring came an escalation of conflict, as the forces of Earendam met
the shuddeni army in a series of bloody battles.  Unused to fighting the
magics of the void and demonkind, the humans lost the first battles of the
war, often forced to flee far behind their own lines.  This continued for
the first two years of the war, with humans making only marginal gains
against the invaders.
  
Given time, though, the humans adapted to some of the shuddeni\@s battle
tactics.  After the second year of war, the humans began to hold their own
in the battles, if gaining very little net territory.  With the coming of
aelin warriors from across the sea, the humans seemed prepared to hold their
own for some time to come. 
  
Eager not to become drawn into a protracted war, the shuddeni turned once more 
to their dark magics.  Calling together the archmages, the shuddeni attempted a
great Summoning.  Whether the result was a magical accident or predestined
is a matter of ages\@ worth of debate, but what is known is that the human\@s
fortunes turned that day.  The ch\@taren poured through the great shuddeni
nexus, bringing the magics of spirit, and doom to the shuddeni forces.
~
E
book8~
Battles still remained to be fought, but with the aid of the ch\@taren and
their magic, the humans were able to systematically drive the shuddeni back
beneath the surface of Avendar.  
  
After the war, however, the Republic did not possess the same stength and
unity it once had.  Various provinces had been forced to fend for themselves
during the war, giving rise to a patchwork of independent states, each with
its own charismatic ruler who had lead it through the war.  Var Bandor, the city
nearest Earendam, severed its ties, recognizing Earendam as a trade rival
without the military forces to make firm its control.  In Gogoth, a king
ruled, refusing to turn control of his country\@s rich farmlands over to the
tax assessers of Earendam.  And, in the Brintors, the shuddeni still had
footholds here and there in the high places of the mountains.  
  
Despite these problems, the Republic continued as the reigning human
institution for the next two and a half centuries.  It was the kankoran who
rang the death knell for the Republic, invading from the icy wastes in the
north of Avendar.  Militarily and financially ill-equipped to defend against
what amounted to a full scale invasion, the senate was forced to withdraw
the armies of the Republic to the inlying provinces.  The kankoran horde
fought its way to Earendam itself until it met its final end.
~
E
book9~
After this period of barbarian invasion, the Republic underwent one final
collapse.  Coming under the leadership of a Patrician, Earendam became an
independent city state, finally severing its ties with eastern provinces it
could no longer protect, the northern outpost-fortresses which had become
highly isolated already, and trade monopolies in the Crimson Sands it could
no longer maintain.  
  
For a time, human society completely fragmented, with each city jealously
guarding its holdings against roving bandits.  In recent years, however,
humanity, while politically divided, has gained a certain strength in its
ability to cope and deal with Avendar\@s other races.  Less isolated than the
aelin, less violent than the kankoran, and less dangerous than the shuddeni,
the humans have succeeded both as diplomats and as rulers in many portions
of Avendar, leaving them still as the dominant race.

{WTHE CALADARAN{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
The caladaran are a peaceful people, given to contemplation of the ways
and nature of Avendar.  Tall and thin, with a stoney, bark-like skin, the
bodies of caladaran resemble walking sticks.  Their faces are more
humanoid,with most caladaran showing little signs of age for most of their
life.
  
Caladaran first appear in human records shortly before the formal
beginning of the Republic of Earendam.  First noted as wanderers from the
east and south, the caladaran brought with them the magics of earth, though
they also rapidly took to the healing arts which had so dominated following
the War of Fire.  The caladaran also brought with them the worship of
Iandir, who embodied the principles most of the caladaran lived by. 
Previously worshipped only as a noncorporeal force, the devotion to order
and Law became a religion among some humans, giving rise to the first
codified set of laws (laid down by the nobles of the aelin Ipsoli line) as
well as the written script used as the basis for the common tongue today.
~
E
book2~
For as long as caladaran have been known, they have served as teachers
and healers, though seldom as warriors or men of the sword.  Preferring a
solitary lifestyle, they will nevertheless live in cities or towns if it
suits their purposes (their healers in particular). 
  
Among themselves, the caladarans have a council of sages, which meets
infrequently and typically only over matters of grave importance, preferring
to let local rulers and laws deal with day to day problems.

{WTHE ETHRON{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
The ethron are a people indigenous to the forests and the woodlands of
Avendar.  First recorded by the historians of the first century of the
Republic, the ethron appeared as refugees, whose forests and homelands in
the south had been destroyed in the War of Fire.
  
The earliest contact between humans and ethron came when the then-king of
Gogoth deeded the forest of Qilarn to a large group of ethron, who in return
cleared the place of srryn and other undesirable forces.  It is from this
group that most of the ethrons known to the histories descend. 
  
Living in the great forest, the ethron made their homes in and above the
trees, bringing life to the forests that surrounded and protected them.  The
ethron also divided themself socially into clans, with a chief (usually
male) heading the people of a given region.
~
E
book2~
The ethron also proved to be a gregarious and robust people, friendly
with those who were willing to trade or make peace with them.  Often allies
of the humans of Earendam and the surrounding regions, the ethron were often
equally fierce opponents of the srryn and shuddeni, opposing the latter in
the War of Night.  
  
Physically, the ethron are short and stocky, averaging about five feet in
height.  Most notable is their skin, which is a striking shade of green,
often matching the leaves and undergrowth of the forests in which they make
their homes.  A vital, strong people, the ethron are known for their staunch
bravery.

{WTHE SHUDDENI{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
The shuddeni are a subterranean race, living in underground cities far
below the surface of Avendar.  Shuddeni appear as extremely thin humanoids
with ashen gray skin, absolutely lacking in all body hair.  Most distinctive
about the shuddeni, though, is the complete absence of eyes.  In the place
of the orbs of the eye, shuddeni have nothing but a slight indentation of
smooth flesh.  Rather than seeing in the conventional sense, the shuddeni
have some other way of detecting shape and essences. 
  
Most of shuddeni culture revolves around life in their cities, which were
originally formed by successful families, or Septs as they are now known, of
shuddeni.  In time, the holds of the Septs acommodated allies of the family,
until they eventually became large enough to sustain themselves independent.
  
Today, shuddeni cities are governed by a ruling caste of priests, who
maintain their power through the use of magic and command of the lion\@s
share of the city resources.  Shuddeni guard their cities with the aid of
the chaja, a race of massive slaves.  Shuddeni cities will occassionally
ally themselves with one another, but bloody disputes have been known to
erupt over matters of territory or itinerant raiding.
~
E
book2~
Human contact with the shuddeni occured in the years prior to the War of
Night, when mining expeditions in the Brintors revealed a passage to
Yithoul, one of the largest of the shuddeni cities.  After several initial
ventures there met their end, the shuddeni established a gradual
relationship with the Republic.
  
What the senate did not know was that these initial peace overtures were
merely the first step in a massive shuddeni campaign of conquest for the
surface world.  Extending their power to certain groups not in favor under
the policies of the Republic (Srryn and humans willing to practice forbidden
magic among them), the shuddeni began to ally themselves with these
factions.  
  
When the shuddeni burst to the surface, they brought with them their most
potent weapon -- the magic which drew on the negative energies of the void,
binding demons and horrific plagues.  The shuddeni had with them their
savage chaja slaves, who formed the bulk of their fighting forces, along
with their trained swordmasters, all wielding the dark blades of their kind.
~
E
book3~
On the surface, srryn turned against the Republic, along with small
pockets of human rebellion, particularly among scholars.  The shuddeni
boiled to the surface, rapidly consolidating a foothold in the Brintors and
the northlands.  Once secure, the shuddeni conquest became a less rapid tide,
if seemingly just as certain. 
  
The humans and their allies began to fight in desperation, attempting at
least a holding action against the shuddeni.  The Republic\@s fortunes seemed
to be taking a turn for the worse, with each step forward followed by two
steps backward.  The shuddeni, though, were not content with a lengthy and
protracted war.  They were eager to take possession of a land not denuded by
the consequences of war.  They wanted a swift victory -- and took steps to
ensure it. 
  
Drawing together the greatest archmages of the void, the shuddeni sought
to create an immense nexus to the void.  The gateway was to open for three
days, to bring through and bind the largest and most powerful of demons, for
use in one final assault on Earendam.  The result of their Summoning,
however, was not what they intended.  Instead of an army of demons, they
brought through a great host of ch\@taren, refugees from an outer plane.
~
E
book4~
The ch\@taren, desperate to escape perceived threat, broke through the
lines of the shuddeni, and fought their way to the surfaces with the aid of
human slaves.  Using the magics of spirit and their numbers, the ch\@taren
brought the War of Night to the swift end that the shuddeni had hoped for --
with a victory for the Republic and the forces of the light. 
  
The shuddeni were defeated, but still a threat.  Some shuddeni remained
in strongholds in the Brintors, proving too entrenched to easily removed
without considerable loss of life.  The main shuddeni tunnels to the surface
were walled off, preventing the easy passage of large bodies of shuddeni.
~
E
book5~
In the centuries following the War, the shuddeni took advantages of the
weakening of the human Republic to cultivate a more favorable attitude
toward them on the surface.  Still feared, some shuddeni became known for
their scholarly works, providing magical transportation across Avendar. 
Others cultivated their reputation as exotic bards, convincing noblemen of
the artistic merits of the bizarre shuddeni musical scales. 
  
In time, some shuddeni came to find permanent homes on the surface, still
mistrusted but accepted as a necessary evil in troubled times.  Below the
surface, some shuddeni still scheme, plotting a return of conquest, viewing
themselves as predestined rulers of Avendar.

{WTHE NEFORTU{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
The nefortu make their homes in the caves and low places of Avendar,
living away from the bright Avendarian days.  The first real contact between
nefortu and the surface began in the War of Night, when they were employed
by the shuddeni as assassins and thieves.  
  
With the victory of the light, the nefortu were quick to turn on their
shuddeni allies, gaining respectability in hunting and driving the shuddeni
out of the caverns nearest the surface.  Noting the opportunity for profit
in dealing with the surface, the nefortu established colonies and trade
routes there, causing their people to flourish.
  
The nefortu, already a fragmented people, often lack any unified system
of government or civilization.  They are, however, almost universally
crafty, and skill in deception or wit is often taken as a mark of respect
among their people.  Old religions devoted to spirits of air and fire still
persist among their people, though most now ascribe to more modern
deity-worship.
~
E
book2~
Physically, the nefortu are rather small, with heights usually on the low
end of five feet, on average.  Their bodies are slender and nimble, with
leathery wings and bat-like faces (though some have compared their snouts to
those of dogs) augmenting their relatively frail strength.  Nefortu prefer
caves or dark places as residence, but some have integrated into Avendarian
society as traders (or thieves), and can be found in many of Avendar\@s
larger cities.

{WTHE CH\@TAREN{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
The ch\@taren are the most recent race to come to the attention of
scholars, first appearing in the latter parts of the War of Night.  The
original home of the ch\@taren is unknown, and the ch\@taren themselves do not
speak of it, other than to describe themselves as \@refugees\@.  What is known
is that the ch\@taren exploited what is perhaps the greatest Summoning in
Avendar\@s history in order to enter this plane of existence.  The shuddeni,
seeking to bring an end to the War of Night, had attemped to create a
long-term nexus to the Void.  Instead of an army of demons from the Void,
however, the shuddeni inadvertently conjured an army of the ch\@taren, who
had adapted the shuddeni\@s spell to bring them to the prime material.  The
ch\@taren brought with them the magics of spirit, and the worship of the
goddess Rystaia, and served as a galvanizing force in the final defeat of
the shuddeni.
~
E
book2~
The ch\@taren appear as semi-translucent beings, roughly humanoid in form,
with some combination of gold skin and silver hair.  Not quite of our plane,
material objects will sometimes pass through a ch\@taren, making them
difficult to capture or slay with mundane weapons.  Contrawise, some tie to
the ethereal plane makes them susceptible to magical energies.  
  
As a people, the ch\@taren are a carefree and merry lot, seldom troubled
by the affairs of the world at large.  What societal structure they
originally had is largely lost, as the ch\@taren tend to be flexible enough
to adapt to the government or culture of the people around them.  Most
ch\@taren do not lead settled lives, taking up an adventurous mindset for at
least some portion of their youth.

{WTHE KANKORAN{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
The kankoran are a fierce and savage people, descended from the ancient
wolves.  Taller than average human height, kankorans appear as heavily
furred wolf-men, complete with savage jaws and lupine demeanor.  They have
no tails (or at the most a very vestigial stub) and prehensile, padded hands
with claws and opposable thumbs.  Strong and hearty, they are relentless
warriors, more skilled with the ways of weapons than with what dabbling they
have in the magical arts.
  
Kankorans appeared in the annals of early aelin explorers, as well as the
records of the early Republic.  They do not figure significantly, however -
mainly as savages living in distant and frozen lands in the far north.  It
was not until the years following the War of Night that the kankorans came
with any numbers into the lands of the south.  
  
Driven by some unknown force, red-furred kankorans began a long and
protracted series of raids along the borderlands of the Republic.  Gathering
momentum along the way, the kankorans formed into a rampaging horde, rapidly
sweeping through the already weakened provinces of Earendam, looting and
pillaging along the way.
~
E
book2~
This spree was not stopped until the kankorans reached the very gates of
Earendam itself.  The Republic was victorious over the kankorans, but the
victory was a painful one -- with no one to hold the reins over the
surrounding territory, the political landscape of Avendar fractured, leaving
power vacuums here and there.
  
It was in the more northern reaches that a second wave of migrant
kankorans arrived, brown, rather than red-furred.  Victims of the long
winters which had driven the earlier kankorans south, these wolf-men were
more willing to share hunting grounds with the war-ravaged humans.  Trading
the fur and hides of their kills with hard-pressed human settlements, they
carved a niche for themselves in the mainstay of Avendarian life.  It is
rumored that the red-furred kankoran withdrew to the extreme northlands or
far, far across the eastern seas.
~
E
book3~
Kankoran society is chiefly structured around packs of nomadic tribes,
usually headed by the strongest and most powerful male of the pack. 
Occasionally, in times of crisis, or under the leadership of a truly
powerful or charismatic male, one pack will rise to dominance over the
surrounding packs, forming them into a horde.  A mainstay of kankoran life
is their religion, which views their gods as manifestations of ancient wolf
spirits -- a practice bordering on ancestor worship.  More lately, devotion
to the wind goddess Girikha has largely replaced this worship of the dead,
though the fallen are still regarded with heavy respect and superstition. 
  
Kankoran are seldom bound by any sort of law or rule, save the very
primitive behaviors that typify behavior in the pack.  In more recent times,
the kankoran peoples have spread through Avendar, and one may even find them
occasionally walking the streets of Earendam or Var Bandor, though those who
leave their pack are still the exception and not the rule.

{WThe Melody of the Songbird{n
by Cifete Elath-del the Songbird, Sister of Yamr, Follower of Alajial
  
Preface:
  
It is true, yes, I have harboured hatred, murderous intent, jealousy, scorn
and bitter passive anger within my heart for my sister Huidae.  It is also
true I have at one time wished to do murder against my sister, I wished to
take blade to her throat and slice deeply.  And yes, it is true as well I
have wished for, prayed for, begged for fame, notoriety and recognition as a
bardess--- as the songbird-bardess.  Truth be known I prayed to Lord
Serachel, I begged Lord Serachel, I wished Lord Serachel would manipulate
mind and dream, heart and soul that I would find fame, fortune and notoriety
that rivals Huidae\@s status as one of the Laughing Wolf Players.  
  
And then along comes my conscience.  
  
Mai\@lyraea, my guildmistress, decided to broker a deal for me that granted
wish, prayer and plea.  My soul-lit guildmistress decided to find faith in
my work, my person, my heart and my soul--- an ability that not even my
parents or sister has.  How can I still seek the Fallen One?  How can I,
with good conscience, seek out the silvery-winged god when my wishes have
been granted?  How can I?  , I step back and ask myself.  
  
Because the Fallen One offers gifts and I am a greedy, gift-taking bitch-of-
a-girl.
~
E
book2~
\@And then along comes my conscience.  \@
  
I did not believe those words would define my life so.  Seeking the Fallen
One is done with; it is in the past and gone, an embarrassed goal, desire,
wish that will not be spoken of to all but known to those trusted to me and
who need to know my story.  My freckles colour blood red with shame when I
think if that once-wanted goal.  I found no true pleasure in seeking a god
who promises gifts for soul.  Pleasure is found with the bleeding of my
pen\@s ink; pleasure is found when patrons smile and thank me for the
commissioned works I pen for them.  And even, pleasure is found in my recent
altruism---dedicating my commissioned coin to altruistic projects such as
the orphanage Teris is attempting to found, to say the least.  
  
\@And then along came my conscience.  \@ That phrase has turned me, has spun
me, has driven me to seek to remove the stain of my heart and the altruistic
Order of the Sisters of Yamr.  I shall find my way amongst them, I shall
remove the stain from my heart, I shall give with coin and word.  
  
I shall be truly happy for the first time since I entered a world thought
cruel.

{WChapter 1: Peace{n
  
About the lands they call me the songbird.  My songs are known far and wide,
and even amongst a select few elite and rich within Earendam, my tales are
purchased and read as well.  I am a profitable bardess; not many in my
profession can make such a claim.  I need not adventure to supplement my
income, to put food and drink within my belly.  And mind you, these are not
words of a braggart; these are words of truth.  But yet, I am not totally
whole, I am not wholly happy.  I find that violence and despair, evil deeds
and deceit bother me, those things sadden me.  So, I have taken the pledge
of providing for the poor and hungry, of aiding the downtrodden and lowly. 
I have taken the pledge of peace and compassion.  I have taken up the tenets
of Lady Alajial.  
  
I have taken steps to make a world I entered and thought cruel a more
peaceful compassionate place.  It is true that I made efforts to negotiate a
peace settlement between the Tower of Aramril and the Halls of Law.  It is
also true that peace has officially been declared between the two factions. 
But one can argue that my efforts did not necessarily result in the peace
settlement.  And I am fine with that.  That sits well with me.  Why? 
Because I live my life as the Lady Alajial has decreed, I live my life in
step with the Sisters of Yamr.  And now, my life shapes into a whole where
happiness radiates from the center.
~
E
book4~
{WChapter 2: The Circle Closes{n
  
Peace did not bring me happiness.  It brought me discontent.  Altruism did
not bring me happiness.  It brought me poverty.  Nor did compassion bring me
happiness.  It brought me jealousy.  Happiness and contentment was slitting
the throat of a Bandor street urchin just as the town crier rings the city
bells marking a new day made from the one before.  Happiness was using
Rystaia\@s own Deshmin and his wrath-imbued silver dagger to slit the throat
of a Bandor street urchin just as the town crier rings the city bells
marking a new day made from the one before.  Happiness was drinking,
gulping, swallowing greedily the sweet, last dying breath of a Bandor street
urchin as blood spurted onto my tunic and skirt.  Happiness was penning a
scroll of bold lies and subtle deceptions Happiness was garnering pledges of
revenge, pledges made of a scroll of bold lies and subtle deception. 
Happiness was slander and libel; happiness was making the Templar of Freedom
into the Cur of the Dog of the Skies.  Happiness was and is all of these
things, yes.  But true happiness is seeking the Fallen One and being blessed
with his gifts.  I am nearly there.  Life will be fulfilling.  The ends
meet.  The circle closes.

This ancient text is crackling and yellowed with age.  The curling script
which covers the pages is oddly archaic, spindly and thin.  Many of the \@s\@s
are long and distorted, far more similar in appearance to \@f\@s.  The book
deals with several obscure points of the war of fire, seemingly written by
an aelin lieutenant at the time.  Somewhat rambling and vaguely academic in
nature, the book has one particularly lucid passage: 

{WKILLING fRRYN{n
  
Af the grate armief of the frryn rife like a tyde of evil
itfelf, we are findinge ourfelvef hard-preffed to holde unto
our owne.  Verily, it haf come into mine mind to compofe a

----------------
The moft efficaciouf weapon yet known to our aelinkind if the
jawf of a grate and puiffant beaft from the northern waftes

The reafonf for the favagef\@ diflike of the cold is unfure;

{WCHAPTER ONE - BASIC WEAPONS CARE AND MAINTENANCE{n
  
In this dangerous world, every adventurer will need a weapon
of some kind.  There is almost no way around this.
  
Mortalkind has an incredible amount of innovative energy when
it comes to devising tools of destruction and pain.  As such,
weapons may come in all shapes and sizes.  However, for any
weapon, follow these basic intructions:
  
  {yMetal{n: Keep all metal parts dry and clean whenever
  possible!  A -light- coating of oil helps to prevent
  rust and allows for easier drawing in certain circum-
  stances.  Too much oil will collect dirt and grit, so
  use it sparingly.
    Sharpen the edges of your blade when necessary - bear
  in mind that certain weapons (axes especially) function
  optimally -without- a razor edge, so sharpen accordingly.
  Use an oiled whetstone, running the edge along the stone
  at a fifteen-degree angle as though you were trying to
  shave it smooth.  Be sure to whet each side of a blade
  -equally-, as failure to do so can ruin an edge.
    In the event of rust, scour the blade with steel cotton,
  or a handful of sand in a pinch.  The tiny rust animals
  grow in reddish-orange colonies in the metal, and can
  reproduce quickly if not completely eradicated. Re-oil
  afterwards.

~
E
book3~
{yWood{n: Keep wood clean and dry.  Watch for splinters.
  A small splinter can turn into a jagged dagger in a heated
  battle if it catches an edge in the wrong manner.  Sometimes
  polishing or sealing the weapon with pine-varnish or other
  glaze will not only help to harden the handle against
  splintering, but also weatherproof it as well.
  
  {yRope{n: All rope should be replaced regularly.  Whips
  especially are prone to fraying, as the terrific noise
  they make angers the air spirits and wears the whip into
  pieces.
  
  {yLeather{n: Keep all leather well-oiled with animal fat
  or other grease.  Take care that leather kept in constant
  contact with your body absorbs the salts, and the combin-
  ation of the grease and salt attracts animals, especially
  skunks.  Many adventurers have died due to equipment failure
  caused by inattention to these gnawing rodents - keep your
  gear close at hand while sleeping!

~
E
book4~
{WCHAPTER TWO - SIMPLE KNOTS AND ROPE USE{n
  
Many unfortunate deaths may be prevented through judicious use of rope
and tethers.  However, if one does not know how to properly apply these
they can be as deadly or inhibiting as not having them.
  
*Several complex sets of instructions and diagrams about knots follow*
  
Ropes are often useful while scaling cliffs, crossing ice, or exploring
caves.  Attaching yourself to a trusted friend may often save one in the
event of a fall.  See the following examples of good and bad harness use:
  
*Several confusing diagrams of knotted and cobbled harnesses follow,
drawn on crude stick figures.*
~
E
book5~
{WCHAPTER THREE - SAFE FOOD AND SUSTENANCE{n
  
To be brief, the safest method of obtaining sustenance is to buy it
at trusted mercantile locations in the cities.  With the exception
of dishonest merchants, over-long shelf times, or malicious assassins,
this is a perfectly reliable option.
  
The second best bet for proper food which is both safe and nutritious
lies in finding a reliable water scholar or templar.  Both tasty and
nourishing, the meals they can provide are a good choice for any
adventurer.
  
If you absolutely must forage for food, do not do so without consulting
a qualified hierophant or ranger.  Tasting items in small amounts and
waiting a certain period of time is usually a good idea.  Here follows
a basic checklist for scrounged food:
  
  {y-{n Most fruits are the safest parts of plants to eat, though 
  nothing is guaranteed in Avendar.

{WCHAPTER FOUR - PROPER ARMOR{n
                  
Armor is also another indisposable essential to the survival-liking
adventurer.  Whether its protections be magical or physical, having
something between yourself and nasty, painful things is a must.
  
Make sure your armor is in good condition.  Air it out in sunlight
when possible (unless its virtue lies in it being wet, or if it is
made from voidstuffs, or if it is -made- from sunlight).  For futher
direction to maintenance, see Chapter One.
  
When dressing, it is best to have a friend help.  Most wounds come
through interstices and gaps in one\@s armor.  Swordmasters and assa-
ssins are notorious for taking advantage of this.  
  
Start with a thick, padded underlayer.  This will help distribute the
force of blows and reduce chafing.  A good solid mail layer next helps
breathability and prevents the overaccumulation of too much sweat, as
well as stopping a blow which might otherwise slip between conventional
armor.
  
Atop this should go the heavier plate-style armors.  Make sure every
piece is well-secured, but not too tight.  A stiff elbowguard or loose,
hanging pauldron can mean instant or unpleasant death.

{WMEMOIRS OF CHILRAC d\@NARIOS{n
   
   
I\@ve been told that for some couples it is like souls coming together 
 and matching. A time of bliss and understanding between two different
 people. Looking back I don\@t think my parents ever got to that point.
 My father had nothing in common with my mother and in fact they were
 practically born enemies. Father was a soldier for the Earendam city
 guard, content to give his life away to uphold the laws and peace
 within the city. He had served for over two decades when he met my 
 mother.
  
The guard was raiding the catacombs beneath the city in another attempt
 to clear out the rabble that resided beneath the feet of law abiding
 citizens. In this excursion the guards managed to get all the way to
 the inn before the rabble pushed them back out above the streets.
 Those that have nowhere else to go can be desperate when their
 freedom is threatened. But the guards did not leave empty handed,
 they took over twenty people to fill their prisons and in some cases
 to fill their gibbets. Among those twenty was a young dancer, an 
 orphan working in the inn. She would become my mother.
  
My father had been the one to take her and her dancing partner into
 custody. Supposedly when he first saw her he fell in what he called
 \#love\#. Later on he realized it was merely lust, after all my mother
 was beautiful even by the standards of courtiers. He went to his
 Captain and convinced him to let her go, citing that she was innocent
 and had nowhere else to go. This was the first case of my father
 bending the laws to his own whim and its also how my mother became
 married, a condition set by the Captain for her release.
~
E
tome2~
Their first fourth months were happy or so my father tells me. But 
 once she realized she was pregnant things began to go awry. While my
 mother willingly married my father it was not out of love but
 desperation. I think my father realized this and never fully trusted
 her, rarely letting her out of the house and beating her if he came
 back from his shift and found her gone. So when she became pregnant
 my father had serious doubts about the father of the child.
  
In a rare moment of trust he decided to believe that he was the father
 and didn\@t throw her onto the streets, but this did not stop the 
 beatings. So I came to term bearing the blunt of his fists, my father
 did not care where he hit my mother so long as she felt pain and 
 guilt. Her face and her swollen stomach suffered much, and with 
 her I suffered.
  
My birth killed my mother, the midwife thought it had to do with the
 massive bruised and contusions that covered her body. I\@ve been told
 that my father had nothing to say to this, perhaps still in shock
 from seeing his wife die and the bruises that I came into the world
 with. Yes I entered this world battered and bruised, beaten by a 
 jealous father. I am forever thankfull that my father never broke the
 soft bones in my body, if he had I would not be alive today.
 I still bear the marks of fists, faded to a deep red; they cover my 
 torso and my skull. They are an eternal reminder for myself and my father.
~
E
tome3~
I am not sure if my father ever grieved for mother, if he did I never
 saw it. After my birth he threw himself into his duty, leaving me for
 days at a time in the care of another soldiers wife. They were a 
 pleasant couple, unable to have children of their own, so they treated
 me well and for a time I could be happy. But when my father came I 
 always trembled.
  
He treated me like a recruit to the guard, driving me to become stronger
 and yelling at me for hours about the law and why it is important. 
 Strangely enough I did not reject these teachings, indeed I took them 
 to heart. So I grew up, indoctrinated by the law in a house forsaken 
 of love, gaining brief glimpses of what life could be when I visited 
 that other couple. It has always pained me that I could not remember 
 their names.
  
I trained for years upon years untill finally I was confident enough 
 to take on my father. We fought with wooden practice staffs in the guards\@
 training yards. We had both grown older, but I had grown into youth,
 he into old age. It did not take long to disarm him and trip him to 
 the ground, both of us heaving for breath, the tip of my staff poised 
 above his throat. I threw the staff away and bent down near his face. 
 \#I would kill you if I could father, for you are an evil man. But that
 would break that laws that civilization is based upon and I will not 
 do that. But I will always watch, father and someday you may forget that
 I am there and then I will have justice.\# So I turned away and left,
 walking towards the tower of testing ready to prove myself.

                    A brief record of his early life,
             as gathered through interview and investigation
~
E
treatise2~
Irssanis and Osai Jadamsal, children of Gadlassis and Irtenni Jadamsal,
were always somehow ..  Closer than the rest of their siblings.  An inherent
understanding seemed to spring between them from the beginning.  The twins
were scarcely separable, often mutually in trouble for mischief caused by
Irsannis, the younger of the two.  Born and raised in Eril Village, the two
have five siblings, all raised in a warm and loving household by two
intelligent caladaran, one a farmer, the other a minor scholar of water.  
  
Irssanis, younger by two hours and taller by two heads, has always been the
more reckless (by caladaran standards).  Garrulous, daring, and awkward, his
sometimes bumbling exploits would often land him into trouble as a child and
an adolescent.  Coming from an especially peace-loving family and a race of
dispassioned sages, Irssanis was often alienated by his impulsive nature. 
Osai alone (with the occasional exception of a perceptive, sensitive mother)
seemed to always be the only one who could, with a quiet word and a
fraternal grin, soothe the fractious, gangly boy and lead him back to more
accepted activities.  
  
Their paternal grandfather, a venerated sage among the caladaran elders of
the village, taught the boys from an early age of the value of assiduous
study, a firm ethical base, and proper chivalric ideals.  The pair spent
quite a fair amount of time with their grandfather throughout their early
years, the young growing with the experiences of the old, and the senescent
re-living his golden years both with and through the children.
~
E
treatise3~
Many of those who walk the paths of this life are bent and wearied with the
burdens of survival and struggle to maintain that most necessary trait of
hope, a precious few are privileged enough to be free of them, even for a
short time.  While the world around them reeled with turmoil and the
neverending strife which makes the Crucible of Legends so deserving of its
name, these two were fortunate.  Irssanis and Osai were blessed enough to
have not only a family which loved and supported them, but one which was
also able to insulate and nurture the pair against the evils and woes that
mark mortal existence; and yet also to do so -without- leaving them naive
and unprepared to confront the cruelties and vagaries of life.  In such a
manner the caladaran grew, and learned, and prepared to set out to make
their own mark, to rise as adventurers and to build upon the carefully-laid
foundations handed down to them.

They were moving on led by the swordman Vron,
A mighty kankoran blade.
A gladiator from down south said word of mouth,
In the pits his fortune made
  
When round the bend near a forest glen,
They saw a well-cloaked man.
Vron did say, \#You are in the way,
Allow us pass, please, if you can.\#
  
\#Oho ho ho, I\@m afraid I must say no.\#
Old targent Vron was told,
\#I\@ve to collect a tax, and I shan\@t be lax.
A tithe in loot and gold!\#
  
\#A bandit we\@re meetin\@? I\@ll give you a beatin\@\#,
Said the kankoran fighter Vron.
\#I\@ve honed my skill in the art of the kill,
And soon you\@ll be dead and gone\#.
~
E
manuscript3~
\#You\@re done my friend, I\@m \@fraid this is the end\#
And with a thrust he lunged on in.
But he hit naught but air, he wasn\@t there,
And the fight then did begin.
  
Weapons clashed, and the merchants gasped,
And clutched their goods afraid,
As thrusts did fly and were parried by,
A gaily tasseled rapier-blade.
   
Vron did wheeze in the winter breeze,
And he knew his fate was made.
\#I may be through, but who are you?\#
\#The Red Bandit, the Crimson Blade!\#
  
A hush fell over, then, the mountin glen,
As the Bandit-fiend they saw.
\#I\@ll spare th\@lives you hold for thine precious gold,
And leave you to the thaw.\#
~
E
manuscript4~
Vron cried \#Nay!\# and dived back into the fray.
Swinging wildly his spear,
With a crimson flash, the spear lay in the grass.
Vron looking at his hands in fear.
  
The weapon he took while Vron could only look.
At the fearsome Highway-man.
\#I\@ll take thine spear as tithe, but spare thine life,
learn from this if you can!\#
  
And then he was gone and we did move on,
He vanished to his hidden lair.
But to the day, we don\@t go that way,
Lest we again find him there
  
So a lesson of dread, for those who tread,
In the Brintor mountains so old.
If in the path you\@ve made, you see the Crimson Blade,
Just hand over your gold.

On the Form of the Serpent
It has been oft rumored amongst the master bladesmen of Yithoul that
the form of the Serpent holds within its intricasies a relation 
closer to the Void than any other form, save that of the Dragon. It
is no irony, in truth, that it has been adopted in name, if not in
in practice, by the Company of the Serpent. 
  
When examining the form, then, it is best to begin by examining the
creatures and environments from which all forms derive their names. 
REEDS, striking upward at the belly of the BOAR, and at the legs of
the BULL. The MONGOOSE is its enemy, said creature bred to pounce
upon the serpent, biting at its neck and laying it low. 
  
Cousin to the ASP, the serpent is both lesser and greater. A simple
form for a swordmaster to enter and maintain, it serves for some as
a training stance. However, for those who know its secret, as a way 
to defeat and pass through the REEDs, it becomes invaluable.

             Maelstefas the Lord High General, Traitor to the Coven

One of the more controversial figures in Avendar\@s history, Maelstefas made
enemies as a farmer might make ears of corn.  Originally of Var Bandor
(although there is some dispute over this, as some scholars note that
Earendam was a spawn ing ground for members of the Coven of the Shunned in
his age), Maelstefas was trained as a fighter.  He was skilled in his craft
and those that could stand against him were relatively few in number (Though
certainly not nonexistent.  To mention two: a potent kankoran bladesman
with swords of lightning would often fight him to a standstill, and the
legendary earth templar Ranorin laid the General low on occasion.)  .  His
ruthlessness and martial prowess eventually led him to serve among the
Shunned.  A contemporary of the Demon-Scholar Yurhari (Before the void
scholar\@s apotheosis, however) and the ancient and feared barbarian srryn
Shasarik, Maelstefas aided insowing terror and fear among the goodly
people of Avendar, slaying many until the intervention of a Champion in a
most unlikely manner.  
~
E
scroll2~
The name of the woman whom I refer to is a matter of debate amongst
learned circles.  Iliandra is one supposition, as is Ilyoista.  What little
is known for sure, however, is that she was an aelin templar of the spirit,
a branded follower of Jolinn and a skilled warrioress.  She and Maelstefas
clashed in combat in the Brintor mountains, and Maelstefas was defeated. 
(The reason, it is believed, was hubris more than anything else.  The
General vastly underestimated his foe and paid accordingly.)  However,
wholly unexpected mercy from the templar as well as an attraction for the
woman caused Maestefas to question his path.  For a year they met in secret
and eventually the General began to secretly aid the cause of good.  

Eventually the betrayal was revealed (How, it is not known) and Maelstefas
was forced to flee the Halls, fighting back the fearsome pair of Shasarik
and Yurhari long enough to escape.  He then aided the light openly, but not
without incident.  He was distrusted with good reason by both light and
dark.  
~
E
scroll3~
Maelstefas went on to aid the forces of light in stopping the plot of the
dastardly cult (self-titled as the \@Spawn of Sothmogga\@) to free their
Master and destroy the Titans, joining a grand alliance of famed champions
of goodness.  Of course, their defense was successful, and the General
earned a measure of hard-earned trust.  

It is after this that both Maelstefas and his love disappear from the
stories of history.  His ultimate fate is unknown.  It is posited that he
perhaps fell victim to the blades of the assassins of the Shunned for his
betrayal.  Indeed, the memory of the Coven is long and their appetite for
revenge unquenchable.  It is also thought that perhaps the pair charged into
the depths of Xiginath in a doomed quest to strike at the heart of evil. 
However, this author likes to imagine that they both retired from the life
of adventure in quiet, peaceful anonymity and went on to live out their
remaining days in happiness and peace.

{WChapter 1 - Aramril\@s Purpose{n
                       -----------------------------
Hello, adventurer.  You\@ve been honored with the opportunity to serve the 
light as a Champion of the Light.  As a Champion, you will be based in the 
Tower of Aramril.  In the tower you\@ll find fellowship with brothers and 
sisters of the same mindset.  The tower stands as a bastion against the 
darkness that threatens the world.
  
Your purpose in the tower is to carry out Aramril\@s tenets.  You\@re to see
that justice is served, mercy is granted, and courage never falters.  As 
you are a Champion, so are you marked out;  there will be those that hunt 
you simply because you are who you are.  Still, so long as you honor your 
oath, and enforce the tenets, Aramril will always offer you refuge.
  
The order of Aramril is a militant one; as all military orders, it has 
its structure and regulations.  I have compiled this manual in an attempt
to convey this information to you.  Read it and understand its content, 
for along with the the three tenets and the three commandments, this 
information forms the basis for the Champions of the Light.
~
E
codex3~
{WCHAPTER 2 - Structure of the Champions{n
                --------------------------------------
The Champions are divided into several ranks.  These ranks are instituted 
in order that a chain of command be established.  The chain of command 
will be detailed in the next chapter.  Each position has its own 
responsibilities.  In this chapter, I will attempt to detail them.  It 
should be noted that guild standing has little to do with what position 
one attains.  Rank is attained only through merit.  
    
The highest mortal power in Aramril is that of the Lord General. The 
Lord General is chosen by a deity of the light; generally this would be 
Jolinn.  The General\@s word is law.
    
 When it comes to the conflicts that arise in the tower, the General is 
the final arbiter.  He or she oversees the overall direction in which the 
house will go.  The General is responsible for inducting new members, as well
 as giving them positions within the order.  The General is also responsible 
for maintaining relations with other houses.
  
The Chancellor is the General\@s most trusted advisor.  He or she is 
generally well respected and quite a tactician.  It\@s his or her job to aid 
the General in making the various decisions that affect the internal state 
of the tower.  Disputes amongst ranking officers are to be forwarded to the 
Chancellor, as well as the General.  It should be noted that the 
Chancellor is the highest power appointed by a mortal, in the tower.
~
E
codex4~
The title of Paladin is bestowed upon those directly under the command of 
the Chancellor.  They act as tacticians, formulating plans of battle, and 
seeing that they are acted out properly.  Paladins are generally very 
knowledgable adventurers.  A Paladin must be a good leader, as he or she 
will be called on to lead soldiers into battle.
  
A Knight is a Champion who has proven his or her mettle.  He or she has 
either been a novice for a long time, or has distinguished himself in some 
way.  The Knight is considered the most common type of soldier in the 
order they make up the backbone of Aramril\@s army.  Knights are capable 
leaders; in the event that a Paladin is not present to act thusly, they 
will do so.  As a Knight, one is expected to demonstrate the tenets of Aramril 
superbly.
  
The lowest rank in the tower is that of Novice.  The Novice is generally a 
new Champion.  Novices are directly under the command of the more 
experienced Knights; he or she has generally demonstrated his knowledge of 
the tenets, but has not borne the burden of time, or distinguished his or 
her self in some way.  Novices hearken: though you are the least 
experienced of the order, you are in no way insignifigant.  As a Champion 
of Avendar, you have found fellowship.

{WCHAPTER 3 - Behavior Suggestions for Each Rank{n
             ----------------------------------------------
  
Behaviour of the Ranks:
  
{YNovice{n: 
  
Novices are expected to spend much of their time in meditation about the 
tenets of Aramril, and in service to their brethren, following the orders 
of their commanding Knight and other authorities within the Tower, within
reason.  To be a novice is to reflect upon what it is to be a Champion of 
the Light, and what the future holds.
  
{YKnight{n:
  
To be a Knight of the Champions is to know what one should be doing and 
how one will best serve in the current situation.  Instead of meditation, 
a Knight should always be out of the Tower, and in amongst the general
populace, doing the good works of the Champions.  However, the Tower,
as always, serves as a refuge for when the Knight requires rest or 
protection.
  
{YPaladin{n: 
  
A Paladin of the Champions is always working to coordinate and direct the 
works of the Knights and Novices below him.  He may spend more time in the 
tower, working on plans and giving reports to the Chancellor and the High
General, but he will also perform all the duties of a Knight as he is able 
to.  Paladins are those who walk on the path of Righteousness, with little 
or no error.
  
{YChancellor{n: 
The Chancellor, being the highest ranked Champion appointed by a mortal, 
is held to the highest standard.  His assistance is always given to the 
High General, and his works to monitor and deal with matters takes high 
priority.  He aids the High General as his closest and most trusted 
advisor, and is often known for his great wisdom and clarity of vision.
  
{YHigh General{n: 
The Champion of the Champions, the person chosen for this responsibility 
must not walk the path of righteousness, but walk a path so narrow it 
would thread a needle.  He is, naturally, the role model of
the Champions.
~
E
codex6~
{WCHAPTER 4 - Common Military Courtesy{n
                   ------------------------------------
  
Custom and courtesty have both a place and a purpose in the order of Aramril. 
There are a few methods of address and ceremony that you will need to learn. 
You will be expected to adhere to these guidelines, as through them, you will 
convey respect to your fellow Champions.  Read this chapter, and learn well 
its contents.  If you do so, you will find your time in Aramril much more 
efficient.
  
Firstly, we will consider the salute.  The salute is the most basic kind 
of knightly courtesy.  It conveys the respect for the person that you are 
saluting.  A salute is initiated by the lower ranking officer; if the 
officers are of the same rank, either may initiate.  A salute should 
always be returned.  It is very disrespectful for an officer to receive a 
salute, and not give one in return.  To properly administer a salute, an
officer stands rigid. The officer then places the right hand to the left 
forearm, and the left hand to the right forearm.
  
Secondly, there is the matter of address.  You will address a superior 
officer by their rank.  Knight so-and-so, Paladin so-and-so, etc.  
Officers of the same rank are to address each other as Brother so-and-so or 
Sister so-and-so, in front of Champions of the lower ranks.  Privately, 
they may address each other by name.  Higher ranked officers may address 
those of lower rank by name, though the title brother or sister is 
always considered more respectful.  Also, you may answer officers of a 
superior rank with the respectful titles \#Sir\# and \#Ma\@am\#.  
  
As was previously stated, these guidelines are just that:  guidelines.  In 
times of battle, or in situations that might be perilous, some or all of 
these formalities may be dispensed with.  It is expected that a Champion 
of Aramril will have the good sense to know when this be the case.  Through 
these measures, it is hoped that we might come to love and respect one 
another to an even higher degree.
~
E
codex7~
{WChapter 5 - The Chain of Command{n
                     --------------------------------
  
In order to be the efficient force that it is is, the Champions of Aramril 
must maintain a strict chain of command. Without this, there might be 
ambiguity as to what is to be done.  The resulting chaos might lead to 
defeat in battle.  To prevent this from happening, I will attempt to 
completely document how all militant actions should be carried out.  
  
An officer always carries out the commands of a superior officer.  A command 
may be questioned, but not publicly.  This should be done privately with the 
officer in question.  Regardless, commands are to be immediately carried 
out.  Officers are expected to consult their lesser ranked comrades, in hopes 
that an efficient plan of battle be formulated.  
  
Problems with a ranking officer should be forwarded to the General and 
the Chancellor.  This includes problems with commands that have been 
given. They may attempt to disregard the dispute, speak with the 
officer informally, or call a council of Champions.  The council of 
Champions is the most dire consequence of the three.  The decision to 
call council is the at the sole discretion of the General.  
  
A council of Champions is a formal affair; it is only used in the most 
dire of situations.  It is open to all Champions; all who are able to 
attend will be required to do so.  Firstly, the accused will testify
on his own behalf.  After that, he will be allowed to call witnesses
in his defense.  If the accusor is present, he will then be allowed to 
speak; if not, then the Lord General will present the case against the 
accused.
~
E
codex8~
After both sides are heard, a formal vote will be taken as to the guilt or 
innocence of the accused party.  The Lord General does not receive a vote, 
but he or she may overrule any decision.  If the procedure is not 
completed as explained, the Council is considered a mistrial, and no 
action will be taken against the accused Champion.
  
By following the chain of command stringently, a semblance of order will 
be achieved.  Battles will be fought more smoothly; ambiguity amongst the 
ranks will be minimized.  It is expected that every Champion adhere to the 
rules regarding the chain of command.  To circumvent the chain of command 
is immediate grounds for disciplinary action.
~
E
codex9~
{WCHAPTER 6 - Final{n
                          -----------------
    
In coming to the tower, you have made a great step.  I am confident that 
each of you will find your place in the tower, and that you will use it to 
enforce our tenets.  Through the regimentalization of Aramril\@s forces, 
we will better be able to purify the world of dark influence.  It is the 
belief of this author that if you memorize this manual, adhere to its edicts, 
and do your best to enforce the tenets of Aramril, you will succeed as a 
Champion.  I bid you all well, and hope that you find happiness as a soldier 
of the light.

Most chaja will fall into one of three categories:
  
The {yslave chaja{n, a servant of the shuddeni race. These chaja are servile
and submissive, and generally obey all commands given by a shuddeni. They
are likely to rely on their masters for most of their needs. Some slave
chaja have one specific master, while others are not owned by a specific
shuddeni, but serve any of that race.
  
It is assumed that all chaja born into slavery are conditioned, tortured,
and enchanted, until their broken minds are fit for a life of servitude.
  
The {yfreed chaja{n, a chaja who has broken the bonds of the shuddeni
race. Some are freed by the intervention of kindly psionicists or other
magical interference, while others overcome their mental shackles by sheer
strength of will. In any case, these chaja are likely to harbor a rabid
hatred of shuddeni, and many spend the rest of their lives striking back at
 their former masters, or trying to free their enslaved brethren.
  
The {yferal chaja{n, a chaja who was born outside of captivity, and raised
without bondage of any kind. While these chaja have not had their minds
shattered by shuddeni conditioning, neither have they benefitted from the
training chaja slaves receive. They are usually just as mentally inept as
the other chaja
~
E
book1~
{WTHE CHAJA{n
                         by Bii\@ghoi ei\@Rolok
  
  
  
Chaja are a predominantly subterranean race, strong and healthy despite
generation upon generation of enslavement and abuse by the shuddeni.  
While some are raised feral, out of captivity, the bulk of the chaja are 
born into bondage.  They are found almost exclusively in the underground
city of Yithoul.  Traditionally meek and servile, a very few have been 
known to break free, sometimes exacting horrific revenge upon their masters.
The females of the race are particularly notorious for their violence when
young of the race are threatened.
  
Chaja are between seven and eight feet in height, their large bulk nearly as
muscular as the alatharya.  Possessing dusky, black-grey skin and milky white
eyes, chaja are quite tough and resilient beings.  They are relatively hairy,
many wearing their hair loose.
  
As chaja are rather simple beings and have been oppressed and discouraged from
all forms of learning for centuries, their latent abilities lend themselves to
a very few trades.

Captured.  No escape.  Perhaps I can bite off my tongue and die before it
begins. 
  
\#Many are the hungry hands that shall riven your insignificant frame this
eve, foolish boy-child,\# the Lord of Tombs grated in a bastard offspring of
whisper and conceited proclamation.  His hood-shrouded countenance held a
wary inch beyond the reach of Shujakra\@s arms should the light-fingered
youth find them suddenly emancipated from their barbed bindings by the
clandestine slice of a hidden razor or lockpick, the Elder of the Xthjala
Sept downturned the corners of his mouth portentously, completing an eyeless
glare of unadulterated loathing.  Abhorrence ravaged his ancient features
like a pox, every wrinkle of bleached, leathery skin a fissure harboring
infinite malice at its doleful depths.  
  
\#They are famished, you see,\# goaded the High Priest, his foul, cold
breath assailing Shujakra\@s nostrils, causing revulsion to join terror\@s
ranks for its final siege upon the child-thief\@s sanity.  \#The Tzk\@ak\@shaal
Frame-renders sustain them with little more than the rotted blood of
beasts-- and you, idiot housebreaker,-- you will be perhaps the most welcome
meal of their wretched lives.\#  
  
Vraksekka Xthjala-Tzk, The Lord of Tombs, straightened his robe-swathed
figure, drawing himself back a pace from his prisoner.  It was becoming
steadily obvious to him that this interrogation was worth neither his time
nor his breath; the youth was most likely a statureless lackey for one of
the Tzakm-nztheth.  \#Skilled enough,\# the Lord of Tombs perceived, \#that the
leader of his Tzakm might assign him the task with relative confidence in
his success, but expendable to the point that it is of little consequence to
the same that he presently lives out his final hour.\#
~
E
codex3~
It was hardly likely that this spineless cutpurse, who quivered now
before him and his motionless, crimson-cloaked Tzk\@ak\@shaal Personal Guard,
was told who or what had hired his Tzakm to perform the most foolhardy deed
which now consequentially doomed him to his untimely demise.  Vraksekka
could sense the delinquent\@s fear, could sight it as if it were a physical
augmentation of his stripped and battered frame.  \#Pilfering rations from
the store-house, a smith\@s new-forged dirk perhaps the intermittent
apothecary\@s vial, no?\#.
  
 Still, Vraksekka could not resist the urge to personally see to the
inquisition and punishment of the unlikely one who unwittingly came so very
close to catalyzing a civil war of incomparable severity within the
rock-hewn protectorate of the Xthjala Sept, and to stripping its Elder of
his most prized and curious of arcane artifacts.  \#You honestly have no idea
what sure and fatal world you have, by way of most unhappily idiotic
banditry, crossed over into, Shujakra Xthjala-Ny.\#  It was the first time
the Elder actually spoke his name; his mouth hurled the words like three
rusted spears, their barbed and envenomed lengths beaten into form by the
unceasing hammer of Acrimony Itself.  His guard tensed and fell into step as
he took a sudden stride towards the blood-stained far wall of the chamber,
against which Shujakra\@s incarcerated frame buckled and bled.
~
E
codex4~
\#Ah, but you attempt to flee your mind from this place,\# The Lord of
Tombs chided, noting that Shujakra\@s sightless head had turned to face the
chamber\@s frigid floor in active attempt to block away the reason-shattering
reality of his imprisonment and imminent uncreation, \#You understand that I
will not allow this, and still you make attempt\# The rune-fringed edges of
his midnight robes rustled around the High Priest\@s bony ankles as he moved
to stand directly before Shujakra\@s slumping, nude body.  \#You...  Hope!\# 
The Elder of Dread sardonically scathed, taking Shujakra\@s fallen head by
the chin in an icy pincer of thumb and forefinger.  He already knew it had
been the gold reserves of the Urith\@nazan Enclave that had financed this
attempted theft; although there were many underground Orders with personal
vendettas against him, and even more with long-festering plots to usurp his
rule, only the Scrollkeeps of the Urith\@nazan understood the intricacies of
the Shrouded and the Limitless with depth enough to comprehend the Ikon\@s
true power.
  
No, there was little more to this now than sport: fate had encroached but
it had not struck him.  Now he would celebrate.  \#Hope\# he echoed in a
coarse whisper which stemmed from some staggeringly foul place beneath the
midnight folds of his richly-woven attire, lifting the boy\@s face to meet
his own, his time-twisted, shadow-caressed features saturating the terrified
shuddeni\@s senses.  With a sudden burst of force and motion that defied his
ancient, withered appearance, Vraksekka Xthjala-Tzk\@s opposite hand shot
forward, its skeletal digits balled into a tight fist, striking Shujakra
brutally in the stomach.  The blow landed as sure as a barbarian\@s
warhammer.  Shujakra\@s lightly-built abdominal muscles convulsed revoltingly
as flailing tendrils of ominous darkness skittered about the site of impact,
a sadistic grin taking the Elder\@s features as he grunted an acerbic Word of
Power.
~
E
codex5~
All too suddenly Shujakra could once more hear the screaming from the
adjacent slave cells all around him, a maelstrom of pleading tenor and
woeful baritone never-ending: the collective unconsciousness of the Saddened
singing to him of his own impending finish, louder still with each twist of
thumb and laceration of unwashed flesh.  A drowning sensation took him as
his most recent breath of foul air clawed its way out of his blow-rapped
lungs.  Numb with pain and too stunned to fully perceive the present,
Shujakra retreated into the churning recollections of his past with a raw
ferocity that transcended language and sentience.  Flash after flash of
primal sensation shook his mind, electric pockets of memory exploding
through his consciousness as if his brain had been stuffed to the ears with
the extract of Ythjul Fungus he and his friends used to very carefully soak
in warm water, roll into balls, and throw at a money-changer or a group of
females from the Xrenil Conclave for sport, long before they either became
professionals or died in the streets.  
  
Shujakra had become a professional. 
  
The guildmasters of Tzakm Sthkvu had always jested aloud at how his mind had
been meant for the Conclave and Its Ponderings, but alas; those caught at
birth by the dust rarely rise from it, and an archmage of the Xthjala Sept\@s
most prestigious academy of spellcraft would never have accepted one of such
titular and financial lackings to study under her rod.  It was by chance
alone that Shujakra had even come to be held as a brother of the Sthkvu, a
Greater Tzakm controlled and restrained by its Afshlh and his council well
enough to both survive as a brotherhood and turn an impressive profit.  
The memory of the night Shujakra feinted and thrusted, locked in a
feverish razordance with a brother of the Sthkvu, shot through his
semi-conscious mind: The whole of his being ravaged with the desire to
experience more, faster, in greater complexity and completeness.  His
partaking of a hair-thin sliver of Ketsari Fungus a friend of his had stolen
from the Xrenil Conclave but had himself been too scared to swallow.
~
E
codex6~
Threads of control, of consciousness becoming visible for the first time,
quickly unraveling, disintigrating into nothingness.  His waking dream of a
spark in the blackness, growing, enlarging, until the realization came that
it was he who was rushing, falling, plummeting towards It.  Panic.  The
silent screaming as the ever-increasing mass of flame grew still, the
outlines of city walls patrolled by beings of horror absolute, the whole of
the swirling mass resolving into the distinct and individual forms of a
thousand, thousand demonic denizens.  Horror upon horror upon horror.  The
sudden realization that somewhere, far away, he possessed a body still, and
that it ran the streets of Xthjala absent of his detached sentience.  That
it held a dagger in its right hand, balanced and keen.  And that it--the
husk of his physical remains--called to him, pulling him up like a sudden
stirring of wings, reversing his descent into dream-drunk Vision, beckoning
with a whisper a supplication a stern entreaty a mandate.  Every muscle in
his body tensing as the world snapped back into focus, his hands shooting
away from his frame in a wild attempt to release out the vehemence of the
dream that still rifled through his soul like ball lightning.  The world
returning to him.  A blade suddenly arcing forward to parry the vicious
thrust of his own.  And then--
~
E
codex7~
His blackened, naked feet barely touching the rounded stones of the
arching bridge over the subterranean Xthjalan River, propelling him forward,
loud with the thundering echo of his oxygen-parched lungs expanding and
collapsing.  The whole of his form shifting suddenly to push aside the
curving slice of black iron, hot in the grasp of his opponent.  His lifebeat
laughing with the purity of it all: every note of the underground river\@s
rapid cadenza pure rapture in his ears, a battle song rushing from below the
bridge\@s stones, its key and meter shifting with his every subtle change in
stance.  He sensed and acknowledged every bead of sweat that formed on both
him and his adversary, and with each darting pass he felt ever more greatly
infused with the purity of the truth that perhaps only the child, the
madman, the ascending demigod, and the dying combatant share.  His blade
shooting forward like a wall of spears as his opponent did the same, both
weapons loosing themselves from their masters\@ grips.  A sudden moment of
unlikely tranquility as his opponent\@s eyeless gaze found his own.  The
bridge\@s cobblestone rushing up to meet him as a fistful of soft powder was
flung into his face, his muscles relaxing beneath him as the very first
grain touched the inside of his left nostril.  The slow, winding return to
the blackness that he could not possess, the expanse that he could not yet
begin to comprehend, the microscopic spark of flame dancing on creation\@s
horizon, its malevolence but suggestion, and yet threatening still to pull
him towards it once more.  A sudden, harsh odor seizing his senses: \#Wake,
child you live still you you fought like a demon\# The first words he
recalled when he returned to consciousness at the depths of the Halls of
Tzakm Sthkvu.  Among his new brothers.  Within his new home.

The dream was always the same.  It was as if the Ketsari had embossed a
frieze of raw experience upon the contours of his mind the night his spirit
fell from the mortal world, tumbling devoid of control towards the Soft
Places.  But that too had been nothing more than a dream, had it not?  The
mind-change associated with certain herbs was nothing new to this
once-denizen of the impoverished Xthjalan streets.  In his early youth, he
had known many of his ilk who had abandoned the reality of their lives for
the sanctuary of the Quellena root, or the loving embrace of the Asmrata
petal.  But, as was known to both scholar and street scum, Ketsari was
different.  One could not hope to vend a vile of dream fungus in the
streets, even if one somehow acquired a sliver of the rare herb against
conceivable odds.  A small patch was rumored to grow in the palace gardens
of the Xthjala-Tzk, and there was always, of course, the Xrenil Conclave
from which his daring friend had lifted the bit he had so foolishly
consumed.  But the foolish street merchant would find no buyers in the
subterranean black marketplaces that choked the troubled citys alleyways:
unlicensed possession was met by a punishment far worse than death, and then
there were, of course, the stories.

There were those who fell asleep and never woke up.  Others still who,
quite unconscious, walked from room to room of some three-copper inn
slaughtering the tenants while they slept, only to have no recollection of
the deed when accosted and roused to wakefulness.  The Conclave oft spoke
publicly unto the people, and the cryptic nature of their words frightened
the general public into subservience.  Their sages admonished that the
untrained mind fell thrall not to the herb itself, but to those beings who
might be called into contact by it.  It gifted unto the weak-willed not
insight, but a plague of madness which threatened to destroy the users very
soul.
~
E
codex4~
And within the halls of Sthkvu, the madness would come to challenge
Shujakra for ownership of {Whis{n soul.  The fires of Logor illuminated the
fringes of his nightly dreamscapes as he slumbered beside the other brothers
in the Tzakms barracks.  Oftentimes he would startle to alertness those
sleeping in the bunks above or below him with repeated episodes of
unconscious screaming in alien tongues.  He would be woken up to a reality
of fever and sweat.  Other Sthkvu initiates began to gesture at him and
whisper amongst themselves on the training grounds.  It was not long before
the Tzakm Elders took notice of his affliction.  A richly-bribed rogue
member of the Xrenil Conclave administered a complete set of tests gauging
his natural magical affinity; his results scored in excess of some Xrenil
initiates.  As he progressed in his studies of the Sthkvu School of shadow
combat, it became apparent to the Tzakm Elders that Shujakra could play a
major part in the covert wars between the Xrenil Conclave and Tzk\@ak\@shaal
government.  For years now, the Conclave had been the Tzakms primary client,
but the targets the two organizations agreed upon were always minor and
indirect.  In the recent months, however, representatives of the Xrenil
Conclave had been arriving in the halls of the Sthkvu with ever-greater sums
of gold and platinum, requesting everything from the shadowing of Tzkakshaal
officials to the assassination of the Lord of Tombs himself.  The Tzakm
Elders had been forced to admit that the tasks requested of their men were
beyond their scope of ability until now.

Shujakra continued to receive special training in combat and spellcraft
from his trainers.  His life on the streets seemed like a distant memory. 
He accomplished his objectives swiftly, mechanically, retreating to the
library when the night\@s work was complete.  He rarely slept more than an
hour a night, and always with a gag inside his mouth.  When the Elders
called upon him with orders to infiltrate the personal palace of the Lord of
Xthjala, Vraksekka Xthjala-Tzk, and steal his prized artifact, the
Demonspine Ikon of Chaigidon, they mentioned that his success would result
in him rising immediately to the rank of Tzakm Lord.  They did not mention
what the result of failure might be.  
~
E
codex6~
Now, naked and at the end of the physical and mental limits of his
endurance, Shujakra Xthjala-Ny managed to raise his gaze from the floor of
his prison and stare directly at his smug-faced captor.  Enough of this! 
Rasped the hooded Lord of Tombs, signaling to his Tzk\@ak\@shaal Personal
Guard to escort him from the torture chamber with a wave of his skeletal
left hand while summoning a Frame-Render to the cell with a rap of his staff
against the cold stone floor.  Finish him.  Spare this one no agony and feed
the corpse to the Saddened, the Lord instructed without breaking stride from
the chamber.  Then to his high guardsman, Have an Acolyte return the Ikon to
my chambers.  See to it that it is done under a high guardsmans watch.  The
Lord of Tombs paused and looked almost lovingly at the sack of woven iron
that still held the Ikon before taking his leave of the chamber.

*a crude sketch of the woven iron-mail bag follows*
~
E
codex7~
Shujakra glanced at his executioner and heaved.  He had heard tales of
the Tzkakshaal Frame Renders, but had always dismissed them as the stuff of
morbid fabrication.  Now he saw that there was more revolting truth to these
tavern tales than fiction.  For one, they had been correct about the face. 
The being that stood before him appeared to be only vaguely shuddeni.  Its
back hunched forward at an impossible angle, he could see that iron screws
bound strips of metal plate to its flesh, functioning as a sort of ghastly
armor.  And the face!  He could not envision a trauma sufficiently brutal
enough to reduce the creatures countenance to the mangled maelstrom of
fractured bone and scarred flesh which became it.  Its eye sockets were
marked with fresh puncture wounds, blood flowing from them like ghastly,
symmetrical rivers.  Its nose had long since surrendered to an unceasing
barrage of blows and had caved in.  Its cheeks, lips, neck all looked as if
they had been turned inside out, and the whole of its face was slick with
blood.  The rumors were true, then: the Frame Renders gained their unmatched
knowledge of agony from experience.  At the expense of their own bodies--and
perhaps their minds as well--they cultivated a deep, profound, and complete
love of suffering.
~
E
codex8~
The nightmare before him bowed ever so slightly before drawing a dull, curved
iron razor from its jangling belt of horrors.  Without a word, it dragged
the blade leisurely across Shujakras face, from forehead to chin, leaving a
crimson crescent.  Shujakra bit his lower lip to avoid crying out, the
incision suddenly forcing him to remember his last line of self-defense. 
Being careful to conceal the movement of his hands, he began to scrape the
barbs of his wrist manacles against a section of skin upon his nude back. 
The leather pouch of contact poison had been sewn beneath his skin when he
had graduated from Tzakm Sthkvus initiation process.  The pouch was thin
enough to be properly concealed beneath the skin, soft enough to be nearly
undetectable to the touch.  He dragged the barbs of his manacles against the
scarred-over stitches in his lower back, timing his movements to the lashes
of his torturers razor.  The Frame Render appeared to be so gleefully
obsessed by his work that he did not notice the fresh pool of blood
gradually forming behind his victim.  With great pain and effort, Shujakra
freed the blood-drenched pouch from his flesh and slit it quickly with a
pass of the manacles.
~
E
codex9~
As the Frame Render arced back his wrist to swing his dagger again,
Shujakra pivoted from his hips, swinging his bound wrists towards the
abomination and letting the refined contact poison fly from his hands.  With
so many exposed wounds, the torturer was dead before he hit the ground, his
gruesome plate armor clattering loudly against the cells floor as the earth
took him.  Shujakra sprinted for the corpse; careful to avoid the poisoned
flesh, he withdrew a wicked-looking hand axe from the fallen torturers belt,
and freed his wrists in one blind, clumsy swing of its blade.  Grimacing
under the pain of his wounds, he limped towards the chambers exit.  The
sight of his iron sack laying unguarded on an operation table before the
exit, his stolen prize still secured within, brought the first feelings of
joy to his heart he could remember since the botched run began.  He picked
it up and slung it over his shoulder.  He held his prize and he was armed,
but he had overheard the Lords orders: an acolyte of Akshaal and a Xthjalan
High Guardsman were likely already descending towards the chamber, and in
moments they would be upon him.  Bracing himself, he drew a sharp breath and
exited the cell, beginning his ascent up a windowless, spiraling stairway of
stone.

scratched into the brittle, shiny wax with painstaking care in harsh

Shujakra rounded the final flight of spiral stairs to find the tip of a
sword thrust an inch from his neck.  Drop the blade, the cool, calm voice of
a Xthjalan High Guardsman instructed, and relinquish the Demonspine. 
Shujakras heart sank as he let the axe slip from his grasp, standing
perfectly motionless as it clattered down two flights of stairs before
coming to rest.  Before the handaxes chorus of echoes finished singing,
Shujakra flung himself backwards, rolling wildly down the stairs as the Ikon
whipped forward over his shoulder and into his arms.  Hugging the sack of
iron weave firmly to his chest, the warrior-assassin of Tzakm Sthkvu
attempted to control his descent as best he could, but already he could hear
bones fracturing and breaking as his body impacted against the stone stairs
again and again.  Dazed and only barely conscious, he fell in a heap at the
bottom of the stairwell, the sound of the High Guardsmans pursuit booming
down the stairs after him.

{WNow{n, a voice whispered, a tiny raft of sentience
afloat upon a sea of pain and nausea.  {WI am your only hope now.  Draw me
out.  You will not die here.  Call on me.  Now, now, now...{n  Shujakra sat
up, coughing up blood.  His hands, half the digits of each broken,
unfastened the latch on the steel pouch and drew the Ikon out, impaling the
palm of his left hand on one of Its many razor-sharp spires.  His head
snapped back as the voice in his mind suddenly grew from a whisper to a
thundering roar, {WYes!  Give me your blood and your prayers, mortal!  You
hear me now!  You hear the voice of the Demon Lzakjiil!  Pray!  Pray with
all your soul and I will release you from this sure and imminent death!  You
have seen my kind in your dreams!  I taste the Ketsari in your blood!  You
who are damned know me!{n  Shujakra felt an electric numbness course through
his hands, his arms, his core.  They were not dreams.  He understood.  Real
as blood and bones.  I pray, then, he coughed.  I know you.

{WTHEN EMBRACE ME AS YOUR LORD{n, the spine of the demon ordered.  The command
seized his every muscle, and he thrust the demon spine to his chest.  The spires 
of ancient bone pieced his flesh, plunging through his heart, flooding his lungs 
with his own tainted, syrupy-black blood.  {WFOOL!  YOUR ESSENCE IS MINE!  BY THE
ANCIENT WAYS, YOUR BLOOD-BEQUEST IS ALL MINE!  WATCH NOW!  I STAY YOUR DEATH
THAT YOU MAY WATCH AS I ACCEPT YOUR OFFERING!{n  Shujakra slumped forward over
the Ikon as it began to pulse with tendrils of dark energy.  {WIA CHAIGIDON

\#Adviser-Chagrob\#, whispered the unmoving lips of prophetess Serthathophet,
\#tell your Lord and Master that our mortal visitor has returned.\#  \#Do not
dwell on it, corpse-woman,\# the fallen once-Lord of the Thirteen replied, \#the
mortal\@s soul has come nightly to howl and bang on our gates for
three-and-one Avendarian yearspan.  He is no sorcerer, and the Taskmasters
think him no spy.  His fury is wonderfully amusing, though, is it not?  And
to think that these woeful wanderings of his happen during his minds period
of supposed rest!  But the Ketsari\@s irony has always matched its savory
flavor in deliciousness.  Why, once I ordered gathered every mind-poison
possessed in the collected knowledge of Avendarian herbology to be pressed
into a liquor and force-fed to a certain haughty archmagus why, not far in
hubris from yourself, Serthathophet, when you were young and beautiful and

with arrogance unfounded, yess?\#

Hundreds of purple tentacles, which had grown in the place of her
hewn-off arms, thrashed violently in the direction of the demons mocking
words.  Rarely did Chagrob pass up a chance to taunt the damned shade of
this long-dead artisan of the magicks of the void.  She had made one single,
grave, and foolish mistake, and now every second of her eternal damnation
metered away her unending punishment.  Xthjich once told me that you were
his favorite, although you were certainly not the first of his mortal
lovers, nor his las Silence!  Hissed the detached voice of Serthathophet,
her claw-slashed vocal chords providing no aid in the formation of her plea.
As you wish, dead woman, Chagrob chuckled, his glowing, crimson eyes shining
malevolently from within his swirling form of blackest pitch.  Now, why am I
to announce this common occurrence to my busy, busy master?  Serthathophet
closed her rotten eyelids momentarily, wrapping her tentacles around her
floating form in a self-embrace; she shivered.  He, she whispered above a
sudden rush of void-borne wind, he is here in full, h- her rotten, lithe
breast heaved suddenly as a rippling form pushed against the walls of her
accursed womb from within, all of him, my childe tells me.  Or all that is
left of him.  Mind, body, soul.  How can that be?  The demon asked.  He is
no demilich, able to cross the silver veil in full whenever he wills!  He is
barely a practitioner!  No ancient order has claimed him, and the
Ketsari-\#..  
~
E
codex7~
An unwholesome groan cut off the demon\@s rantings.  Serthathophet
shuddered and attempted to cry out, her slashed throat producing little more
than a dry gurgle, as a newborn void wyrm slithered from between her legs,
parting the folds of her ancient, torn dress of silk.  The eyeless wyrm
childe coughed up a sticky ball of putrid, black embryonic fluid and spoke
in an unbroken stream of prophecy in the demon tongue, \@mortal free demon
Lzakjiil-Chaigidon demon taunt iron throne mortal message of new freedom
haalllk!\@  With a look of profound sadness upon her undead visage,
Serthathophet strangled the wyrm with a curling of an outstretched tentacle.
\#Lzakjiil the messenger!\# roared Chagrob.  \#I had him destroyed when the iron
throne was my own to rule!  The foolish herald stood before my throne, said
his touching piece \@Zyal of Chaigidon commands, blah blah blah, formal
declaration of war, blah blah blah\@ and then proceeded to blast excrement all
over the floor of my courtroom.  I specifically ordered the torturers to be
certain that he was a thousand times dead!  Augh!  I will see the Lord
Vaeshir at once.\#  \#Perhaps,\# Serthathophet whispered, still grimacing from the
brutal birth, \#you might have the mortal brought into the city as well. 
Without a surgeon, he will not last.\#  \#What do I care of the mortal?\#  Chagrob
boomed, spinning to fly from the prophetess\@ chambers.  \#He I see.  He knows
us.  He is ours, a tool, yet he does not know it.  His way is of the True
Arts, but only should he live.  I have seen it, I have seen it he heard the
demons spell the channel that opens the gate to Chaigidon.  Although he does
not consciously grasp them, the words are in his memory.  They must not be
lost.  As the Prophetess pronounces,\# Chagrob grumbled sarcastically, so the
Logorian Court heeds.  \#And then, I should never have kept you,
Serthathophet, although I won you fairly.\#  
  
\#I serve in pleasure\#, the corpse spat dolefully.

codex8~
Shujakra heard all, but saw nothing.  The voice rasped instructions in
the shuddeni tongue, every word etching itself into the core of his being. 
{WI could destroy you,{n the voice said.{W  I could let you die.{n  With all his
heart, Shujakra wished to respond.  \@Please!  Why am I not dead?  Please!\@
But he could not.  He could only make use of what limited sense remained,
and listen, and wait.  {WIndeed, the mercy of Askhari would be a gift to you
after what you have experienced.{n  The name seemed very familiar, but..
{WHowever, a childe of Serthathophet has suggested that you might be of some
use to Logor.  I have sensed your coming for some time.  The Ketsari
controls and consumes those minds unable to control it, yes?  But the ship
of void does not sail randomly, Shujakra.  Something within you has sought
me out, and now, with the unlikely help of an enemy of my throne, you have
found me.  Me and mine.  I would allow you to wake here, in Logor, but I
fear the shock of it would kill you.  Hear me, then, Shujakra Xthjala-Ny:
You will return to Avendar.  You will, with the favor of the Iron Throne,
study in the ways of voidcraft.  When your studies are completed, should you
not fail, you will be granted a chance to even the score with the demon who
has so cunningly tricked and gravely wronged you.  In this course of
existence I offer you no choice..\#.{n
  
 Although asleep, Shujakra\@s muscles spasmed as a pair of pentagram sigils
were traced over the depths of his eyeless sockets by some invisible power.
~
E
codex9~
{WThere.  I have drawn from you a portion of your essence and sealed it
within my Throne.  When you wake, you will find yourself quite unable to
practice the ways of shadow combat in your new state.  Should you betray my
kindness, should you repay the mercy of Logor with disloyalty, I shall
annihilate the essence I have drawn from you, as well as uncreate your
physical frame.  Perhaps I shall gift your soul to Chagrob as a plaything;
he is so easily amused by such childish simplicities.  You will awaken now,
Shujakra, first of your people to gaze upon Nimiel and Telianthis.  You will
not forget.{n
  
And then Shujakra sensed himself falling, and hard earth rushing up to greet 
him.

A large, docile, buffalo-like reptile, the srorsian looks like a
large, stout lizard with a humped back and clawless flat feet.
Its head is small in comparison with the rest of its body with
small jaws and crushing plates for teeth. An omnivore, it eats
small rodents and whatever plants it can find. Despite their
sluggishness, srorsians are strong and boast great endurance,
and can even manage bursts of surprising dexterity, if pressed.
Native to the Arid Waste, srorsians can manage to grow to be
very large with age. Often domesticated by desert merchants to

Mildly territorial animals, the cow-like bjorcha have the same
basic ruminant anatomy, with four stocky legs, a greyish, wooly
coat (sometimes tending towards a dun color), thick skulls, and
short, curving horns (on the males).  Native to the lands of the
clan Ryarl, only a few of that pack have been able to successfully
bring these stubborn beasts to tractability and use.

On Accipiter Saras
  
Commonly known as the Raiderbird or the Spinefeathers, these brutal,
lizardlike birds seem part dragon, though this is of course impossible
due to the dissimilarities in anatomy.  With massive, leathery wings,
a deep, heavily muscled pectoral region, and supernatural endurance,
these birds are known to bear Raiders whither they will, according to
a legendary ancient pact with the dark god Ar*****l.  They have short,
yet flexible necks, a heavy, low-browed skull, and a slashing, ravenous
beak.  Their plumage seems more a bony spine with filaments rather than
a true feather, which is why I am reluctant to classify them as birds
rather than lizards.  Additionally, their plumage seems an extension of
their very skeletons rather than follicularly growing from the skin,
which deepens my hesitance.

Volume 1- The Shuddeni, as writ by Haz\@gutru, Priest of Hate
   
Observations and Uses for the Lesser Races
  
Aelin-
Nobility and entitlement runs through their veins as surely
as darkness flows through ours. The aelin ooze this whether
they are in service to goodness or evil, making them thoroughly
insufferable to deal with in either case. They are skilled
diplomats, however, and perhaps we might make use of them in
this regard once they are properly tamed.
  
Alatharya-
The silver-skinned Alatharya have fallen from the grace of the gods
ages ago, and still bear the scars of it upon their minds. This
stupidity makes them useful tools of brutality, but their resistance
to partaking in true evil makes them poor slaves in comparison with
our Chaja.
  
Caladaran-
These peaceful scholars rise such bile in my throat. To think
of the power they might seize with the minds they were gifted with!
Yet, do they make slaves of the lesser races to compensate their
physical frailty? No! They co-exist with them as equals! Fools all;
let us chain them and force their minds toward our ends.
  
Chaja-
Stupid, ugly, simple things, our chaja. How perfectly they illustrate
the proper relationship between our race and others. Subservient.
~
E
volume3~
Ch\@taren-
Foul shimmerskins! They usurped our great ritual! They destroyed our
true destiny to rule this world, and we shall destroy them in turn.
I have devised a thousand thousand tortures to visit upon them and
shall devise a thousand thousand more.
  
Ethron-
Potent warriors and hardy scholars, the ethron have proved
vexing foes in their forested homes. They are sly in the woods and
disappear without a trace. Perhaps we should burn down the forests
that they have nowhere to hide.
  
Humans-
I find humanity infuriatingly inconsistent. They are as likely
to serve us as willing slaves as to crusade against us
in a misguided attempt to end our race. If only there
was a way to divine the heart of a human, but such magic
is beyond our grasp.
~
E
volume4~
Kankoran-
Wonderfully savage, but as hard to guess at as a human.
Their furies strike at all civilizations, be they light
or dark. We just need to guide them to focus on more
preferable targets.
  
Nefortu-
Unpredictable and vicious, the nefortu race is a useful
tool in our battle against the forces of light. Subtle
assassins and cunning warriors, they serve the forces
of the Dragon admirably.. when they can be made to
focus.
  
Srryn-
Monstrous brutes whose savagery is unquestionable. Their
capacity for hate is exceeded only by our own. Unfortunately,
they seem to often focus it on anything that isn\@t srryn, much
like us. A pity that we are far too alike to let each other
survive.

Nefortu-
Nefortu are, by turns, useful and vexing. They are skilled in their
subtle arts of thievery and assassination, making them useful to whom
they work for and vexing to those they work against. They are best
tolerated when working in your best interests, but have the locked up
should they seem to plot against you.
  
Shuddeni-
Dangerous and intelligent, the eyeless shuddeni are exotic and deadly
allies. To sinister to be trusted, but to useful to be ignored. Better
to hire them that your foes do not. They are ultimately orderly in
their machinations, and that means they can be manipulated. Do so.
  
Srryn-
The majority of this beastly race are no better than the kankorans, lurking
in their swamps waiting for any sign of weakeness to strike. This
barbarous strain of the Srryn is not to be tolerated. A number
of these reptiles have made their homes in our cities and attempt
to overcome their circumstances.

Ethron-
Pleasant little lordlings who gladly oversee our forested lands beyond our walls.
They are skilled gardeners as well, I have hired one to tend my flower beds and I\@ve
not scented a more frangrant bouquet of roses and lilies in years. They truely
are a wonder.
  
Humans-
Our burgeoning earth-bound brethren constantly attempt to compete with us,
playing lord in their small burgs and townships. They honestly try, and that
is commendable, but they should not think to replace us, or that they even
can.
  
Kankoran-
Such terrible brutes that rail against the civil order we shepherd so
skillfully. Savages to the man, they have no place in our cities and
offer very little to the society we maintain. Their nomadic nature
makes the undependable at best.

Volume 4- The Aelin, as writ by Alos, Warrior Nobleman
  
Alatharya-
I feel compassion for our silver-skinned forbears. They once occupied
the role we now fill as the leader of the mortal races. Their power was
matched by their wisdom and they ruled justly... for a time. Let us learn
from their errors and not embrace such foolhardy hubris as they did.
  
Caladaran-
The long-lived caladaran offer us wise counsel and their words are to be
heeded, when it is expedient. Their services as scholars are unmatched and
are well worth the sums they ask. One should hire them as your seneshal if
possible, for they are skilled in keeping ones lesser affairs in order.
  
Chaja-
The chaja are brutish, ugly things, but what can be expected of the thralls
of the shuddeni? I have heard titterings that some of them have begun to
seek fortunes on their own. How novel! Perhaps I might hire one as a bodyguard.
How exotic that would be.
  
Ch\@taren-
These well-meaning creatures are often as much a nuisanse as they are a boon.
I know they claim the best intentions but is a civil discussion too much to ask
before they attempt to slay a member of the ruling council? Better they were
outside the city fighting the encroaching barbarians.

Volume 5- The Nefortu, as writ by Karkazt, Merchant and Profiteer
  
Aelin-
The aelin are proud and love to think they are in charge, and can
be humored in that regard to lubricate relations. Just remember
that they only think they are superior. Their candor can
be infectious and their tongues charismatic.
  
Alatharya-
Simple creatures, the alatharya make good laborers. They understand
force and respect, and in our case respect is more expedient. The
alatharya lost none of their strength when they were cast down by
the gods, none at all.
  
Caladaran-
These bark-skinned scholars frustrate me. Too often I have had my
clever schemes unravel before the unyielding logic of these learned
caladaran. Their minds are as potent as ours, even if their natures
do not incline them to put them to devious use.

~
E
volume3~
Chaja-
The slaves of the shuddeni race have begun to cast off their shackles.
Does this mean the fearful sway the shuddeni held over them has begun
to wane, or is it merely another deft feint of those eyeless demons
to put their servants at our throats? Curse it all, I don\@t -know-!
  
Ch\@taren-
I despise the ch\@taren more than the caladaran! Those sanctimonious
bastards won\@t even give my cunning lies ears before bringing their
magics and blades to bear against me! That\@s what hired srryn goons
are for, though, and if you paid them, you might as well use them.
  
Ethron-
The ethron and my people have little in common. They are bound to the
wilds and forests while we home from caves and grottos. Our paths
intersect rarely, and mutual distrust marks these meetings, but there
has been no violence yet. It\@s so encouraging that they might begin
to trust me soon. Then the fun starts, oh yes.
  
Humans-
I\@ve dealt with all manner of humans. Most are tolerable company and
they are all eager to deal. There are so many of them, though, and
it\@s so difficult to tell them apart. For a race without wings, they
have high aspirations though.
~
E
volume4~
Kankoran-
The wolf men are nomadic and this makes them useful for traveling with
my caravans. They are used to travel and hardship. They are strong
too, and make good goons.
  
Shuddeni-
The shuddeni make good planners and scholars. They\@re foul enough to take
any job and if you can\@t bargain a shuddeni down to coppers on murdering
a ch\@taren you\@re a poor haggler indeed. Their almost unsettling
willingness to take on the most sinister tasks lets us keep our hands
clean and their hands busy.
  
Srryn-
They make better goons than kankoran and have the best stories. Srryn
don\@t really care what you think when they tell you they bit out
someones throat, so their stories have the best parts left in. Maybe
a kankoran gets self-conscious about beating someone to death. Never
a srryn.

Nefortu-
Untrustworthy in the extreme, it is wise to always be on your guard about these
tricksters and never trust their word. Many are harmless, but those who embrace
darkness are the most cunning and ruthless of foes.
  
Shuddeni-
They are our enemy. Our antithesis. What more can be said of our race\@s eternal foe?
They are born in darkness as we are in light. Our conflict is without quarter or
mercy.
  
Srryn-
These brutal reptiles ally themselves with the forces of darkness with a handful
of exceptions. Their brute strength and vicious natures make them potent foes. I have
long fought a srryn fire templar, blessed by his foul serpent god, and our battles
have been bloody and fierce. We both bear scars and will gain more before one
of us is well and finally dead.
~
E
volume3~
Chaja-
I pity these foul beings even as I strike them down. An eternity of slavery and
being denied their freedom has made them foul and base. I can only hope they take
comfort in the freedom I grant them at the end of my blade and take peace in the
knowledge their cruel masters will soon follow.
   
Ethron-
The friendly nature of the ethron people is so wonderful. They make fast allies
in the battle against darkness and steadfast friends in times of peace. Their woods
are among the most beautiful of places I have seen in all of Avendar.
  
Humans-
I find humans to be such a curiosity. By far the most prolific race on Avendar,
their nature and skills run the gamut of good and evil, law and chaos. This
versatility makes them impossible to break down into a mere stereotype, so I
won\@t give it much effort.
  
Kankoran-
Wild and free, I admire the unburdened spirit of these northern wolf-men. If they
know it or not they embody the heart of Rystaia\@s teachings on freedom. More is
the pity, therefore, with those who walk the path of evil and who trammel their own
spirits with the burden of guilt. They pervert the gift their race has inherited and 
bring my wrath upon them.
~
E
volume2~
Volume 2- The Ch\@taren, as writ by Meliaos, Crusader of Rystaia
  
Aelin-
The aelin race tears at me. Some of the greatest heroes for good I have
had the honor of meeting are of the race, and yet the darkest magi I\@ve had
to fight share their lineage. I have learned to trust their actions and
scrutinize their words, for their tongues are as silver as my eyes.
  
Alatharya-
The alatharya and I clash on occassion, but it is their simplicity and their
brute ways that cause our fights, no true malice on their part. It pains me
to come to blows with them for our race was struck a blow by the gods as well.
Let the foul Dragon know Vailios is not forgotten.
  
Caladaran-
The caladaran are so very wise and peaceful I could keep company with one for
hours. I must admit their perspective is so much different than mine. Perhaps
their longevity gives them patience I cannot be bothered to harbor in my
travels.  Such self-discipline is to be admired, I suppose.

Volume 3- The Srryn, as writ by Arssaks, Warlord of the Sept
  
There are those of my people who may scoff at my putting pen to my
thoughts. These srryn are fools, for wisdom is another kind of power.
We should know our enemies to better destroy them.
  
Aelin-
These flying, fragile creatures are not to be underestimated. They are
usually the brains behind any assault so it would be wise to destroy
them quickly. They are too proud for slavery and are better killed
than subverted.
  
Alatharya- 
The alatharya are fearsomely strong, but stupid. Very stupid. They
can be enticed into slavery to Sythrak with a good show of force. They
shy from leading a cause, but they will become sheep. Strong sheep.
~
E
volume3~
Caladaran-
I despise these scholars. It is said they are peaceful, but they combat
us with their magics as fiercely as any ch\@taren. They are wise and
know our lore and weaknesses. They should be ground out of the realm.
  
Chaja-
Brutish slaves to the shuddeni, a number of them have broken their bonds
to wander this world. Like us, they are inclined to the service of hate.
Let us be their new masters as we grow in power.
  
Ch\@taren-
They will fight my cause to the ends of Avendar and I will continue to
burn them to cinders. They are a thorn in our side and should be slain
on sight. They are fragile, but ferocious and quick. A few telling blows
should slay one.
  
Ethron-
They aligned against us in the War of Fire, to protect their verdant forests
from our mighty flames. They continue to fight us from their trees and glades.
Even in our swamps they pass like ghosts by our patrollers. If you can catch
one, though, they die like everything else: screaming.
~
E
volume4~
Humans-
A pragmatic approach is needed for these pervasive things. Those who will stand
with us, we shall enslave, and those who don\@t, we shall kill. They fought with us
in the war of fire. It is because they could not control their numbers that Jolinn
was freed from his sleep by humans and his painful magics brought to bear on us.
  
Kankoran-
Too individualistic to tame, these beasts are better bullied and aimed at our
enemies. Or burned. They burn so well. They are warriors, but weak. They can be
killed easily and without reprise.
  
Nefortu-
The slippery nefortu make useful mercenaries, if you make sure to kill them should
they step out of line. They are cowards at heart, and fear is the surest way to rule
them. Be wary of their cunning schemes and betrayals. If you think one of them is
trying to trick you, slay them and put their head on a pike as warning to others of
their kind.
  
Shuddeni-
They too seek to rule this world, but are unfit. Warm blood runs in their veins and
proves them weak. Ally with them when you must, but betray them before they betray
you; and they -will- betray you. They are clever, but weak.

When the time came, the gate opened, and strange golden
beings came out to do battle, having foolishly hijacked
the portal of our destiny to confront us. They were
outnumbered hopelessly, and their pitiful magics were
easily dispelled and their forces overwhelmed. Once
the usurpers were dealt with the gate was truly opened
and the hosts of the void poured forth! A hundred days
of darkness fell over Avendar as our forces, filled with
potent Eshithi and void magics, swept over the land.
City after city fell to our demon army and the great
shuddeni empire spread over the surface of the realm.
The lesser races were impressed into slavery or slaughtered
as needed to appease our Great Lords Beyond. The light
of Avendar was forever extinguished, and darkness reigns
to this day.

Next was the destruction of the Tower of Aramril, as
our organized armies brought forth an aspect of our
Most Just Dragon to judge the worth of the Champions.
They were found unworthy and unfocused and our forces
razed the tower to the ground with no losses, so feeble
was the defence of the Tower of Yellow Stone. It is
said their soldiers broke rank and fled at the first
sign of their loss (which was quickly indeed!). Their
cowardice saw them routed, and the survivors begged
for their lives, pledging their service to the Eternal
Dragon. The Wyrm does not suffer traitors, however,
and their lives were ended at great length. The tower
stands no longer, now. Not even rubble marks its location.
  
We marched upon Earendam next, and laid a long seige.
Despite the overthrow of its just Senate by a corrupt
Patrician, the city defended itself. We took to our
potent arts of manipulating the void to bring about
a grand conjunction; a gate between worlds that would
stand for three days as the hosts of the void poured
forth at our whim!

{WA True and Factual Account of the War of Night{n
     
It is well known that the Shuddeni Hosts rose up from
their exile beneath the earth and brought to bear
their potent and orderly magics on the forces
of chaos above. Ours was a misson of wisdom, for the
lands above were barbaric and untamed with naught but
meaningless bloodshed and petty, pointless rule.
The first offensives were mighty and
our forces waxed powerful as we took Var Bandor with
our void magics. Our teleporting and gating allowed us
to bypass the walls of the delta city and take it as
our own. The bulk of their forces manned their walls
and gatehouses. The fools were routed with our clever
ploy as they were assaulted from without and within!
The leader of the merchant council fell blubbering before
our Warlord Athirsar. Our war-leader took his head as well
as the head of every sixth grown man of Var Bandor to top
the pikes that surrounded the city. The forest of skulls 
has been carefully maintained with our magics.

Nefortu-
These bats are beneath our notice. They are fortunate for their wings
else I would trod them underfoot! They talk and talk and will pay us
to step elsewhere. They give us due respect and this is wise of them.
It is good they know who is better.
  
Shuddeni-
The shuddeni are best crushed to goo, for they often betray our kind
to take as slaves like the pathetic chaja. They are canny but ultimately
we will destroy them in battle. Listen not to their words for their
words are wily and false. They will confuse you and they will use
that to strike.
  
Srryn-
Strong and fierce, but not so strong and fierce as us! In battle we
are far stronger, and with axes of ice they thresh like wheat before

Ch\@taren-
The ch\@taren are kind to us and that is good. Those who are kind
because of pity, I don\@t like. Those who respect me, I do. It is
simple. I have fought them too, depending on whom I work for. For
such flimsy looking people, the shimmerskins are difficult to injure
with normal weapons.
  
Ethron-
I respect their strength and wisdom. In the forests it is good to
listen to their words, for they are wise there. They are not so
strong as we are, though, and should we come to blows, we will win.
It is better not to fight them in the woods, though. They are strong
there.
  
Humans-
There are so many of the little humans. Many seem to be scared of us
for our size and might, or seem to feel they are better than us
because they see us as dumb. It is not comfortable to be with humans.
Crush those who would look down on us. They will fear or respect me,
that is my due.
  
Kankoran-
The wolf-men are strong and swift and make good foes. They fight with
a savagery to match mine. It is good to lose yourself in savagery and
the fury of battle. Its rhythm pounds in my veins as it does through
the kankoran and in this way we are kin.

He brought his fellow Packbrother Locen into the Canyon, and with the
help of a few others he watched the haughty Guardians crumble.  With
the Champion presence on the decline, Thanys cast the remains of Law
to the wind, and looked down upon a world where few civilized men
would form against him.
  
Age had not yet gripped Thanys when he decided his conquests were
sufficient.  He was removed from the rigors of mortality by his
beloved Girikha, and went to serve her more closely.  Though his
empire is gone and the worms have long ago devoured the bones
of his enemy, some claim to have seen the warrior standing mightily
above the storm of his mistress.
  
-Quarentis
~
E
book5~
Thanys remained steadfast, and refused to embrace death at the hands
of either cause.  Frequently outnumbered, he blazed an illusive trail.
It was at this time that there was an unusual struggle, and after a
heroic effort Thanys was among the few to first glimpse the goddess
Girikha as she became known to the land.  He was first indeed to call
himself a Warrior of the Pack.
  
With the blessing of Girikha and the Canyon behind him, he continued
to harry his nemeses.  Aehaeser was his toughest and most confounding
adversary, and the Guardian horde kept him grinding his teeth in
frustration.  His tenacity was not fruitless.  He still terrorized
the cities when all was seemed safe and quiet, and he was appointed
to the seat of the Raider High Lord.
~
E
book4~
While the Kankoran packs were never focused enough to cooperate and invade
the south lands, Thanys\@s own personal campaign was not so unsuccessful.
What started as a young wolf holding a sword of copper would become a
master among warriors, commanding fear as easily as a spear.
  
Thanys headed south with his companion Rskail, and they clumsily immersed
themselves in the ways of the cityfolk.  Even as they hungrily sought
mastery in their respective guilds, Thanys and Rskail began to make their
names known to the world.  By the time they attained that mastery, a
sort of calm had settled as they had thrown down the majority of those
who would oppose them.  Something had happened in the north, though, and
their reports and mission became meaningless to their pack.  The two
friends turned their attentions away from the hunt, as the prey was
scarce, and they further explored the land as rogues.  Thanys found his
way into the Raiders of Twilight, who were only a memory to the rest
of Avendar at the time.
  
When next he turned his attention back to civilization, he found the
Guardians of Law and the Champions weaving their wills on the land.
The unsuspecting fell beneath his spear, and he boldly waged war upon
the Law.  As before, many were slain and his name was whispered once
again.  The Guardians were numerous though, and the cornerstones of
the Champion house were among the most powerful that even the ancient
living could remember.
~
E
book3~
Only the most promising scouts were chosen to undertake this mission.
Thanys knew he would stand among them, and stood proudly as he was 
indeed selected to go before.  Along side his most trusted companion
he started his quest.  Serve the clans well, for the honor of his pack,
for his race, and above all to establish his own legend.

Amidst the continuous freezes, pitched battles, and the rugged life
of the northern kankoran, an unthinkable thing happened.  A culture
unchanged for generations heard rumors that might alter their ways
forever.  A great warrior had arisen from the masses and declared his
intent to unite their race.
  
The day came when a great host challenged the grey pack, and even
the strongest and bravest spirits know their limits.  They accepted 
the Overlord\@s wishes zealously, for his was a plan of a great 
campaign into the south.  Quick, and coming into his own strength,
Thanys awaited this invasion eagerly.
  
He awoke one morning to learn the Overlord himself was coming for an
audience within the grey pack.  Thanys stood among his peers as the
large wolf voiced his purpose.  They must be well prepared for this
war.  It was not enough to march south and destroy; they must know more
of the south if the conquest was to succeed.

The uncharted north is a harsh breeding ground.  Constant warring
and sparse food sources insure that only the strong survive.
Sometimes.  Out of one such pack, Thanys emerged.
  
A tribe predominately short of stature, his grey furred relatives
were still a proud and fierce family.  While some packs defensively
guarded their territories, Thanys\@s own pack led conquests more
often than not.

Rather than being opponents of Order and soldiers of chaos as the Favored of
Girikha are, followers of Tzajai are known for their indifference to the
Laws of Iandir.  Dismissing such things as boring and unworthy of time, they
are far more apt to spend their efforts seeking out thrills and chance. 
Equally notable is their relative apathy towards petty ideals of good or
evil.  While followers may have ties and undeniable links to one or the
other, the wars and concerns of morality hold little interest for the truly
chancy.  
  
Those who would seek out Tzajai\@s attention and favor are often avoided by
normal society.  Rumors speak of an altar in the slum-like underworld of
Earendam where monetary offerings may be made.  However, potential followers
would do well to bear in mind the demigod\@s fixation on mischief; prayers and 
such are just as likely to be answered with folly than with fortune.
~
E
book2~
Worshipped by many sailors, gamblers, and the more suicidal fighters of the
lands, Tzajai has been known to occasionally accept mortal followers. 
Devoted of the demigod are known to live with a fierce predilection for risk
and often danger.  All types of adventurers of chaotic nature have followed Tzajai,
though due to its bent for mischief it is rather favored more by those of
neutral or evil nature.  The symbol most associated with the demigod of Fate
is the wheel, an emblem of cyclic chance and the unpredictability so
inherent to the being of chaos.  
  
*A large picture of a golden wheel occupies the next two pages, illuminated
with gold leaf.  A background of dancing, triumphant figures is painted on
the paper in a wash of pale grey watercolors.*
~
E
book1~
A demigod of Avendar, Tzajai is a deity largely surrounded by questions. 
Widely regarded as a being of pure chaos and mischief, the demigod was first
seen in Avendar when its true essence fixed upon a mortal shell with which
to interface more closely with this plane.  Scholars and sages surmise that
before this bonding, the god (or goddess?) of chance was little more than a
burst of raw planar power from one or several of the chaotic spheres somehow
paired with a degree of constancy and sapience.  
  
Though often seen with its original choice of avatars, a small nefortu
female, the deity of chance has been known it its whimsical meddlings to
assume many forms, few if any of which can be said to have any predictable
pattern.  
  
Tzajai is noted as a being obsessed with its own source of power - chaos and
randomness.  Its only predictability unpredictability, the demigod delights
in discord, chaos, and confusion.  Some historians suggest that the demigod
was drawn to this plane through the superstitions and semi-worship of the
ideal of \@Fortune\@ or \@Destiny\@.  Others simply theorize that to a timeless
being such as Tzajai, Avendar is merely a plaything to be toyed with for an
instant and then cast aside.  Past events give credence to both sides, but
little is certain.

Firstly: Attach bells of various sizes and volume to your cloak, tunic and
breeches.  Not only will you not be able to move about unnoticed and
undetected (especially the ethron idiots seeking prey in the woods) but
you\@ll also tickle your enemies so with the foolishness of your person. 
When this happens and they are rolling upon the cobblestones laughing and
clutching at their ribs, run them through with your sword - that is, if it is
not of the padded sort.  
  
Secondly: Insult younger adventurers, poorly clothed adventurers and even
heroes and heroines the gods and goddesses momentarily protect you against
with nonsensical titles, such as \@Stupid Uthbran mud slug.  \@ The more
nonsensical the insults the better, and if you add creativity to the insult
by making the title have no apparent point of reference to be determined (at
least by the most low-browed of adventurers), your enemies will be calling
you a Fool in no time.  
  
Lastly: Master Wind in a way an archmage of air could never do.  The best
way to do so is by stuffing your breeches with down, placing a chicken\@s egg
upon a sturdy four-legged oaken chair and perching carefully upon the egg
with your posterior.  Practice this until you can master your body control
and balance so much so you do not break the egg.  Once achieved, the art of
carefully controlled wind must be perfected.  You\@ll know perfection is
complete when, with just one \@Crash of Arms\@ you\@re able to break the egg
without splitting your breeches.  
  
Then and only then will you have yet another deadly skill added to your

Now that I am at the crest of my career as a bardess and my name is known
upon the lips of Var Bandor merchant, Earendam scholar and Krilin soldier
alike, hardly a day passes when, sitting upon the couch composing song and
lay before the fireplace in the Bard\@s Guild, a young and too eager
adventurer with varying degrees of musical and vocal talent wanders before
my warm fire to pose a question.  
  
More often than not, the young adventurer asks how he (and it is always a
\@he\@, never a \@she\@) can make a profitable and respectable living as a bard.
So, I usually lay my ivory quill pen fashioned from an indigo feather of an
aelin Kor Thrandir ambassador upon my thinly-cut spider-silk composition
paper and tell the young adventurer how a professionally trained voice at
the Earendam Bardic Collegium along with a creative, quick mind and
impeccable acting skills do not guarantee success, fame and fortune unless
dedication and hard work augment the training.  And nearly two out of three
times, the young adventurer shakes his head during my exposition, rudely
interrupting me with one form or another of the question, \@So then, what
must I do to gain the title Fool of Avendar?  \@ 
  
Instead of wasting words and breath upon these young adventurers with little
talent and desire - most quit The Guild within a cycle of Lunus, only to pick
up the sword, the dagger or the flame of another guild - I give them this tome
you read now.  Once fully studied, success (in vary degrees, of course) can
be achieved as a fool or idiot by mastering the following three easy steps.

The Shuddeni:
The shuddeni represent an intellect to rival that of our kind.  While we
seek harmony, however, they seek domination.  Their bent is malevolent and
martial.  Theirs is a will to take and to possess.  In civilized lands we
must work against their overtures to gain a measure of authority in
Avendar\@s cities.  In the wilds, we must defend our homes against their
malevolent sorcery and chaja slaves.  Nothing of lasting good comes of a
relationship with a shuddeni.  Keep that in mind during your dealings with
them.  
  
The Srryn:
The srryn are a vicious, but conflicted race.  One branch of their
lineage lurks in the fetid swamps of Avendar, seeking to bring death and
destruction to all other races and their civilizations.  Yet, there are
those who separate themselves from their savage brethren and take up lives
within the cities, and some even protecting the Laws of Iandir that define
them.  It is fortunate that the these two disparate cultures are easily
discerned from one another.
~
E
volume4~
The Humans:
Humans, taken as a race, are unpredictable and fickle.  Taken
individually, once you understand their goals, they can be influenced as any
other might be.  They wax in power as a race and it would be best for all
that they are well-advised on how to use this newfound influence.  It would
not do for it to be wielded at the expense of order and peace.  
  
The Kankoran:
The Kankoran share our affinity for the wild places of Avendar, but as a
race they oppose ordered societies on principle.  Many of our less involved
brethren live amongst them unmolested, but those of us who guard the Laws
of Iandir that our people brought to Avendar often find ourselves matching
our spells with their blades.  It is an unfortunate state of affairs, but
neither side will yield in this seemingly endless conflict.  
  
The Nefortu:
It is best to exercise the wisdom of Iandir when dealing with the
Nefortu.  Deception is bred in their bones, but vision is infused into ours.
With sound judgement we may sift the truth from the words of a nefortu as a
Ryarl panner may sift gold from mere dross.  In the civil courts of the land
we must work quietly to reign in their devious schemes.  It is well for
Avendar\@s cities we are so vigilant.
~
E
volume3~
The Chaja:
If the alatharya exercise their might without vision, the chaja do so
without mercy.  They are better manipulated from afar or avoided altogether.
Such physical might coupled with a vicious temperament make them unsafe
company.  Those that serve their shuddeni masters still are angry at their
bondage.  Those that have escaped are angry at once being bound, and those
born free are merely angry.  
  
The Ch\@taren:
The ch\@taren live their lives at the manic pace suiting one of the
shortest-lived races.  It may not be out of the question for me to witness
many generations of one of these golden-skinned families in the course of my
life.  They are erratic but well-meaning, a few zealously so.  Their chaotic
nature makes them difficult to work with.  They lack patience or a
willingness to take a long view of a conflict.  Fortunately they also lack
malice, which makes many of their other qualities more tolerable.  
  
The Ethron:
No other race is so akin to us, yet so different as the hearty and
sagacious ethron.  Physically, we are opposites.  They are short, stout and
solid while we are taller and of a more scholarly making.  But we share a
wisdom and appreciation for the wilds of Avendar that transcends our obvious
differences.  Even those of us who reside in a city often feel the tug for
the solitude of the forest.  Many an ethron village has a caladaran advisor
residing in the nearby woods.

Training/Patrols -
  
If I may be so bold, I would like to suggest a modification of our training
and patrol schedules.  Currently guard duty schedules overlap exactly
fifteen minutes.  I would like to see more variation and randomness to our
changing of the guard, as well as the number of soldiers in training or off
duty at any given time.  I fear any spies may easily discern our exact
schedules and an assault planned accordingly would be devestating.  I am
also concerned by the lack of a static guard at the main fountain.  Despite
our regular patrolling of the main thoroughfare, there are too many
opportunities available to slip poison into our water supply.  
  
These are the issues I wished to address at this time, I will be sure to
regularly inform you of any new information or suggestions I may come
across.

To: Mjr. Chartoff and Lt. Cmdr. Velitius
Major, Commander,
  
Over the course of the past few months in my new position, I\@ve taken it
upon myself to familiarize myself more fully with the workings and logistics
of keeping this fortress combat-ready from day to day.  I have begun
thorough inspections of both our training facilities as well as the general
supply of food, goods and raw materials needed to keep our forces at their
peak preparedness.  I\@ve written down my findings and personal suggestions
concerning these issues in the following report.  
  
                            {R**{WConfidential{R**{n
  
Internal/External Supplies -
  
I\@ve made note of who and where we are getting our supplies from.  In
general, supply caravans have been originating from Earendam, mostly stocked
with foodstuffs, clothing and miscellaneous implements needed to run the
daily workings of the fortress.  Krilin and Var Bandor have established 
secure trade routes, providing us mostly with raw materials such as iron ore
and leather.  While I am certain you are already familiar with such information,
I wish to put it to paper, for I am concerned with several of our trading 
practices.  
  
It seems Krilin is charging us double the going price on iron ore and
leather, due to the hazardous conditions of passing over the Brintor
mountains.  I have discovered that Krilin is charging Var Bandor less than
half of what we are being charged.  Further investigation has shown that we
can reduce our costs by nearly twenty-five percent if we purchase iron ore
and leather from Var Bandor, rather than direct from Krilin.

INTELLIGENCE ON THE SUCCUBUS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \#ASHA\# INTERCEPTED BETWEEN
SKRASHMANU GRANROG AND JINRESH HERETIC:
  
Vanguard, Pentagram, Coven:
  
Lord Keeper Akashu Thissa\@Ny, and ultimately, Lord Dragon Tal Mar Ki\@yadi, I
must apologize for my actions that circumvented council, this shall not be
repeated.  Keeper, you seem to possess the most knowledge upon the subject
of Asha the Damned, if you would share with Us now, it might prove useful
later when another situation arises and hesitation will cost Us.  
  
For those of whom were fortunate to not be present during the Enemy Siren\@s
visit to Our Halls, these are the events that had transpired.  Her stealthy
entrance is betrayed by the fluttering of wings.  While the Keeper and I
were conversing in the halls, she drifted in, and wordlessly dropped a
crystal hexagon pendant.  The Keeper picked it up, and from there, chaos
broke out.  The Keeper appeared to be possessed, speaking in a manner that
was alien to his nature.  The initiates also fell under this influence,
yelling like idiots.  The Keeper believes this to be the influence of
Serachel, but I believe otherwise; as the Lord Dragon has noted keenly, it
is ultimately speculation.  The chaos eventually subsided as the Archmagus
Lilisa took control over the matter.  She gave Us orders to destroy the
pendant, yet at the time we lacked the power to do such.  I do not know what
happened to the pendant afterwards.
~
E
folder2~
Upon her second visit, Lords Dragon, Keeper, and Siren were present, Soldier
Fara\@thak came in for reinforcement later on in the episode.  Again, she
dropped the pendant, and without consulting the council, I destroyed it as
Lilisa\@s order as prior Dragon burned within my memory as though she had
given them last night.  To my amazement, I was able to shatter it with a
single slam of my thickest tentacle.  Then the fluttering of a thousand
birds filled the Tabernacle and Asha coalesced into physical form before Us.
She merely smiled at me, as I had unwittingly unleashed her from what the
Keeper later informed me to be the prison erected by Serachel.  Immediately
thereafter, she attempted to choke me with a lash of woven ch\@taren sinew, I
retreated, she then attacked Our Lord Dragon, I returned with the aura and
the weave of Malyn.  She fluttered away, only to return the next night.  
  
The Enemy Siren revealed two things that she desired: naturally, my seat;
and impossibly, to subject Our Lord Serachel to the same fate he carved for
her miserable soul.  In truth, both wishes are pure folly, the Halls of the
Knowing have not welcomed her presence for eons, why she would seek my seat
now is beyond reason.  She then began a feeble attempt to sway Lord
Fara\@thak, and while there was no threat of her succeeding, I tired of her
mocking presence and had Malyn courier a message for me.  Again, for this I
beg forgiveness, but after she revealed her deluded intentions, I did not
think she would offer Us anymore except further annoyance.  
  
She will make another appearance, she has promised me that.  Let Us maintain
wariness for the Enemy Siren, let Us glean more knowledge upon her, so that
We may better guard Our Halls from her schemes and ultimately, continue her
agony, pain, and loneliness for eternity.  
  
The True Siren,
Jinresh

After the bookkeeping and payments were handled, a ritual was performed.  Chanting
could be heard from inside the guildhall and a brilliant light seemed to fill 
the very air.  Moments after the ritual ended, Ksaukach attacked, not realizing 
that the binding between him and his fetish had been twisted and turned against him.   He was driven off quickly and easily; likely to be the victim of another of the 
Scourge now that he was so greatly weakened. 
  
It was decided by those present to not seek him out, and let his own evil consume him. 
  
-The End- 
  
Author\@s Note:
  
I, Taldris Grevnor, follower of Chadraln, swear by the Hourglass that this record 
is both true and, to the best of my knowledge, complete.
~
E
book16~
{yChapter 6:  The Return to Arch-Mage Shilrin {n
  
After Ksaukach\@s demise, the warband made its way to Earendam to present the 
scorched-bone fetish and bauble of gleaming gold to Arch-Mage Shilrin. 
  
The Arch-Mage stated that, after she was done, wearing the fetish would weaken 
Ksaukach rather than strengthening him - implying that he would be regaining 
the fetish, and that he would be restored to life.  This news was not 
particularly gladdening for any of those involved in killing him the first time. 
  
The Arch-Mage offered fifty platinum in reward for the efforts of each member 
of the warband.  Malenrion accepted the coin.  Cel asked that his be given to 
the Champions of Aramril, to aid in reestablishing themselves.  Anrisa declined 
the money, saying it could be better spent elsewhere, on troops for the Surface
Alliance.  Jaslia requested the honor of her name being known in the realms, 
which Arch-Mage Shilrin denied being able to help with.  Taldris asked that the 
Arch-Mage commend, and recommend, him to the Grand Library of Earendam.
~
E
book15~
Finally, the warband entered Ksaukach\@s chambers.  A yaril moved - whether by 
happenstance or divine aidinto the room behind them and effectively halted 
any attempts that might have been made to reinforce Ksaukach.  The arch-mage 
himself, despite Guildmaster Lenimbar\@s efforts, was still a force to be 
reckoned with.  A demonic guard called a Syndic was with him, and it proved 
necessary to dispatch the acid-spitting beast before engaging Ksaukach himself.  
However, with Jaslia\@s healing, both demon and demon-caller were dispatched far  more easily than the warband had expected.
~
E
book14~
Taking full advantage of Ksaukach\@s sudden weakness, an assault was launched 
on the Spirit Palace, in the hopes of catching Ksaukach off-balance and 
defeating him before he could recover fully from the earlier fighting.  
Malenrion, Cel, Anrisa, and Taldris smashed through waves of shuddeni, and 
their chaja slaves, greatly aided by Jaslia\@s healing magics and despite the 
shouted orders by Scourge leaders to kill him first.  Though the shuddeni had 
reacted far more quickly than they had to the first raid meant to recover 
the black crystal, it was obvious they had not expected the attack.   
   
Perhaps Ksaukach feared -- rightfully -- admitting to the Scourge his sudden 
weakness and vulnerability and assumed that the minimal guard already in place 
would be sufficient to deter attack.  If so, he was wrong.  The chaja fell 
easily, and the shuddeni scarcely less so, even with their attempts to break 
past the front-line fighters to assault Jaslia.  Further, and to the great 
glee of those who had fought to recover the black crystal previously, many of 
the yaril broke free of shuddeni control, turning on their masters and adding 
to the confusion of the assault.
~
E
book13~
The shuddeni arch-mage noticed Guildmaster Lenimbar\@s scrying, and traveled 
quickly to Var Bandor to attack the Guildmaster.  Ksaukach summoned a huge 
C\@thsa worm, which quickly began birthing lesser worms and their spawn, into 
Var Bandor.  The fighting was brutal, with many of the Var Bandor guard dying 
to the worms.  Despite the havoc caused by the demonic assault, the Guard 
acquitted itself well, fighting a slow retreat to give civilians time to flee 
the creatures.  At the height of the pitched battle, Ksaukach himself attacked,
and was intercepted by Captain Bromrin, who found himself hard-pressed by the 
combination of the arch-mage and his huge demonic worm.  
  
The worm itself proved impossible to kill, as some power was healing it every 
time it grew weak, so some broke off fighting the creature to attack Ksaukach 
himself.  Others continued facing the worm, distracting it from doing further 
damage to the city, an inglorious but necessary task.  Ksaukach was shocked 
and horrified to realize his sudden weakness, and under relentless assault, 
was forced to withdraw.  He called on the final great healing magic present in 
the fetish, saving his life, then teleported away from his attackers.
~
E
book12~
{yChapter 5:  Guildmaster Lenimbar, and the Doom of Ksaukach{n
   
Motivated by the fighting, Malenrion, Anrisa, Libicus, Alamer, and Taldris
traveled to Var Bandor to have the golden bauble prepared for use against 
Ksaukach. 
  
Guildmaster Lenimbar took the bauble of gleaming gold and said he could use 
it to sympathetically affect Ksaukach\@s scorched bone fetish, weakening him 
-- hopefully -- enough for him to be slain. 
  
It seemed the bone fetish was a combination of shards of bone from a water 
dragon -- the beasts off the coast of Alensha were considered a possible 
source -- and Ksaukach\@s blood.  The fetish evidently possessed a number of
powers based on water-magic, including defenses and great healing spells in 
addition to Ksaukach\@s own void-magic. 
  
Guildmaster Lenimbar detailed the abilities of the scorched bone fetish (the 
sanctuary aura and occasionally healing powers) that would be weakened or 
removed by the bauble\@s enchantments.  However, he warned that the fetish 
retained one great healing spell.
~
E
book11~
Finally, a mighty voice said, simply, \#We ride.\#  The voice came
seemingly from the sky Levishul himself said nothing, but immediately took
flight into the heavens.  
  
Shortly thereafter, the sounds of a mighty battle could be heard, though
despite the best efforts of Taldris, Cel, Malenrion, Anrisa, and Libicus,
they could not determine where the battle took place.  
  
Travelling to Earendam, they were informed by Arch-Mage Shilrin of the
Spirit Palace that a war was taking place between the angelic and demonic
armies, and that it had bled over into Avendar.  The Arch-Mage also asserted
that nothing could be done by mere mortals -- an unnerving notion, as
Taldris pointed out that wars between humans are quite destructive enough,
and a war between such powerful beings could be far worse.  
  
Perhaps motivated by the idea of heavenly -- or hellish -- destruction being 
rained down upon them, the warband was motivated to renew preparations for 
the next attack on Ksaukach.
~
E
book10~
{yChapter 4:  The War of the Heavens {n
  
Though not directly related to the fight against the Scourge, the arrival
of the archangel Levishul on this world is of definite historical interest.
    
A brilliant flash of light appeared in the eastern sky, and Taldris made
his way from Krilin Fortress to the coast.  At the Brintor Crossroads, he
encountered the herald of the angelic host, Levishul. 
  
Archangel Levishul appeared as a golden-haired, bronze-skinned figure. 
His eyes were a pupil-less silver, and he bore two pairs of wings, one
sprouting from his shoulders and another from his waist.  These were not
aelin wings, nor nefortu, but wings of silver and light.  Clad in ch\@lonin
mail, silvery sandals, and a belt of diamonds and pearls, the archangel bore
a silvered sling in one hand and a silver trumpet in the other.  He stopped
before Taldris at the crossroads, and blew the trumpet, at which point a
great murmur could be heard from the heavens themselves, resonating in the
soul of all who heard.
~
E
book9~
{yChapter 3:  The Void Shade {n
   
Cel, Malenrion, Anrisa, and Taldris entered the Tower of Arisuth seeking
a Greater Void Shade.  The creature, once found, proved highly resistant to
attacks both mental and physical.  
  
The void shade itself struck with negative energy attacks and fears,
weakening and inhibiting the actions of those fighting it, though not
inflicting diseases and curses as was expected.  In the end, the battle
proved long though not overly arduous.
~
E
book8~
Guildmaster Lenimbar suggested if a golden bauble could be acquired from
a greater void shade, as in Archmage Shilrin\@s missive, it might be possible
to weaken Ksaukach\@s defenses sufficiently for him to be defeated and the
bone fetish recovered. 
    
Ksaukach\@s powers, even with the Scourge ritual incomplete, were
sufficiently devastating to add a definite impetus to the need to strike
against the shuddeni forces again.  The difficulty with a counterattack,
unfortunately, was two-fold; first, finding a greater void shade, and
second, mustering the strength to slay it.
~
E
book7~
{yChapter 2:  The Assassins {n
  
While traveling near the Fens with Azktharun, Taldris was assaulted by a
Scourge assassin, a hateblade.  Taldris and Azktharun had become separated,
but Taldris was able to beat off the hateblade\@s attack despite having been
weakened by an encounter in the Fens.
    
Retreating to Var Bandor to regroup with Azktharun and recuperate,
Taldris was assaulted by a hateblade once again -- perhaps the same one,
healed, perhaps another.  This hateblade died after underestimating the
psionicist\@s powers. 
  
Ksaukach himself showed up, and Taldris fled to Earendam, where he
recuperated from his wounds and gathered Azktharun.  Returning to Var Bandor
just in time to see the ch\@taren air templar Hyahi taunting Ksaukach, he and
Azktharun attacked the shuddeni.  
  
Though they had known they were outmatched by the Ksaukach, they had
underestimated by how much.  Ksaukach quickly drove them both off,
off-handedly killing the ch\@taren air templar Hyahi at the same time. 
Taldris\@ shouts for help were answered by Captain Bromrin and a number of
Var Bandor guards, while Hyahi called the guildmasters from the spirit and
water guilds to the fight.  The combination was sufficient to drive Ksaukach
off, though witnesses suggested the shuddeni was still barely injured in the
fighting, while Guildmistress Aemi fell.

{yA Chronicle of War Against the Scourge:  The Defeat of Ksaukach{n
{D.{n               From the pen of Taldris Grevnor 
  
Chapter 1:  The Raid on the Spirit Palace 
  
Preparations for this raid were initiated by the following note from Archmage Shilrin: 
The shuddeni war-mongers, known as the Scourge, have for too long occupied
the Spirit Palace.  Our forces scattered, we are unable to challenge them
directly.  Our mages have divined a way in which to weaken the foul
creatures, however.   
  
A magical object, described as a crystal by our diviners, is being used to
assure shuddeni control over their Yarils.  Its very existence ensures this
control, unfortunately, and it cannot be permanently destroyed.  This is a
call for adventurers to wrest this magical object from the shuddeni priests.
Should this object be recovered, write a note to myself and the Immortal
gods of Light and keep it safe until a safe meeting can be arranged.  A
reward will be discussed at this meeting.   
  
-Archmage Shilrin
~
E
book2~
The actual attack, however, was the immediate response to a Scourge void
templar launching a raid on the city of Var Bandor.  One witness suggested
the attack was a slave-gathering effort.  Whatever its purpose, it was
beaten back by Malenrion, Cel, and Azktharun. 
  
Shortly thereafter, Iljir, Cel, Varthog, Azktharun, Aesty and Taldris
Grevnor assaulted the Spirit Palace under Iljirs leadership.  The initial
fighting was entirely one-sided, with chaja slaves dying en masse to the
organized warband.  However, as they penetrated further into the Spirit
Palace, they began to encounter shuddeni rather than mere chaja slaves, and
progress slowed.  
  
Even so, the Scourge seemed disorganized and unprepared for the attack. 
Perhaps the void templar who had attacked Var Bandor was a key officer, or
perhaps the arrogant Scourge simply could not conceive of mere surface
dwellers daring to attack them.  The latter theory was supported by a
particular occurrence; a Scourge leader single-handedly attacked the warband
in response to taunting by Azktharun.  This was a fatal error, and he barely
slowed the party\@s assault.
~
E
book3~
Two occurrences of particularly brutal fighting took place.  The first
was in Archmage Shilrins former chambers, now occupied by a sizeable force
of Scourge battlemages and their superiors.  The worst of the fighting,
however, was in the uppermost part of the Spirit Palaces library, against
the High Priest of Yithoul and a High Priestess of the Scourge.  Several
assaults were required to break into the chamber, but once the Scourge
spellcasters were engaged hand-to-hand by experienced melee fighters
supported by a healer, the fight became a forgone conclusion.  The High
Priest of Yithoul fell, the crystal was captured, and the warband retreated
over a carpet of Scourge and Chaja corpses. 
  
Captain Bromrin of the Var Bandor Guard approached us shortly after our
departure from the Spirit Palace, suggesting that we take the crystal to
Shilrin immediately, or arrange for a time of meeting.  This suggestion was
met with ill-favor, as certain members of the warband had other notions of
possible uses for the crystal.  Shortly, however, an event took place that
may have led to disaster.
~
E
book4~
Cel had acquired the crystal from Iljir and left the warband, taking it
away for further study rather than handing it over to the former residents
of the Spirit Palace.  He said he was taking it to a deep hole for further
study - the Coven of the Shunned, as it turned out, to be examined by fellow
psionicist Coya.  Great dismay ensued amongst some members of the party,
fearing betrayal by Cel.  Suggestions ranged from \#wait and see\# to \#assault
the Coven immediately!\#.
  
Eventually, it was agreed that a report to Archmage Shilrin should be
made.  Before that could happen, however, Cel returned with the crystal. 
Nothing of real use had been learned about the crystal, save that it
appeared to only be useful to one of the shuddeni.  However, Cel noticed
something out of the corner of his eye when handing the crystal to Taldris,
and it was discovered the artifact could be used to determine the presence
of good or evil in someones spirit.  This discovery did not overly-excite
any of the pragmatists in the warband, and debate resumed over its eventual
fate.  Some wished to hold onto it for further study, while others simply
were opposed to giving any object of power over to the servants of the Gods
of Light. 
  
In the end, the \#decision\# was to give the crystal into the protection of 
Iljir and Aesty, while negotiations took place with the Spirit Palace.
~
E
book5~
Shortly thereafter, Iljir and Aesty both disappeared without any word
sent to their allies.  Great consternation followed, as the others who had
fought to capture the crystal worried about its fate -- perhaps tellingly,
concern for Iljir and Aesty was distinctly secondary. 

Several months passed before further events.  Eventually, Iljir
reappeared, and he and Cel took the crystal to Archmage Shilrin.  Iljir\@s
manner was described as paranoid and furtive; he seemed to expect attack by
his former comrades.  Given the nature of some of those who had aided in
recovering the crystal, and the concerns at Iljir\@s extended disappearance,
his paranoia may have been justified.  At that time, Cel was given the
reward money to be split amongst those who had participated in the raid. 
Further, a missive was sent from Shilrin stating how much of a reward each
person should expect to receive, and to speak to Cel to collect the coin.  
  
As for the crystal itself, Archmage Shilrin purified it, causing the
shuddeni hold over the yaril to be weakened.  The Archmage stated that,
occasionally, the yaril would attack their former masters - though at other
times they would remain bound.  This would force the shuddeni to choose
between losing a very effective weapon and risking the yaril turning on them
at inopportune moments.
~
E
book6~
Despite the effectiveness of this raid, however, the Scourge were
disinclined to accept such a blow without reprisals.  The following missive,
also from Archmage Shilrin, calls adventurers to prepare for a Scourge
counterattack and take steps to defeat the Scourge again: 

The Shuddeni Scourge have been dealt a blow with the weakening of their
magical artifact.  A group of adventurers and mercenaries, Cel, Taldris,
Iljir, Azktharun, Aesty and Varthog, recovered the black crystal from the
palace.  With the magics of spirit it has been purified and their hold over
the Yaril\@s weakened.   
    
The Scourge has begun to prepare for a reprisal, it has been learned.  They
have finished the creation of an artifact to empower the void scholar
Ksaukach.  Forged by their dark magics and bound to his soul, this fetish of
scorched bone imbues him with considerably more arcane might.  Given time to
master it, Ksaukach will doubtlessly seek to press the attack. 
  
Adventurers are sought to recover this artifact from the magus that we might
find a way to exploit its sympathetic link to him to weaken his powers
rather than strengthen them.  One of these fetishes is needed for the
ritual, as well as a golden bauble taken from a greater void shade.   
Those who have gained both these objects should inform me and the Immortals
of Light via missive.

Arkhural\@s predilection with fear and suffering appealed to almost all of
the nefortu, mirroring as it did most of their rudimentary shreds of
culture. Over the next few years, the nefortu had moved far along the path
to civilization. The first nefortu to be introduced to the shuddeni had
become powerful patriarchs in their own right, and had implemented a
meritocracy of sorts. Stature in society was largely dependent on skill in
trickery.
  
After the nefortu had developed yet more, the shuddeni returned to them as
ambassadors and friends, bearing gifts. They took from the infant community its
greatest assassins and devotees to the Darkheart, molding them further into
terrifying instruments of death. These elite of the assassins became known as
the Crimson Hand, both from the livid red tattoo each of them bore on the back
of the neck, and from the blood that was spilled by them. The cabal as a whole
was independent of any authority, preferring rather to operate as mercenaries.
In the dozens number the times that shuddeni history was altered by a whisper
and a purse finding their way to a Crimson Hand.
~
E
folder1~
\#The nefortu and shuddeni tongues are very similar, suggesting a long
history of connection between their cultures.  This seems to have begun long
before the emergence of the shuddeni during the war of Night, and involves a
secretive cabal of assassins known as the Crimson Hand.  
  
The origins of the nefortu race, like those of most others, are shrouded in
mystery, but it is safe to assume that their profoundest history began in
darkness and caves.  Their bat-like wings and almost preternaturally acute
sense of hearing lend themselves most excellently to life underground.  The
nefortu body is also gifted with an impressive degree of flexibility and
speed.  Taken all together, the nefortu is uniquely suited for a career in
concealment and assassination.  
  
 Eons ago, an unknown shuddeni reached the same conclusion. The nefortu of
 his day, as has been determined from other studies, were a primitive race, 
even more so than the srryn of Sythtys. He realized the potential in these 
winged primitives; the statue, as it were, residing in the block of stone. 
Taking in a dozen nefortu, he introduced them to the shuddeni language and 
culture. After a surprisingly brief period, they had mastered the language, 
demonstrating minds scarcely less dextrous than their bodies. Within a 
period of a few months, he had trained them in those arts practiced by the 
hateblades and sent them back among their fellows, to whom they brought 
knowledge of the religion of Arkhural.
~
E
folder3~
After many years of this, the shuddeni at last burst forth onto the surface of
Avendar in the War of Night. The Crimson Hand never accompanied the army in
battle, but was always willing to remove enemy commanders for a price. Their
efficiency and ruthlessness soon led to the name instilling fear above ground
as well as below it. With the end of the war came retribution against the
shuddeni and all those who had served with or under them. Myriads of nefortu
were killed in the battles under the earth, with many of the survivors fleeing
southward, some not stopping until they had reached the desert. 
  
In the centuries since, the nefortu have primarily devoted themselves to
mischief and sadism of a far pettier nature, with thievery much more common
than murder.  Today, the race consists almost entirely of thieves and
lazeabouts, with the occasional raving madman thrown in for variety. The
Crimson Hand, however, escaped the purges largely intact, and has been
concealed ever since. Only very rarely are its members sought out for  service,
but when they are known to be active, few indeed are the rulers who sleep
soundly.\#

{D.{y               as recorded by Gaeltos Eltir-Qalon, Fool of Avendar{n
  
I write this during my travails in the bitter northlands, wandering about and
seeing the world.  Anviraan, shaman of pack Ryarl, has agreed to speak with me
despite several affronts I seem to have made with my insolence and my jesting.
  
I seek to transcribe his words exactly, though I beg forgiveness for the errors
I shall undoubtedly make.
  
\#I am Anviraan, Shaman and Lore-Master of the Ryarl. My father\@s grandsire was
Arkerat, my granddam was Krolin\@ya. My father\@s sire was Arkeraan, and his mate
Anvira. My father was Anviror, and my dam Grinshek. My son is Anvirot, and he
shall be Wise.\#
  
Author\@s note: It seems that lineage and blood are important among the Pack,
for purposes of continuity and presence. Respect is given to those who can
recite their family lines back for generations. This does not seem to be out of
any sense of nobility or even age, but a mere acknowledgment that that which
has lived long and evolved is strong and worthy of continued life -- perhaps a
pragmatic sense of \@nobility\@ as exercised by aelin and humans.
  
\#This is the story of the Four Winds, the spirits who exist to do homage to
Girikha. Their names are blessed in Her mouth, and in the mouths of the Pack,
for they are free as we can only hope to be some day. I tell you these names
that you remember and tell them to others, for their stories are wisdom.
~
E

\#Khaharit is the name given to the south wind, hot and dry, the bringer of
change and war, he who blows when war is afoot. He sings with sand and dust,
and sometimes blots the very sun.  \#Ugok is the dull east wind, the constant
breeze on which Shamans smell death. Ill fortune does she carry, for Ugok has
always been sullen, and never forgets a grudge.  \#Rorurahuari, the Dancer,
dances out of the west, and she is wild and fey. Sailors curse her name, for
she makes toys of their ships and shatters the seas with her passage. Worship
the delight of her music, but do not remain in it overlong.  \#Hkaroj, the
bitter north wind, is frigid and cold. Strongest of the four, his fingers
pierce the thickest of fur and chill the wildest of hearts. Warriors turn to
his serenity when their wrath runs over-hot, and in him is found power.  These
are the names of the four. Let them remain in your heart and your mind, and
always be at your back.\#
  
\#And so it happened that the four winds were talking one day, and the boastful
South wind bespake unto his brethren, and he said \#Hearken to me! For I will
make our mother a gift, and the glory of it will shame you in her eye. For I am
Khaharit, and I am grand!\#.
  
\#The other three were scornful, and gelid Hkaroj replied \#Glittering Khaharit,
hear me. We are as equals in our mother\@s eye, and our strengths are varied but
of the same puissance. Stir not up malcontent, for the world is at peace.\# Ugok
heard, and saw, and she spake out, slow and cunning: \#But North Wind, my
brother, my blood, fear do I hear in your voice and see in your face! Surely
you are not threatened by the simple reverence of the Windmother, gifts which
shall only greaten Her?\#. For she always loves to hear of strife, and revels in
discord.
~
E
scroll3~
Author\@s note: This seems to relate to other myths of the god Tzajai, who is
always spoken of as accompanying or being accompanied by the east wind. In
Harrudim, Tzajai is know by two epithets: It Which Rides the Easterly Currents,
and That Damned Ruffian.
  
\#And Rorurahuari merely laughed at the silliness of her siblings, and Hkaroj\@s
pride, slow to anger, was stirred. He bespake \#Very well, then, I, too, shall
make a gift for the Mother, and let it be seen that it will be viewed with more
favor! For I am powerful, and I see the farthest; verily, to the end of time
does my sight run.\# And the other two declared their intent to also seek the
best gifts which Avendar might afford. Great was the haste with which those
Four winds parted company, and the very noise of it leveled the Kal
h\@Ari\@en\@haka, which means the Plains of Arien, or Departing.\#
  
\#Westward to her home sped Rorurahuari, calling as she flew. Unto her came all
the birds of the sky, spinning their calls together, and from each she asked
for one feather. To her these were given, and she did gather the birdmusic in
her own voice, and from it she wove a great Song: on that day was composed the
Lay of the Sky-Kin. Each contributor, from the humble sparrow to the mighty
eagle, had its voice heard, and the noise of the Song is said to lift mortals
into the air to dance with the delight of the West Wind, to dance in the realm
of the Sky-Kin. And of their feathers she wove a headdress, and prepared to
present them to Girikha the Blessed.\#
~
E
scroll4~
\#Khaharit sprinted southwards, and surveyed his domain. And he flew to and fro,
to and fro, over all the sky given him, and he gathered together a mighty bank
of cloud -- everything which the Southlands held. From this he twisted, and he
wrought, and together he wove a beautiful gown.  Lightning ran the weft, and
thunder the warp, and its pattern was the pattern written in the unique,
devilish breezes of the southern lands. And all his lands were laid bare to the
sun, but his heart was enamoured with the cloudweave which he was to give to
Girikha, the blessed.\#
  
\#Pensive and measured was Ugok\@s return to her eastern home, for she does not
hurry, and deep are her thoughts. Envy ran in her heart, for while she smiled
to see the rivalry she had provoked, she was not as swift as Rorurahuari, nor
as aggressive as Khaharit, nor as wise nor strong as Hkaroj. And she came down
to Avendar, and took up mud and ice and lava and a number of other primal
substances, and breathed malice and jealousy into them. And she made the
Shurbul, the dragons, and the leviathan, and the yorna, and a number of other
beasts. Her spirit of spite and patience is reflected in their minds, for they
are all beings which desire but do not enjoy that which they accrue. And she
gathered them to her bosom, for she planned to give them to Girikha the
Blessed.\#
  
\#Straight and true ran Hkaroj, not to his home, but upwards, into the Outer
Heavens, where Iandir and Jolinn hold little power, and where Girikha, She Who
Is The Wind, seldom reaches. Thin is the substance there, and colder even than
mighty Hkaroj. And he sought far, and was nearly consumed by the tremendous
Void, yet at the uttermost limit of his tolerance, he found what he sought, and
did bring it back to Avendar. In his grasp was clutched a brilliant star,
coursing with the pure light of the Outer Heavens. At his command, though he
was forevermore weakened by his travel, he did bind it with a band of ice and
set it as a ring. For such a thing of beauty he thought worthy of Girikha, the
Blessed.\#
~
E
scroll5~
\#This is the story of the Four Winds, the spirits who exist to do homage to
Girikha. Their names are blessed in Her mouth, and in the mouths of the Pack,
for they are free as we can only hope to be some day. I tell you these names
that you might remember and tell them to others, for their stories are wisdom.
  
\#And then the four did converge again in the Heart of Nature, where Girikha sat
in repose. And they each sought foolishly to press in on her where she sat, and
the force of their coming was as an assault to her person. And she rose up in
wroth and in anger, and they were scattered back and dazed by her presence. She
spoke to them \#My children, my winds, why do you rush in this manner? Why am I
pressed thus? What crisis tears this plane, that you must come to me like
this?\# And they were ashamed, each in their own way, and were calmed in that
shame.
  
\#And boastful Khaharit spoke forward, saying \#Mother, we have come to You with
gifts, and we desire you to evaluate them, and see which finds favor in your
eyes. For mighty is Your arm, and unto You is given the glory of the wilds and
the freedom of the soul.\# And Girikha looked upon her children, and did see the
meaning behind their actions. She laughed at their actions, as the child-bearer
laughs at a pup which has found snow which is too deep, and flounders in its
own mistakes. \#Come, then, and show me what you have brought to me, for I wish
to see and I wish to know.\#
~
E
scroll6~
\#Fey Rorurahuari sprang forth, and cried \#My Lady and my Mother, take from me
this Song, for it is crafted of the voice of the Wilds!\#. And she presented the
headdress unto Girikha, and opened her mouth and Sang the Lay of the Skykin,
and the entire world did fall silent to hear it. Her siblings were gladdened in
their hearts to hear it, and Girikha smiled.
  
\#Proud Khaharit went before Girikha when the Song was done, and from the pouch
at his red belt he pulled the gown of cloudweave, and it seared with lightning
and roared with thunder, and its patterning showed the delight of the rising
sun and the glory of the storm. And when he shook it open, his brethren were
gladdened in their hearts, for such a thing of beauty pleased them, and Girikha
smiled.
  
\#Cunning Ugok glided forth, and said \#Mother, see these beasts which I have
made for you, the wild and the dangerous and the hard, creatures which will
worship you in their perfection, for their form is perfect, and they will live
long. For what is the Hunt without things worthy of Hunting? Let your followers
hunt the fast, and the strong, and the perilous.\# And her brethren saw the
craftsmanship writ in the forms of the slumbering beasts, and saw them as a
goodness, and Girikha smiled.\#
~
E
scroll7~
\#Cold Hkaroj blew forth, and he lifted his gift without a word. Its light shone
forth, and the entire world was bathed with the brightness of the star. And the
purity and the working of the ring pleased the eyes and hearts of his siblings,
for perfection was to be found there. And Girikha took up the headdress onto
her head, and placed the mantle about her body, and on her finger she set the
ring, and in her lap the creatures, and she smiled.\#
  
\#This is the story of the Four Winds, the spirits who exist to do homage to
Girikha. Their names are blessed in Her mouth, and in the mouths of the Pack,
for they are free as we can only hope to be some day. I tell you these names
that you might remember and tell them to others, for their stories are wisdom.
  
\#Then did Blessed Girikha raise her head, and she looked upon her children,
tense with expectation.  She saw their desire for praise, and their
selfishness, and their love for her, and she thought.  \#My Children, my Winds,
I receive your offerings, and they are things of beauty and of power. They do
me honor as you do me honor, but I am troubled.\# She paused, and the knell of
these words in the hearts of the winds was as the greatest of thunderclaps.
  
\#\#Rorurahuari, you have taken from each of the birds a feather, the guiding
pinfeather of the tail.  And with it you have made me a gift which is beautiful
and which cannot be ungiven, but the Sky-kin can no longer soar in the plane of
air as they once did. Learn of the harm your sacrifice has done to my
creations, and be humbled.\#. Then did Girikha form legs for each bird, that
they might live not on the ground as some beasts, but take to the sky as they
once had, with recourse to rest when they tired.
~
E
scroll8~
\#\#Hkaroj, Khaharit. You have each despoiled your homes for my glory, with gifts
that cannot be ungiven. But the Great Wyrm is wrothful at your theft, Hkaroj,
and your cold northlands are now made colder with Its curse. Your southlands,
Khaharit, are lain open and bare to the sun, and the sheltering clouds I have
given you are gone. Harsher indeed will be your lives, and the lives of those
who dwell in your realms. Learn of the harm your sacrifice has done to my
creations, and be humbled.\#. Then did Girikha make hardy the creatures of the
North and the South, wrapping them in fur and scale, slowing their hearts, and
in many other manners adapting them to their newer environs.
  
\#\#Ugok, my daughter, you have made for me wondrous beasts, but they reflect the
worst in your heart. They are hard, and spiteful, and they would do much hurt
to the world, but they are a mighty gift which cannot be ungiven. Learn of the
harm your sacrifice would do to my creations, and be humbled.\#. Then did
Girikha take up the beasts, the dragons, the shurbul, the leviathan, and many
other of their kind and she made them lesser, though still fierce indeed. And
she sowed them far and wide across Avendar, that the strong among her mortal
children might Hunt them in valor and be glad.
  
\#And they looked at what had been done, the four Winds and their Windmother,
and they saw many beautiful things created. Of the hurts done, Girikha had made
greater goods, and the world was bettered. Girikha had not judged any of the
four gifts to be the greater, for none was, and the deciding would accomplish
nothing. Then the four Winds each went their own way, in a manner far more
subdued than in those which they had arrived. None spoke furthermore of who was
to be the greater, or who was more favored, for such is not the way of the
Wild.\#

\#I am Anviraan, Shaman and Lore-Master of the Ryarl. My father\@s grandsire was
Arkerat, my granddam was Krolin\@ya. My father\@s sire was Arkeraan, and his mate
Anvira. My father was Anviror, and my dam Grinshek. My son is Anvirot, and he
shall be Wise. I have told you the story of the Four Winds, the spirits who
exist to do homage to Girikha. Their names are blessed in Her mouth, and in the
mouths of the Pack, for they are free as we can only hope to be someday. I tell
you these names and this story that you might remember and tell them to others,
for their stories are wisdom. Pride is a downfall, and love and respect of
one\@s siblings a goodness. Learn from the mistakes of those who came before
you, and learn doubly so from the mistakes of the divine, for to do so will
make you stronger.
  
\#This is the end of my story.\#
  
  
After telling this, the Pack banked the fire and retired to their dwellings for
the evening, with complete silence blanketing the camp. I do not know if it is
a custom for this silence to happen, or if it was mere coincidence, but there
was an air of reverence in the way they departed, as I have seen an ascetic
light in Jolinnites after a sermon, or perhaps rather as I have seen languor in
the Sensates of Alil after a...group session. I slept well, and woke refreshed,
breakfasting on fresh hare and dried cloudberries before going on my way.

{WChapter One{x

Lisilia looked at her son on the beach, and was momentarily happy.  An
uncharacteristically sunny day on the Uthlin, she had brought her son here
on the insistence of her husband Caval.  

\#Go\#, he\@d said, and let her take the carriage, despite the business in
Earendam that he claimed kept him from going along.  

\#Elspa needs it.  The boy...  The boy\@s too reserved.  He spends too much
time in the library, or talking to his imaginary friends - and too little
doing the things a boy should.\#  

Her husband had paled, and gotten that worried look on his face that had
come ever since the raid last year on their estate that had gutted their
fields.  

Elspa looked up from the sand castle he was making, and looked his green
eyes right at his mother.  

\#He says that he\@s sorry.\#  
~
E
tome2~
Lisilia looked up at her son with a quizzical glance.  \#Who, Elspa?\#  

\#Father does.  He says he\@s sorry\#

And with that, the boy got a very odd look on his face, and begun crying.  

On the way back to the manor house, Elspa would not stop crying.  Reassuring
her son, Lisilia couldn\@t help but wonder - usually the boy had an empathy
for the things around him.  And, the estate\@s finances hadn\@t been well.  

The boy rushed out of his mother\@s arms, up the tall stairwell to his
father\@s study.  Lisilia, struck by the silence in the house, followed
closely behind, and it wasn\@t until she actually entered the room that she
saw what her son had somehow known.  

Her husband, dead, with his bloodstained dagger in his hand.  

And all she could think was...  

\#He says that he\@s sorry.\#  
~
E

{WChapter Two{x 

In the following year, Elspa grew even more withdrawn.  Always carrying his
father\@s signet ring, the boy was never a nuisance, but the finances of what
was now his mother\@s estate grew slim.  As the days past into summer, fewer
and fewer of the manor\@s trappings remained.  

His mother, desperate, remarried.  Agjar Dilis was a burly brute of a man,
rumoured by the servants to have kankoran blood.  Unperturbed by any
pretensions of the fineries of Earendam\@s older families, the man brought
new money and gutter taste to the manor.  

Using Lasilia and the family\@s name and titles, Agjar finally had his access
to society, and, in his mind, a sort of twisted respectability.  Still
scorned for his coarse ways, he began to fixate on Elspa\@s possession of the
family signet ring.  Lasilia would hear him muttering over his drink about
the boy, and how he came between him and respectability.  How the boy was at
fault for all his woes, how...  

As for Elspa, his father\@s suicide had touched the boy in a way that his
mother viewed as unnatural.  

She would often come upon him reading books in his father\@s library,
listening attentively, seemingly to nothing at all.  When questioned, he
would only look at her in blank astonishment, as if \#hearing them\# were the
most natural thing in the world.  
~
E
tome4~
The years passed, and Agjar grew more and more depraved.  With his
fortunes, he squandered money on the basest acts, often performing merely to
shock or horrify his wife.  Elspa took to avoiding him, somehow detecting
the brute\@s presence before he would enter the room.  Agjar grew more and
more jealous of Elspa and his father\@s ring.  One day, in Elspa\@s fifteenth
summer, he came into the manor to find Agjar beating his mother, screaming
obscenities about him taking \#What was his by right!\#  

Something snapped in Elspa, and he looked at Agjar, and saw everything wrong
with the world.  The gluttony, the wanton hedonism, the headlong rush to
self-destruction.  Everything pure within him boiled to a head, and he
raised his hand - in attack or defense he\@d never know, but a jagged bolt of
pure energy slammed into Agjar, knocking him back to the wall.  

Rushing to his mother, he saw that she had already been beaten to death, her
frail ribs broken under the drunken Agjar\@s onslaught.  

Shedding a tear, Elspa walked out of the manor, not looking back, with only
a single thought echoing through his mind.  

Now, there was another voice.

{WChapter Three{x

Elspa wandered the Arien plains, traveling far north to the Brintors,
passing through ancient valleys and even passing through the fabled tower of
Shaendar.  In time, though, he tired of his isolation and turned again to
the ways of man.  

In the silence of his meditation, he had come to master more of his
self-taught art.  Passing the time in silence, he had learned to channel the
mana used by scholars easily and effectively - his meditative techniques
coming in handy for filling his body with what he felt was the lifeblood of
the universe itself.  

Passing back toward Earendam, he was put up in a small village of farmers,
who were wary initially at his presence.  \#You ain\@t a mollie, are ya?\#  

\#A what?\#  Stammered Elspa.  

\#Dalith, don\@t be a damned fool, the boys got eyes, can\@t ya see?  And his
skin ain\@t all wrinkly!\#  Called out the man\@s wife.  

After some confusion, Elspa announced that no, he was not a shuddeni, and
yes, he would clean out the stable for the night\@s rest and a hearty meal.  
~
E
tome6~
Tending to the solitude of the barn, Elspa heard an odd moaning from the
loft as he worked, and at dinner, he asked Dalith what was the source of the
sound.  

Growing quiet for a moment, Dalith seemed a bit taken aback.  

\#Well, that\@s me brother Stila.  He ain\@t been right ever since the shuddeni
near took his head off on one of their raids.  One of those devils pointed
at him, and he ran screaming.  After that...\#  

Elspa looked thoughtful for a moment, and said slowly, 

\#I think I can help him.\#  

Dalith\@s head jerked up.  \#What, ye one of those devils after all!\#  

\#No - gods no, not like that.  I...  I think I can heal his mind.\#  

Looking doubtful, Dalith scratched his head.  \#That...  That water scholar
from the city that does free work was here.  He said there warn\@t nothing he
could do\# 

Elspa looked up with a grin.  

\#You might say I work on a different plane.\#  
~
E
tome7~
{WChapter Four{x

Following Dalith to the loft, Elspa saw his brother, wasted and mad.  He
seemed to lack the strength to move, but he still twitched nervously at
everything in the room.  As Elpsa approached, he began to froth at the
mouth, trying franatically to get away from him, even gathering the strength
to stand up and begin darting about the room 

Elspa looked at him, and in a moment could see the pain in the man.  The
pain - and the fear.  \#It\@s..  It\@s ok, Stila\# 

Filling the room with his inner stability, Elspa calmed the madman down.  He
no longer jerked about, but his eyes still shone with the madness.  

Putting his hand to Stila\@s head, Elspa met his gaze.  

\#Think of your soul, Stila.  Think of this as...  As a dark knot in it,
twisting everything good and right away from you.  We\@re going to undo the
spell that made that knot..  And we\@re going to give you clarity.  So..  So
you can see the light from the dark\# 

Slowly, Stila closed his eyes.  Elspa concentrated for a minute or two more,
and when Stila looked around him, tears streamed down his cheeks, and he
stood in wonder.  

\#Thank you\#, he said, in a voice that croaked.  

Elspa crept down the loft\@s ladder, leaving the two brothers to a tear
filled reunion.

E
tome8~
{WChapter Five{x

As Elspa grew closer to Earendam, he came to realize that not everything was
right in the capitol of the Republic.  Villages had been abandoned, or the
occasional field was scorched bare.  The spirits told him of barbarian
raids, attacking the fragmented and overextending holdings of the Republic. 
Most spoke of red-furred Kankorans from the other side of the Uthlin, or the
other side of the Brintors.  More alarmingly, the occasional lone shade
spoke of chaja seen amidst the wolf-men.  

Elspa was troubled by this news.  Near seven hundred years previously, the
chaja and their eyeless masters were defeated in the War of Endless Night. 
Still, the chaja and shuddeni were supposed to be gone - and there had been
Dalith\@s reference to an eyeless one.  

What was transpiring in the world?
~
E
tome9~
Elspa eventually reached Earendam the grand, and came in through the
north gate and onto Tyril Square.  Taking lodging in an inn on Cetilin Way,
he spent his time offering his services to those who needed them,earning the
gold to keep his lodging.  Traders sought him out for his ability to know
the hearts of men,and several times his services were used by the healers to
awaken those who lay in magically induced comas.  

Outside the great capitol, guardsmen brought more word of the most violent
of the kankoran tribes raiding Earendam\@s trade routes.  The decline of the
Republic which had begun with the articles of independence of Var Bandor and
Ashta Harrud several hundred years ago began to accelerate.  Fragile
alliances sprang up and fell over night, as the roads and rivers became less
safe.  The senate had warned that Earendam had overextended itself in
protecting outlying provinces, but the patrician had ordered it, citing the
titular responsibility of Earendam for its vassals.  

In the midst of this was Elspa, content, perhaps, in his meditations to let
the world slip by, doing some small part to aid the people of the city, and
yet lost to his actual role.  

As he slept each night, however, he began to have the same dream - he walked
the streets of Earendam, but its citizens had vanished.  Its towers layed
ruined, its walls breached - all in the pattern of the newly come
barbarians.  But the absence that echoed through the streets was not the
natural pattern even for such brutality - everywhere, there was a sense of
dread.  Of ...  Decay.  
~
E
tome10~
And yet there was another presence that walked the city of his dreams,
and it seemed to share his concerns over the fate of the city.  He would see
a figure walking the streets, that would vanish just as he turned a corner. 
A faint flash of light, on a corner.  At first he only felt the worry of
this other figure, but eventually it was as if he could detect words - words
reaching a crescendo each night, until he could bear it no more: \#Meet me at
south Tyril Square\# 

The next day, he awoke, picked up his things, and left the key to his room
at the inn with the innkeep.  

He went to the square, and spent the day watching the illusionists and bards
there.  Amidst the crowd, he could soothe his own feelings by immersing
himself in what the crowd felt - wonder at the illusionists from the Silver
Griffin, and hope.  In truth, he didn\@t know what he expected to find there,
and, as the sun began to set, he felt he had made a mistake.  

Truding out of the square, he nearly tripped over a ch\@taren woman, lost in
thought herself.  

Scintillating gold skin covered her spare frame, wrapped in robes of deep
gold.  Looking up at him, a light came into her eyes, and she mouthed one
word.  

\#You\#

{WChapter Six{x

Alaria and Elspa fell madly in love.  Both naturally gited with
communication with the spirits, they spent their days teaching each other
the magical tricks they\@d each learned.  Alaria taught Elspa about the
spirit stones she made her living with - crystals imbued with magical
essence, used as receptacles by mages to quickly cast their spells.  

In return, Elspa offered to share mana with her, sharing their most intimate
grasp on the structure of life itself.  

Most of all though, they learned more and more about their ability to speak
in dreams.  Almost as an extension of this power, they learned that their
souls could not only wander the dream realm - they could actually leave
their bodies!  

Wandering in the astral never-neverland and the borders of reality, they saw
the barbarian hordes, and the battles fought by the armies of the Republic. 
Scattered and defeated, they saw the fingers of Earendam\@s influence pull
back from across the Brintors, withdrawing to a few scattered villages on
the Arien.  

More troubling, they saw that the Senate and the Patrician knew of aid the
Shuddeni had been giving the barbarians, but seemed to have no inkling where
the threads had lead them.  Kor Thrandir still protected the main shuddeni
route to the surface, and the shuddeni\@s numbers were still decimated from
the war.  Known for their slow breeding and careful plotting, the world
might well see another five centuries before the shuddeni acted in force on
the surface again - or so conventional wisdom indicated.  
~
E
tome12~
Elspa, though, was troubled by Earendam\@s complacency toward the shuddeni
- secure in the knowledge that Kor Thrandir would keep the Shuddeni down in
force, and no more than scatter pockets could come to the surface through
other means.  

One night, realizing what they had to do, they both left their bodies and
descended into the bowels of the earth.  Heading to the nearby city of
Yithoul, they evaded the watchful eyestalks of the Shuddeni beasts which
could glimpse even into the astral plan, and slipped into the temple.  

There, they watched the rituals of the shuddeni, following the high priests
into their studies.  With long hours of looking at the plans, Elspa snapped
back to his body with a shock.  

\#They not going to going to attack Kor Thrandir, Alaria.  They\@re going to
Earendam!\#  
~
E

{WChapter Seven{x

The next day, Elspa left a small ruby in the sand outside Earendam.  Marking
it with a rune learned from the writings of Alaria\@s people, he linked
himself to the place, preparing for a journey.  

He and Alaria took off for Kor Thrandir, moving through the air using
borrowed wands from their friends the illusionists.  Moving into the
Brintors, taking less than two days to reach Kor Thrandir.  

The Lord Protector was skeptical of their claims.  

\#Shuddeni?  Attack Earendam?  They\@ll have to get through me, first!\#  

\#Lord Valis, they aren\@t going to go through the surface - they don\@t have
the military might to go through the seal.  They\@ve built..  Some...  Some
sort of nexus, and they\@re going to use it to join their barbarian allies on
the surface - when they attack Earendam in two days time!\#  

Valis looked at him skeptically.  

\#Even if this were true, what would you have me do?\#  

Elspa looked straight into Valis\@ eyes.  \#Bring your army to Earendam, sir. 
Or the city will fall in three days time.\#  
~
E
tome14~
\#Protecting this keep is my sacred duty.  Twenty generations have guarded
it without fail.  I have sworn that no shuddeni will pass.\#  

\#My lord, can\@t you see?  Why not let the water scholars scry?  Let me teach
astral travel to one of your spirit mages...\#  

\#We have been unable to scry the Shuddeni for the past six months.  \#

\#What do you mean, unable to scry?\#  

\#Some new sorcery, perhaps.  An ill configuration of the stars, says Loril. 
I\@m sorry, Elspa, but without more evidence....\#  

Elspa pounded his fist on the table.  

\#Are you blind?  The shuddeni are helping the barbarians!  If you sit and do
nothing, the Republic will fall!\#  

Valis looked at Elspa and the shockingly beautiful Ch\@taren women beside
him.  The Ch\@taren were their staunchiest allies, and if this one found this
man compelling...  

\#I cannot bring the army, Elspa.  But...  The men who are not on watch the
next day or so.  Ask among them.  Those who wish to volunteer can go.  I
know the barbarians will reach Earendam in a day or two\@s time.  That much,
at least, I owe the Republic.\#

E
tome15~
{WChapter Eight{x

At dawn the next day, Elspa, Alaria, and one hundred Kor Thrandian
men-at-arms marched out of the gates.  

The sergeant looked at his men, and said.  

\#Well, it\@s going to be a hard march past enemy lines.  But if we force
march, we should be there before the..\#  

\#No need!\#  Said Elspa with a grin.  

\#Gather around in a circle, captain.\#  

Used to the ways of mages, the sergeant obeyed without questioning exactly
what would happen, perhaps expecting the wind to sweep them to Earendam, or
to travel through a puddle.  What he saw he was completely unprepared for. 


With a \#whoosh!\#  Of imploding air, they popped out of existence by Kor
Thrandir and outside the north gate of Earendam.  

Staggered, the soldiers looked about in disbelief.  

Now it was Alaria\@s turn to grin.  \#And they said the wheel was a good
idea....\#  
~
E
tome16~
Marching into Earendam, whose northern half was now filled with the
remnants of the Republic\@s troops that had made their way back to the city,
Elspa realized the depths of their predicament.  The city looked as if it
might survive the barbarians, but a full scale shuddeni war party?  

That night, atop the walls of the city, Elspa and Alaria were wed. 
Exchanging vows, they knitted their life forces together, using the magic
that had served them so well for this last affirmation of love.  

\#If our plan is to work, Alaria...  We can\@t rely on the masses of military
light.  Everything we do - everything has to matter.  Everything has to be
done right.\#

{WChapter Nine{x

Dawn broke over Earendam with a warcry.  

The red kankorans were lead by Rjaal Kalas, a sinister wolf-man who had
fought his way to the top of his people by every conceivably atrocity. 
Uniting a series of already bloodthirsty Kankoran tribes, Rjaal became
Thane, and lead his people across the Uthlin to bring a bloodshed not seen
in this part of the world for quite some time.  

Now, at the height of his power, Rjaal had brought his horde to the very
gates of Earendam.  A sea of red fur, axes, maces and spears, the horde
approached the north wall in a rush, heedless of loss of life or limb.  

Archers let loose with a sea of arrows, but the tide of bodies kept coming
remorselessly at the wall.  

Heaving an enormous battering ram, the Kankorans begin hammering away at
Earendam\@s gates, trying to batter their way into the great city.  
~
E
tome18~
On the east wall, Elspa, Alaria, and the archers were making a daring
effort.  

Clambering down the wall like many of the other sortie parties, they struck
for the east flank of the army.  

There, hidden under a cloak of invisibility, were the scattered shuddeni
remnants which had supplied the kankorans with enchanted weapons and
protective spells.  

Now, the shuddeni were hurriedly constructing a strange artifact, surrounded
by the east flank of the horde.  

Touching their hands to the heads of the men from Kor Thrandir, Elspa and
Alaria fed every hope, every dream they could muster into driving them to a
zealous frenzy.  

For their part, the men of Kor Thrandir were if anything bred in their
opposition to the shuddeni, and were more than eager to put paid to their
hereditary enemies.  
~
E
tome19~
Alaria raised a shield to protect against the magics of void about them,
and they charged swiftly into combat.  Letting slip with bolts of pure
energy, they tore into the souls of the shuddeni they faced, blasting them
back toward their eldritch device.  Although unsuspecting of the attack, the
shuddeni and kankorans reformed their lines, hacking viciously at the
men-at-arms they drew close to them.  

Elspa and Alaria cut through the lines, dropping visions of damnation onto
the wolf-men, and subduing the battle-crazed berserkers.  With luck and the
skill of their companions, they and some ten of the Kor Thrandians broke
through the lines and approached the device.  

Running low on mana, Elspa found himself drawing power from a source
unsuspected - his father\@s signet ring!  For so long had he kept it near
him, it now served as a focus for his power, allowing him to draw more than
he though possibly into his spells.  
~
E
tome20~
Blocking his mind from the fear spells of the shuddeni with a mental
shell, he blocked one void scholar from his spellcasting, and tainted the
flow of magic to another with sharp stabs of light.  

Alaria, however, had no such focus - instead, she drew on her dwindling
supply of spirit stones.  

One of the shuddeni raised his arms, calling forth a giant elemental out of
the ground.  Alaria turned to spiritwrack it, but the spell fizzled on the
great thing, which was busy pounding away at the Kor Thrandians.  

Elspa shouted to her \#Alaria!  It doesn\@t have a soul!\#  

Nodding, Alaria drew deep within herself - rather than striking at the soul
of her opponent, she drew her own life force into a bolt of pure energy, and
blasted away at the golem.  
~
E
tome21~
Supported by no less than four shuddeni scholars, the massive scholar
took bolt after bolt.  Finally, with Alaria gasping for breath, the
elemental crumbled into dust.  

Elspa leaned to signal affirmation to her, but his smile collapsed into a
tortured yell as he saw the shuddeni swordmaster come behind her.  Striking
with at her chest with a cruel blow, she fell to the ground, golden body
slashed and battered.  

Elspa raced to the body, but found himself surrounded by shuddeni.  Hoping
only to join his beloved, he raised his staff defensively, mind nearly
exhausted.  

The shuddeni closed in, sensing weakness.  

What they found, though, was beyond their wildest expectations.  Rising from
the body of Alaria was a golden seraph, wings of light with a sword of
flame, striking at them with wild abandon.  

Elspa could not watch as the seraph destroyed the shuddeni - he could only
hold Alaria\@s body and see the scene of her death reflected over and over
again.  
~
E
tome22~
While his love\@s killers had been slain, the seraph had vanished after
its task of vengenace was complete.  

The remaining shuddeni had rallied to the device, which was now pulsing with
a deep black light.  Mad with grief, he looked at Alaria one last time. 
With disbelief, he saw her last spirit stone had returned to his hand - one
last, affinity, perhaps for what had been hers.  

Crumbling the stones, he channeled the mana - and what he did with it was
something never done before.  

He drew the energy into him, and instead of discharging it as a bolt, he
became the energy.  The avatar of all the magics of spirit, his body was no
longer even flesh - a pale wash wash of blue energy, he ground his way
through the enemies\@ - holy power severing everything evil, ripping shuddeni
limbs from bodies - tossing Kankorans like rag dolls, and only when the
infernal device was gone did the spell\@s magic end, and he collapsed,
gasping for air, to the ground.

In the darkest days of the War of Fire 
The water magics were born 
One of the first who wielded the life 
Was Arafia, the Ctanes 
His diamond heart he gave in whole 
To Istera the Fair 
Bliss they knew and love most true 
But such is never safe. 
Evil watched them hatefully; 
And tore their hearts apart. 
Ctanes himself exposed to hurt 
By giving his heart to Istera 
Bound in the nether pits. 
Arafia sought aid afar 
But no help did he gain 
Few indeed the pits can find 
Or enter would therein. 
Ctanes\@s love would not let him rest 
So sought he high and low 
Until at last his calls were heard 
By Vaialos the pure. 
Vaialos pity took upon 
The templar tall and brave 
The arm of Vaialos he stretched 
And reached across the planes. 
He took to him a mortal form 
And aid broght to Ctanes 
He took him to the edge of death 
But could not enter in. 
\#Arafia,\# the avatar spoke 
\#Henceforth hie thee alone. 
\#But do not fear; I give thee here 
\#A charmed dove to bear within.\# 
The platinum dove was bound with spells 
Of armor for the mind 
Its bearer would if all went well 
Retain his will and soul. 
Arafia thanked the avatar 
And steeled himself as best he could 
Though battles myriad he\@d fought 
The pits were not for mortals made. 
Arafia he entered in 
And what he did inside 
Has been revealed to no one 
Who can say what there betide 
But this is known: emerge he did 
With Istera by his side. 
The mortal with the diamond heart 
Had triumphed over all the worst 
That evil set against him. 
And in the end he wedded her 
Thus proving for all time 
That courage, love, and purity 
The ultimate victory will have 
Though all the world and all below 
Should stand to block its way. 
The power of love is greater than that 
Which all the void can bring to bear. 
To do that thought impossible 
Requires only will.

He was tired of young Darien ruining his things, so he decided to put him
 to work sorting books instead.
  
[The aelin has a gentler expression on his face as he points out a huge 
stack of books to a visibly confused Darien.]

Darien, being not -quite- as dull as the average alatharyan, got the 
hang of his new job and even got to like it!
  
[Darien is shown smiling happily atop a ladder with an enormous pile of
 books in his hand.]

He got to like it SO much that he would even read the books when he 
wasn\@t working!

One day, he met the trickster god, Tzajai the Incomprehensible.
  
[A cackling nefortu is shown in front of a visibly shocked Darien.]
~

Tzajai told Darien that he would be allowed to make one wish. Darien
wished for his very own library, with books he could read all he wanted!
  
[Darien is gesturing towards Tzajai, with visions of a grand room full 
of bookshelves around his head.]

Tzajai, being a mischievous sort, gave Darien exactly what he\@d asked for.
  
[Here, an unhappy Darien is crammed into a broom closet that would have
 been small for a human, surrounded by books in shelves.]

But, since he was surrounded by books, Darien soon forgot all his

This tome is quite decrepit.  The faded leather cover might have once
been blue.  A metal device in the cover is so worn that any features it may
have had are totally indistinguishable; it now appears as a worn oval.  The
brittle, crumbling pages are in a variety of languages, many unreadable or
indecipherable.  Two pages stand out: 

LAEDRINU, OF THE FALLEN THALOXAE:
  
Josia of the house of Thaloxae did a stone-gray mandate decree:
One in Four of newblood wings would be cast aside, but not
By the cold-iron caress of bladesong melody.
  
Simply removed, for her starving ranks had now long fought
Poverty, and his cousin, Starvation, as the spotted influence,
Of the Thaloxae did dwindle with time, did weaken and rot.
  
Oh, what spotless marble walls did your fortress shine of in decadence,
Thaloxia of Commerce and Stone! What wing\@d minds did craft
Spell and stonecraft of unsurpassed brilliance.
  
But that was another time and age, before the haft
Of Time\@s unseen blade (final and grotesque!) was brought against You
And death\@s wind took your halls in icy draft.
  
Your trade-gold did dwindle, Thaloxia of Old: fate\@s sphere spun anew.
And the furrowed brows of the desperates (murderous and militant)
Set upon the High-dwellers in brutal, crimson coup.
  
And were you Brave, armored Josia, stoic, reticent?
When all power fell into your tooth\@d lap, and the dreams of Aged Thaloxia crushed:
Was to rule alone your true intent?
~
E
tome2~
But seized you power over who and what the day that kith-blood gushed
Crimson-pure over the immortal pillars, spotted, cracked
And the tongues of the heaven-dwellers themselves were hushed?
  
Thaloxia (now nameless! Now yours!) starves still, sacked
By the armies of misfortune and bretrayal\@s civil blade.
Her people\@s bodies--in youth and age--by hunger wracked.
  
And in such an age, harsh and cold, was young Laedrinu made.
Four in One. Removed, that others may be spared,
That they may, with little, return to the ancient trade.
  
With features of chiseled jade, and golden-haired
Kithless Laedrinu, spirit bright, made a bed of dust and earth
Without a single soul about these realms concerned of how he fared.
  
A tragedy, perhaps, Laedrinu\@s brith!
Child forgotten, demolished Fourth
Whose people cruel denied him worth.
  
So sunk the child of the spotted wings into the arms of the dust of the North,
And did hunger and shiver still, but did not cease his breath,
As the Spirit of the Land did pity this wracked and youthful soul 
    (of heartless, enforced exodus) and did strength and warmth to the child bring forth.

The grimoire\@s pages have been burned or heated in such a way as to leave
them fused into a single lump of charred parchment.  However, the very first
page, the top of blackened mass, is written upon in an angular, antique
script, with an illustration below.  Both script and illustration are
written in a glowing, flame-red ink which flickers, candle-like, and almost
seems to rise up from the blackened parchment.  The script reads:

{ROut of Chaos, there arose void, and within the void there were Three.  

The First perceived the Chaos around him, and did not think it good.  \#Let
the void bring forth Form,\# spake the First, and lo, it was so, and the
First looked upon Form, and was satisfied.  

The Second perceived the Form the First had caused to be engendered, and
thought it not enough.  \#Let Form be given Purpose, and so thrive\# spake the
Second, and lo, it was so, and the Second looked upon Life, and cherished
it.  

The Third spake not, for It sought again the perfection of the ungoverned
Chaos, and so {rrekindled it in Form and Purpose{R, that all things would
seek again to return to it.  {x

The bottom half of the page is an illustration of darkly suggestive shapes,
done in smoldering reds and ashen black.  Only with prolonged study do two
shapes begin to become clear in its depths, pushing aside and corraling the
leaping towers of blood and smoke.  

In the darkness behind them, the shadow of a third shape can perhaps be
seen, vast and brooding like a titanic dragon.

Alas that such wisdom has been lost to us through the ages, leaving us to
suffer at the hands of the active!  If only the heroes of our modern age
would take up the cause of inaction, and bearing its standard rally forth,

Upon reaching a certain age one finds great contentment in simply being. 
Let others till the fields and fight the battles; for those of us who have

In all our histories, legends, and songs, tales are spun of the great
deeds of heroes.  Their mighty adventures are recounted with fervor, and
many a young child has dreamed of someday emulating these feats.  But the
reflective soul might ask of himself, \#Why?\#  -- and not without cause.  

For indeed, after toiling through such tribulation and emerging triumphant,
has the legendary hero left the lands any better for us all?  Disease and
starvation still take their toll, theft and manipulation run rampant, and
worse yet, grammatical errors are everpresent.  What are all these efforts
for, if not to eradicate such blights?

THE FLAME DRAGON

The flame dragon dwells deep within the bowels of the earth, enshrined in
a tomb of basalt and lava below the temple of Yithoul.  Simply reaching
its lair is a feat unto itself, having to avoid the devouring scythe
beetle and pass unseen through the smoke-filled caverns of the fire
elementals.  The first may be accomplished by quick feet - the second will
likely require some way to become unseen (there is a skeleton in the
Savannah with a vial that will suffice, as will the staves of invisibility
from the Bandor staff-maker).  Once unseen, head east until the last
southward branch.  Take that branch to the second westward tunnel, after
which a quick turn west and south will lead to the lake of fire.

The dragon is far too fast and powerful to maintain a single person in the
fore.  While its strength matches the amber, its speed far surpasses it,
allowing it to lash its fiery claws multiple times in quick succession
against all of its assailants.  In addition, it will often play fire over
all of its opponents, burning flesh, parchment, food, and potions.
Understandably, its completely immune to the effects of fire and
vulnerable to weapons of ice.

While the dragon will fly out when the sacrificial chains are approached,
the optimal place to engage it is within its own lair, as that will allow
fleeing onto solid land, rather than burning lava.  A short, scalding
flight over the lava leads to a small ledge in the southeast corner of the
cavern.  This ledge makes for a good rest spot, as the dragon itself is
far too large to force its way out onto it.  Caloric potions from Septivar
in Earendam are a must for any who cannot protect themselves against the
dragon\@s flame.

When slain, the dragon\@s scales may be fashioned into a breastplate and
helmet, each offering an improvement to combat blows and protection from
fire.  Its lair contains a hoard of gold, the burnt skeleton of an unlucky
adventurer, and a precious ruby (intended for those who study the Golden
Flames: see the Summoning of the Salamander).
~

parchment13~
==== HERE THERE BE DRAGONS ====

THE AMBER DRAGON

Lore has it that the amber dragon once saved the Kohlis from some unnamed
destruction - in turn, not only did the Kohlis settle their city near the
dragon, they worship it as their savior to this day.  To locate the amber,
cut through Nendor to the network of tunnels at the base of Mt. Enrien.
From there, head west and south to reach the dragon\@s den.

The amber dragon\@s battle-scarred scales have grown thick with age,
rendering it completely immune to conventional weapons.  While
magic-imbued weapons may reach past its scales, they will find their blows
softened by the white aura that the dragon innately projects.  While age
has taken its toll, preventing the amber from lashing out its claws in
quick succession, its strikes are easily sweeping enough to claw through
multiple opponents at once.  In addition, it uses its bulk to great
effect, laying out its opponents with sharp bashing blows.

Most dangerous, however, is the dragon\@s lightning breath - it is able to
play entire fields of lightning over its opponents.  The strong electrical
currents are often enough to both lock up muscles, causing temporary
paralysis, and to completely fuse together any pieces of worn jewelry.  Of
course, do not discount the sheer amount of harm inflicted by the
unearthly voltages - two such blasts are easily able to kill even the
hardiest of heroes.

Great difficulty is met with commensurate reward, of course.  The dragon\@s
scales can be molded into an almost-complete suit, forming helm, vest,
sleeves, and leggings.  Excellent for templars, as the scales strengthen
the mind and help overall combat ability.  Behind the wall lies a pile of
gold and a lance and shield made of the same.  The real treasure, however,
consists of the crown, amulet, and ring of the Dragon - the adventurer who
wishes to appropriate these three will need the key held by the Kohli high
priest and the two keys held by Kzroth, the demon lord, respectively.

THE PHOENIX

A thick jumble of interwined and heaped bone form a blackened eyrie on the
peaks of one of the Mlejian mountains.  A solitary phoenix feather (in
itself a powerful wand whose invocation will summon raging firestorms)
sits in the eyrie - stealing this feather will bring forth the phoenix
in all its brilliant plumage and fiery rage.

The phoenix greets thieves with a stabbing beak and flaming talons, 
alternating the two as it seeks to recover its feather.  Considering its
nature, it is understandably both resistant to flame and vulnerable to
ice.  In addition, it will occasionally call up raging firestorms (in much
the same way as its feather) to incinerate any who stand in its general
vicinity.

The trick to fighting the phoenix is to understand it dispersions.  It
will often disperse away from combat, injuring any who are nearby.  Should
its opponents leave the locale before it recollects itself, it will lose
interest and fail to return.  However, those who wait will, eventually,
see the phoenix reappear in a burst of flame to continue combat.

When \#slain,\# the phoenix will disintegrate into a small pile of
smoldering ashes.  Tasting the ashes is not recommended for any who do not
study the Golden Flames - even a small taste will consume the taster in a
burning wreath of fire for the next half-day.  Finally, should the ashes
be left untouched for a few hours, the holder will be able to bear witness
to the phoenix\@s inexorable rebirth.

==== BEASTS OF THE AIR ====

THE ANCIENT GRIFFIN

The ancient griffin\@s age-weathered grey feathers, combined with its
above-normal size, lend it an air of nobility.  It makes its home in the
clouds above the Aerie, requiring all aspiring adventurers to locate a
source of flight should they wish to test their mettle against its
battle-scarred body.

In battle, it often attempts to strike twice in quick succession - its
claws and beak, however, seem to have trouble consistently piercing armor.
One blow will be glancing at best, barely grazing its prey.  The next,
however, finding a chink or a gap, can strike with incredibly deadly
force.  This high variance in threat adds a level of uncertainty to its
fighting that is not often seen in others.

Outside of beak and claw, the griffin is able to dive towards its prey
with incredible speed, tumbling its opponent through the air (or into the
ground, as the case may be).  However, the griffin is large enough that
a sharp blow of its wings can also accomplish the same effect.  Finally,
it demonstrates some moderate control of the magic of Air, gathering it
together to bind its opponents limbs and hamper movement.

The victorious adventurer may wish to remove one of the griffin\@s claws
from its body.  Not quite a sword, not quite a dagger, the claw is still
deadly sharp and makes for a formidable weapon.

THE GREAT BLUE WORM

In the aftermath of Kzroth\@s escape and re-imprisonment, a new series of
chasms and tunnels were revealed below Mt. Enrien.  An icy, underground
lake, replete with its own, unique ecosystem became accessible through
this newly-revealed network.  While the inhospitable environment assures
that any surviving creatures are likely to be at the apex of their
evolution, none of them are as deadly or resilient as the great blue worm.

The worm\@s sharp teeth are able to shred through armor and flesh,
generally biting one-for-one in response to a scholar\@s staff.  While
dangerous, however, the worm\@s needle-filled maw is not its primary source
of protection.  Instead, its writhing bulk is coated in fluorescing
electric energy - it may be thought of as one of Lidreau\@s electric eels
writ large.  These currents often strike out from the worm, arcing between
all adventurers present before grounding out.  While the worm is
completely immune to the effects of its own lightning, it seems to have
some moderate vulnerable to divine weapons (perhaps due to its long tenure
in the bowels of the earth).

In addition to the danger presented by its natural defenses, any
adventurers who wish to try their might against the worm must also
navigate the lake\@s ice fields.  The cold, sharp ice snags at clothing and
armor, preventing rapid movement through the water.  In addition, chunks
of ice may occasionally break off, crushing any limbs unfortunate enough
to be caught underneath.

Much like the high kkhilgh, the worm\@s beak may be removed and wielded as
a weapon.  Also like the high kkhilgh, its bite will retain its
electrified nature, even after death.  In addition, its hide and skull may
be removed and worn as tunic or helmet, respectively, primarily providing
the wearer with some moderate protection against spells and extreme
protection against lightning.

THE JIAST\@JA

The Jiast\@ja is a gigantic fish that dwells below the surface of Jasa
Lake.  For those who wish to approach the apex predator of Jasa, chewing
on a few of the mussels that grow above the lake will provide some
short-term means of breathing underwater.  A carapace of dinner-plate
sized brown scales lead into a jagged, teeth-lined maw.  At the other
end, its streamlined body merges into a single, overdeveloped propeller.

As with every creature, the Jiast\@ja has its own, well-defined, rhythm in
combat - it is able to snap off two vicious bites before its thick
propelling fin takes it too far past its target.  While its thick armor
fails to provide any extraordinary protection, electrified weapons will
greatly accelerate its demise.

Do not be caught off-guard and heavily injured, though, as a the fish is
able to propel itself forward in a quick, bashing rush.  As tested, there
does not seem to be any consistent way to protect oneself against its
bulk.

Once slain, the fish\@s scales may be removed to form a breastplate and
helmet - the toughness of the scales will help protect the vitality of the
wearer.  In addition, one of its many, razor-sharp teeth may be removed
and wielded in much the same fashion as a dagger.

THE GREAT STEAM LIZARD

The great steam lizard, like many of the other entries in this bestiary,
is, by far, the largest of her kind.  Her cobalt skin somewhat blends into
the low-light water where she resides, deep in the hot springs of
southeast Ryarl.  She may only be accessed via single file through a long,
thin fissure under these hot springs - take care when fleeing from the
lizard, as this fissure not only acts a bottleneck, but also periodically
emits thin flutes of scalding water.
  
While the lizard is highly resistant to physical weapons (and fire, of
course, due to both being submerged and its affinity for heat), her
physiology offers no protection against electricity and some moderate
vulnerability to cold.  She is able to bite twice in quick succession,
chomping down on her prey with brutal force.  However, despite the water
being her natural habitat, she is not well-versed in underwater combat -
she simply flails ineffectually when attempting to trip up her prey with
her tail.

Finally, beware when she opens her jaws.  She possesses an innate ability
to project a stream of scaling steam (though whether the steam is produced
internally or if she simply superheats the water is unknown) at whomever
she is facing.  While not incredibly deadly in isolation, she is able to
generate such streams at a fairly high rate, allowing her to quickly wear
down even the toughest opponents.

Once defeated, the lizard\@s tail\@s flexible, yet tough, composition makes
for an excellent whip (it will also help the wielder resist both fire and
drowning, as well offering excellent mobility and accuracy).  Her hide may
be removed and used as a strong, yet uninteresting shield (although the
hide\@s innate resistance to fire may be beneficial to kankorans).  Her
skull, when worn as a helmet, offers the same resistances as the tail and
should offer some additional advantages in combat.  In addition, carefully
examining the skull may yield some insights into certain rites (see other
works on the Bloodpyre, specifically the Summoning of the Salamander, for
details).

THE BASILISK

The basilisk may be found in the southern wastes, its lair hidden a little
ways south of a turn in the road to Harrud.  To find the lair, follow the
rutted path until reaching a turn where the path runs north and east - a
giant spire of rock will lay to the northeast.  From here, slowly venture
south into the dry plains towards the pile of stony rubble that serves as
an entrance to the basilisk\@s den.

Being a creature of the desert, the basilisk is, understandably, both
resistant to heat and vulnerable to frost.  Bringing along a scholar or
templar of water is highly recommended.  In their absence, however, merely
bringing a weapon of frost or ice will likely be sufficient for the
patient adventurer.  The basilisk moves slowly in battle, barely able to
trade blows one-for-one with a typical scholar.  In physical strength, it
is comparable to a substandard dragon, slotting somewhere between the
emerald and the amber in terms of both strength and resiliency.  In
addition, the basilisk\@s lair is too cluttered for it to follow up its
bites with rushing shoulders or a flailing tail.

It is the innate magical properties of the basilisk\@s eye, and to a lesser
extent, its breath, that present the real danger.  It is able to belch out
waves of corrosive gas - deadly yet infrequent.  In addition, its eye may
innately call upon the maledictions of the sphere of Earth, both partially
petrifying and increasing the density of whomever its gaze falls upon.
Most dangerous, however, is when its gaze lands long enough to fully
petrify its target.  The unlucky adventurer is turned to stone for two
full hours, during which the basilisk may feed at its leisure.  Nibbling
off flesh-turned-granite both heals the basilisk and reduces the overall
vitality of the opponent - the basilisk is easily able to reduce the
typical hero by a fifth before stone reverts to flesh.

The basilisk\@s scales may be fashioned into a cuirass, its teeth into a
dagger, and its eye into an artifact.  The scales, when worn, improve
resistance to petrification, vitality, and the wearer\@s ability to deal
physical blows.  The tooth produces a top-tier dagger and extrudes a
poison upon contact - interestingly enough, this property is not observed
when the tooth is attached to a living basilisk.  While, like the cuirass,
the eye improves resistance to magical petrification and vitality, it will
also periodically petrify the bearer\@s opponents.

THE SEVEN-HEADED WORM

This unique seven-headed worm lies deep in the forest of Morn.  Its lair
lies in a small clearing, accessible only through a shallow dell in the
southeast corner of one of Morn\@s towering forests.  It lies at the bottom
of a deep shaft, its translucent length coiled tightly around the base.

While all seven mouths are lined with rows of razor-sharp teeth, due to
possible space or coordination constraints, only two can ever bite at any
given time.  All of the tiny worms about the lair will also attack, of
course, though they are easily ignored and even more easily cleared out.

While the worm\@s translucent hide is highly resistant to conventional
weaponry, both fire and ice have been confirmed to strike the worm with
full force, so choosing a weapon formed of either is highly recommended.

While fighting the worm itself is fairly uninteresting, the aftermath is
anything but.  A pair of wormskin boots may be crafted from its hide,
granting the wearer the ability to conjure a purple fog to reveal any who
hide in the vicinity.  In addition, the worm\@s stomach contains the key to
the treasure chest in the witch\@s cave - this chest contains a couple
powerful daggers, an interesting little pouch of brimstone (see other
works on the Bloodpyre for details), and a pair of magical boots made for
long walkers.

==== BEASTS OF THE EARTH ====

THE HIGH KKHILGH

The high kkhilgh is the uncontested leader of its hive - its decisions are
final, its purpose is the hive\@s purpose.  Twelve feet of chitinous armor,
snapping jaws, and natural lightning protect bulge upon bulge of
developing eggs.  The bug may be found in the back, northeast corner of
the kkhilgh colony, accessible from the west after exiting the phase
spider\@s maze.  A staff or mace is recommended for adventurers who have
not yet finished their guild training - a blunt instrument is the easiest
way to dispatch the kkhilgh warriors that will assault such.

The high kkhilgh\@s natural affinity for lightning renders him immune to
the element, of course.  While simple weapons work best (or at least,
sufficiently), short daggers are not recommended - the high kkhilgh\@s
carapace is thick enough to provide protection in much the same way as a
templar\@s shield, easily turning aside such small blades.  Balancing that,
the high kkhilgh is also too bulky and slow for its electrified jaws to
strike multiple times in succession.  Do not, however, mistake the high
kkhilgh for some simple bug - it will also attempt to both smash its
assailants to the ground and to claw away sword and staff.

The biggest danger, however, lie in its innate electrical currents.  When
enough static builds up, the high kkhilgh is able to unleash up to three
distinct lightning strikes against its target.  On the other hand, one of
the biggest obstacles to its defeat is the healing provided by some sort
of clear secretion - even a small amount of this rejuvenating fluid is
able to counteract a dozen solid blows of the staff.

When finally defeated, a few crucial pieces of chitin may be pulled off
and fitted as usable armor - a small piece of its forelimbs may be
stripped and used as a shield and a passable breastplate may be hammered
out of the piece of chitin covering the same.  The most interesting
trophy, however, is its electrified jaws.  Whatever property charged the
bug\@s bites in life is maintained after its death, allowing the severed
jaws to strike with the same elemental force.

THE ALBINO ALLIGATOR

This pale-skinned behemoth can be found floating about the murky surface
of one of Sythtys\@s lakes (this specific lake lies between the wet swamps
and the srryn village).  It is surprisingly large and well-adjusted for a
genetic throwback, perhaps due to the camouflage its grey-white skin
provides against the surface of its particular lake, and is always waiting
for new prey to set foot inside its domain of influence.

Its unlucky target need not actually stumble across the alligator - in
fact, the alligator will aggressively seek out food sources, erupting
from the depths of the lake to charge at any who linger too long in its
pond.  Combat is dictated, and dominated, by the beast\@s brute strength -
its flashing jaws chomp down on limb and torso with both the furious
strength and ferocious speed of a barbarian\@s axe.  Mundane weapons will
find their return blows diminished against the alligator\@s thick hide.
Otherwise, the alligator shares many of the same properties as the srryn
that inhabit the swamps - a wise adventurer will shelve fire in favor of
frost.

The alligator\@s tendency to snap away weapons dramatically amplifies the
danger it poses, as a defenseless hero is quickly torn asunder by its
fearsome bites.  In addition, it is recommended to be well-rested before
striking the final blows, as the alligator\@s final, crushing chomp may
turn victory from sweet to pyrrhic.

Once dead, the ribcage, skull, and hide may be removed and worn as
effective, if gruesome, armor.  The stout bones of the ribcage and the
thick folds of the hide provide protection against blunt blows and mundane
weapons, respectively (although their sheer weight will likely impede the
movement of any who wear them).  The skull, on the other hand, will help
support the wearer\@s vitality and offer some combative advantages with no
distinguishable drawbacks.
~
E
parchment3~
THE ANCIENT SRORSIAN

As is the case with many species, the ancient srorsian is a mammoth
version of what is now a rather normal-sized lizard.  It splits its time
between two locales - resting in its cave while surrounded by the srryn of
the Mlejian mountains, or grazing in the wastes under the watchful eye of the
Kzaya-Ha nefortu.  Its massive bulk is surrounded by four equally massive
legs (take note - this will be important later) and its razor-sharp teeth
belie its docile, omnivorous lifestyle.

In combat, this is an instance where more is not necessarily better, as
its massive bulk is more than capable of crushing all of its assailants at
once.  While it is able to occasionally gather up the dexterity to lash
out with its trunk-like legs, being stricken by one of its kicks is not
nearly as dangerous as getting bashed to the ground by its shoulder.
Finally, as with the albino alligator, its cold blooded nature and thick
hide provide it with a vulnerability to the cold as well as resistances
towards both heat and most weapons.

It would be a simple and predictable fight, were it not for the ancient
srorsian\@s effective use of its heavy weight.  When enraged, it may rear
up on its hind legs - if the battle is not soon ended, it will bring them
down with a crash, trampling its opponents beneath its feet.  In addition,
it will occasionally stun its opponents by using its shoulder to crush
them against the wall.

The srorsian\@s hide makes an effective, if heavy, tunic. When worn, its
thick, reptilian hide will make the wearer more hale and more resistant to
both sword and staff.  The heavy weight, however, is unsuited for both
scholars and those who require unrestricted movement.

=== BEASTS OF THE SURFACE ====

THE GIANT MICA CRAB

The giant mica crab is the largest of its kind.  While most of its
scattered young are no larger than the standard crustacean, this giant
could easily fit a full-grown alatharyan inside of its shell and a human
male in each of its massive claws.  The crab\@s shell is studded with thin
shards of mica, each shard casting its own scintillating glow over the
black chitin.  The crab may be found in the northern reaches of the Ryarl,
near the mouth of the Hyloth.  Watch out for the rapids that churn near
the mouth - an unsuspecting adventurer in a canoe can meet a quick death,
smashed against the rocks of the rapids.

While the crab\@s chitin makes for interesting properties when worn as
armor, acquiring it can be somewhat tricky.  While the shells of lesser
crabs may be susceptible to cracking under blunt trauma, the giant mica
crab\@s shell is sturdy enough to shrug off similar blows in their entirety
and is tough enough to turn the blades of most swords, substantially
reducing their effectiveness.  Care must be exercised when selecting a
weapon to bear against the crab.  Blows empowered by the elements bypass
the shell\@s protections to strike fully against the crab - however, it is
prudent to select a weapon which cannot be stripped from the hand, as a
dextrous twist of its claw followed by a series of bashing blows can
quickly result in an unfavorable conclusion.  Despite its ability to use
the backs and sides of its claws for blunt, crushing blows, the crab
mostly strikes with a clawing motion, similar to an unarmed kankoran.  Do
not presume that its size renders it slow - its flashing claws can strike
as quickly and as often as a fighter\@s spear.  In between strikes, any one
of the crab\@s legs may kick out for a quick, though less powerful, blow.

To protect against its bashing blows, purchase hellebore trimmings from
Old Althea in the forest of Morn.  Caution must still be exercised,
however, as the protection imparted does little should the crab choose to
strike a stunning blow with both claws.  In addition, limb-crushing blows
from the crab easily bypass the hellebore\@s magic while hampering both
quick movement and offhand dexterity.

Once slain, however, its shell may be molded to be worn on the head, feet,
arms, legs, torso, or as a shield.  All resulting armor will be formed of
nonflammable chitin and offer excellent protection at the cost of heavy
weight.  In general, while mica will both make the wearer stronger and
more hale, its heavy weight will hamper dextrous movement.

Finally, members of Idris may be called upon to fight.  It is
the responsibility of every Knight to be willing and able to do
this.  And, indeed, those of Idris should go into battle before
those of Mett are required to do so, for it is imperative that
Knights of Mett maintain their secrecy, lest their future
usefulness to the cause of Balance be reduced.  If it is necessary
for those of Idris to battle, all efforts should be made to secure
documents away safely prior to the fight.  Otherwise, much work may
be lost, or perhaps even captured and capitalized upon.  Clearly,
this is not a desirable outcome.

It is an honor to be a Knight of Enaerai.  To be among those
chosen to uphold the Balance that is so essential to these lands.
May Enaerai bless us all, and may her Eye ever gaze upon us with
favor.
~
E
wide5~
***The Responsibility of the Knights of Idris***

Alas, despite the clear need for Balance, so many refuse to
accept it.  In most cases, this is not an active opposition to the
idea, rather, most prevalent is an apathy or lack of exposure to
it.  Therefore, the Knights of Enaerai seek to correct this.  There
are many differing methods for this, among them, simple teaching
and spreading of the ideas, to convince others of the need.
Failing this, some may be convinced to act as needed for the
Balance by making it not worth their while to refuse.  And
sometimes, though this need not be a last resort, direct violence
is required.  However the case may be, the overarching goal and
function of every Knight is to work towards maintaining the
balance.

The role the Idris branch plays in this is threefold.  Firstly,
it is the responsibility and function of Idris to consider,
develop, and spread the concept of Balance in all of its
manifestations.  This is done, of course, according to the
teachings of the Great Lady Enaerai, whom every Knight pledges to
serve at their induction.  Secondly, Knights of Idris should keep
information on adventurers, insofar as it pertains to their outlook
on life.  Ideally, this information is largely supplied by the Mett
branch.  The purpose of this is to provide an outlet for correcting
the balance when the Scales of Orlin lean overmuch.  The more that
is known, the more readily action may be taken.

This section continues on to the final page.
~
E
wide4~
There are those who, possessed of a more altruistic outlook,
cannot conceive of the need for Balance because it permits, even 
requires, darkness and evil.  This idea is intrinsically flawed.
Consider a world where there was no such thing as \@poor\@.  Every
inhabitant of this world must have the same number and quality of
possession as every other.  If this were not true, there would be
some sort of difference of degree in wealth, and whichever had less
would be deemed \@poor\@, even if they were by our standards 
fabulously wealthy.  This is true because titles like \@rich\@ and 
\@poor\@ are utterly relative to one another.  Yet, even if the case
where each denizen had the exact same as every other were true, 
none of them could be called \@rich\@  Not poor, but not rich either.
In the same way, \@good\@ and \@evil\@ are relative descriptors.  If 
there was no darkness, no evil, in the lands, then there could be 
no good, nor any light.  And how can someone who claims to seek
good actively choose a world in which there was no good or light?
And so their argument fails.

With just what has so far been presented, one might perceive
Balance as a necessary burden to carry, a chore that must be
performed.  In truth, it is a glorious thing, a gift granted to us
all, not a punishment.  But, one might argue, Balance dictates that
if you experience joy and pleasure, you must also at some point
experience pain.  How can that be a gift?
   
He who seeks an understanding of such an apparent paradox should
refrain from taking food or drink of any kind for an extended
period of time, until his mouth is parched and his stomache has
long since ceased rumbling from hunger.  After the time has passed,
he should partake of a simple meal, perhaps some Nendorian cakes
and water.  Provided the length of his fast was ample, the joy he 
feels, and the pleasure of relief in such a meagre banquet, is far
greater than he would have felt with a sumptuous array had he not
abstained.  The point of this is to understand the function of pain
and sacrifice - these things enhance the experiences of joy and
pleasure.  They bring focus into our lives.  And then a
comprehension of the gift of Balance is easy to grasp.  Balance is
that which takes our joys and makes them truly joyful, and our
pains and makes them truly painful.  In truth, it is that which
expands the sensation of life itself, for no life is without any
joy or any pain.  And in that, Balance is a great gift to us all.
~
E
wide3~
***The Necessity of Balance***

Having defined what is actually meant by Balance, the natural
question that arises is \#Why should this Balance be upheld?\#.  At 
the simplest level, the answer to this is that it is the natural 
way.  Evidence of this can be found all throughout nature - in the
daily interchange of sun and moons, in the lives and deaths of all
living creatures, in the cycle of seasons.  Even in the fascinating 
interplay of water and fire - the former will quench the latter,
but in the process neutralize itself into vapor - can this concept
of balance be found.  The original Three of the Pantheon, with or
without realizing it, created the world this way.

And example may be taken from those very Three.  One of the
light, one of the darkness, one of neither persuasion: in all, 
perfect balance.  At first glance, this may seem defeated by the
fact that each followed an orderly way.  But a slightly deeper 
understanding of the matter reveals that this is necessary, for 
balance to be acheived.  After all, before the form and order they
created, there was only chaos.  Their very lawfulness balanced this
disarray, and neatly completes the example.

Many reject the necessity of Balance, choosing instead to seek
personal gain. This reveals, however, the narrowness of their
scope.  For to defy the natural way is to place oneself at risk.
If excessive, nature itself will rebuke the imbalance.  This very
instance was exemplified in the raising up of the Goddess Girikha,
to offset the rigid control of the law.  Thus, ignoring or
attempting to overpower Balance for personal gain is an act doomed
to fail, unless somehow that force is stronger than nature itself
(and by extension, the might of all Three combined).

This section continues on the next page.
~
E
wide2~
***The Essence of Balance***

The term \@Balance\@, particularly as it relates to the Knights of Enaerai,
has been at times misunderstood.  One of the most common misconceptions of
this ideal semms to be the thought that there can nothing extreme in one\@s
life.  That somehow, all colors must be grey, all actions minimal and
mundane, all food bland, all excitement contained.  But such a lifestyle
would be unnecessarily unfulfilling.  No, the key to understanding what is
truly meant by Balance is to realize that for any phenomena, there is, or
should be, a counter-phenomena.  That is, if one side of the spectrum of
etremities is experienced, so should the other, in its turn.  Practically
speaking, this translates into the coexistance of, for example, good and
evil.  Or perhaps order and disorder.  

To understand this further, consider the analogue of a board of wood evenly
levelled atop a small rock.  When there is naught upon the board, it is
balanced.  However, it serves no purpose.  This is analogous to the world
ere it was populated with life - balanced, yet unfulfilled.  If an object of
uniform shape and weight is placed in the exact center of the board, the
setup will remain balanced.  For the sake of the analogy, assume that no
further objects can be placed atop this one, that is, that none of these are
stackable.  In that case, the board is level (and therefore acceptable), but
the system still has not achieved its full potential, as there remains a
great length of unladen board.  This is similar to the lifestyle described
in the beginning, that of blandness and relative inaction.  Indeed, it can
even be easily argued that such a way of life is inherently unbalanced in
and of itself, but that is not the point of this present explanation.  The
board has not reached its full potential until its entire length is covered,
in the middle and at both extremes.  And behold, that though there exist
objects at the extremities of the board - analogously, at the extremities of
life - the board remains level and balanced.  That is what is meant by
\@Balance\@: not the absence of extremes, but rather their equilibrium.

THE KACEAJKA ARTIFACT (PART 4)

What an exciting day!  After weeks of tinkering, I\@ve come by
the confidence to attempt an activation of the artifact.  A
simple twist, just so, with the runes and glyphs aligned to
resonate with some lesser earth magic ... and I\@ve managed to
glue my feet to the floor.  Rather painfully.

Some quick tests have assigned names to the magics observed
above:

(edit: Further study has allowed me to assign a class of
magic to the spells contained within, allowing for more
accurate invocations.)

When emanating blue, in order, moderate water leads to the
protections of sanctuary, moderate water again leads to a
scholar\@s healing touch, and strong water leads to a blast of
frost. (edit: These three, in order, may be recognized as
protective magic, healing magic, and ice magic.)

When emanating red, in order, strong fire calls upon Shiyul\@s
mighty fury, strong fire again connects the artifact with the
plane of fire, and powerful fire invokes a raging firestorm to
engulf the space. (edit: These three, in order, may be
recognized as destructive magic, flame magic, and
explosive magic.)

When emanating yellow, in order, lesser air lashes out a finger
of lightning, strong air weaves a rune to cloak the invoker, and
strong air again calls upon weaves of wind to bind the opponent.
(edit: These three, in order, may be recognized as lightning
magic, illusion magic, and wind magic.)

When emanating silver, in order, moderate earth reinforces the
invoker\@s skin with stone, lesser earth binds the opponent\@s
feet to the ground, and powerful earth calls down a meteor from
the heavens. (edit: These three, in order, may be recognized as
protective magic, encumberance magic, and destructive
magic.)

It takes the artifact a little over six hours between
activations to recover it\@s energy.  I wonder how it manages to
source the energy requ-[a splatter of blood crosses the page,
mixing ominously with patches of spilled ink]

I understand the source of the artifact\@s power.  There is a
chance, upon activation, that the Kaceajka artifact extract a
price from its wearer.  It feeds upon the wearer\@s life force,
draining a portion to power itself.  It is not merely payment,
however, but also a test - SOMETHING is opened and allows
through the Void itself.  A vershak, an incubus, an abishai -
guard yourself well or be consumed in the ordeal.

THE KACEAJKA ARTIFACT (PART 3)
   
I was wrong!  Careful studying has yielded an understanding of
the runes engraved upon the artifact.  Well, I was half-wrong.
Blue and red resonate with water and fire, respectively.  Yellow
and silver, however, resonate with air and earth, not earth and
spirit.  Rotating the runes properly will offer some
understanding of the magic contained within.  As far as I can
tell, there are three(?) different configurations of runes for
each sphere, each corresponding to some sort of lesser,
moderate, strong, or powerful magic.  The three configurations,
like the prior arrangements, always follow in the same order:
  
When arranged to emanate a faint blue aura, the runes may be
configured to resonate with moderate, a moderate, and a strong
water magics.
  
When arranged to emanate a faint red aura, the runes may be
configured to resonate with strong, strong, and powerful fire
magics.
  
When arranged to emanate a faint yellow aura, the runes may be

configured to resonate with lesser, strong, and strong air
magics.

When arranged to emanate a faint silver aura, the runes may be
configured to resonate with moderate, lesser, and powerful earth
magics.

THE KACEAJKA ARTIFACT (PART 2)

After long study, I have begun to understand how to operate this
artifact.  Method of activation is still unclear, but I am
beginning to make headway.  By manipulating the runes and
shifting the components mentioned earlier, I can change the
color of the aura emanating from the artifact.  I have
discovered four stable configurations so far.  Each
configuration may only be preceded by the same previous
configuration and may only lead to the same next configuration.
In order:

- A faint blue aura seems to indicate some sort of water magic,
I would think.

- A faint red aura clearly resonates with fire.

- A faint yellow aura...wind?  Earth?  I am unclear, so far, as
to the significance of yellow.

- A faint silver aura seems to be related to the sphere of
Spirit.

THE KACEAJKA ARTIFACT
           by Malwen of the Golden Flames

The Kaceajka artifact was entrusted to my hands by Kaceajka
Rhamti, the Iceguard, after the escape and recapture of Kzroth.
During Kzroth\@s escape, it was finely tuned to his signature,
allowing the bearer to absorb a capture a portion of his soul
with each activation.  Here begin my analysis of the artifact.
  
The basis of the Kaceajka artifact is drawn from the natural
order.  Twigs, vines, metals - these are the bricks.  Kankoran
fur, finely spun throughout the lattice, provides the mortar
(Note: Was kankoran-fur thread used a convenience or does the
choice hold some significance?  Reminder to ask Kaceajka Rhamti
for the identity of the fur-donor.).  The gaps in the material
allow a dim light, likely related to the same mechanism that
produces the hum.  A hand-sized hole on the bottom(?) provides
the only stable feature on the constantly shifting artifact.
  
Activating the artifact in Kzroth\@s presence was simple and
intuitive.  Outside of its initial purpose (Note: Was the
artifact created, or was it repurposed, to imprison Kzroth?),
some study is required before one may confidently activate the
artifact.  The following observations have been noted (The
Kaceajka artifact will be referred to as KA henceforth.).
Further avenues of research will be in parentheses:
  
- The KA is controlled through a series of internal sensors
(How?  Temperature?  Finger movement?).
   
- Various clusters on the KA resonate with each other, producing
various types of of auras when arranged together.
  
- A streak of darker magic flows through the KA (Related to the
KA\@s roots in Void magic?  Or residue from Kzroth?)
  
- The KA is not just formed from nature, but also seems to
intertwine druidic energy with more conventional magic.

- The threads of fur seem to be arranged in patterns beyond what
would be necessary to hold the KA together (Arrangement of
threads important?  See Void symbols).

- The intricate assembly indicates a manual expertise far beyond
the brown-furred kankorans of the Ryarl.

- There seems to be some sort of energy source embedded in the
KA.
  
- Currents of magic, both natural and conventional, seem to flow
along the strands of fur (Does the fur conduct the magic, or
does the arrangement provide a guide?).
  
- Various runes along the surface of the KA attract and repulse
each other in some indeterminate fashion.  Shifting portions of
the artifact to rearrange the runes causes the entire surface to
reshape itself (Obviously important.  How?).
  
- The runes, mentioned above, are etched in the pieces of metal
embedded in the artifact (Type of metal important, e.g. copper
vs iron?).

In ones reflections and considerations of balance, the individual must
consider how acts or other expressions of free will can be measured 
against other acts.  Recall an over-arching principle of all aspects of
balance, Talkymirs Maxim: \#Balance is not the absence of extremes, but
rather their equilibrium\#.  And so it is with inner balance, applied 
to the characteristics of the individual.  There are always opposing
forces, but it is their equilibrium which brings one into the proper
measure. Looking at particular characteristic, a particular personality
flaw or feature, or considering the deeds of a Knight on a particular
day may give one a skewed vision of that Knights personal balance,
and there are many who consider the knights in the light of particular
circumstance and pass quick and ignorant judgement about 
inner balance. But it is his or her being as a whole, based the 
elemental foundation of the body, actuated through the will and 
manifest through word and deed, throughout the entirety of experience
and life-all these over time form the whole of the inner balance of 
a soul.

And so the exercise of free will through actions made, decisions taken,
beliefs held, characteristics manifest, and words spoken, may not 
represent a perfect balance in and of themselves, yet should, upon 
reflection, be held against physical nature, and ALL deeds, decisions,
beliefs, characteristics, and words.  The sum of all should be a
return to neutrality.

This truism may in turn lead to the fact that the older one becomes, 
the less, comparatively, each deed influences the personal measure. 
Those of very advanced age may find it impossible to balance a life 
lived at the extremes.  On the other hand, those who die in youth are
disadvantaged, in that their deeds impact their whole measure more 
intensely, and their lives are less likely to have been well-balanced.
Most have a natural feel for this unsteadiness of youth, but misattribute
it to a lack of development or experience. But it is chiefly in the 
summer and autumn of life that one may most effectively pursue and 
attain a high measure of personal balance.  If attained, it can then 
be honed in small degree to an even greater equilibrium in the winter
of life.

Few if any mortals can achieve such a mastery of will that the sum 
of their lives results in a total perfection of neutrality.  Yet it
is in following a life that aspires to such, that those whose souls
are bound to the altars of neutrality will find greatest fulfilment.
~
E
volume4~
How do we mortals then achieve an inner balance?  This question is, 
ironically, more pertinent to the followers of neutrality than to those 
who align themselves with the extreme opposing forces.  Those who shun 
balance in all its aspects will have no use for the concept of inner 
balance, and such individuals stand against each other in the measure of 
deeper balance, an aspect which will be discussed in later volumes.
  
According to the Principle of Omnipresent Measure, everything that exists 
is imbued with some innate degree or combination of the many opposing 
forces.  Take, for example, a simple stone.  Being of the element of earth,
it possesses characteristics of stability (order, or law) in abundance.  
A gust of air, of course, stands opposed, with its chaotic and wild nature.
In all things that exist these connections to opposing forces are found
in varying degrees.

Our mortal bodies, too, are composed of the raw elemental materials of 
the prime, in such a way that they have balance and reach equilibrium, 
allowing the spirit of life to dwell within.  It is to be noted, however,
that the elemental equilibrium of bodily form is not the same in all races.  
Nefortu and kankorans have a preponderance of air, it is said, while 
caladarans and ethron have one of water. The srryn are more grounded in
the element of fire. It has been argued that aelins, and even moreso, 
humans, are the most naturally balanced of the races in terms of raw 
elemental forces which form them, and that this accounts for the great
diversity in how the opposing forces are manifest through their actions,
as well as the consequent impact on other aspects of balance.

Inner balance is only partially dictated, however, by concerns of 
corporeal form, unless one considers the void-dominated nature of shuddeni
and the spirit-dominated nature of chtaren.  Both are incapable of 
achieving a true inner balance. But for most races, as expressed 
earlier, it is free will itself that may guide one, over time and 
through experience, to a balanced life, despite the natural corporeal 
influence of the flesh.  The will of Grujnah led him to become Thales-yet
the will of others has just as often led to greater imbalance, as the will
is enticed by the dreams of security and peace of light or the greed for
the depraved power of dark.

Disciples of true neutrality, in seeking inner balance, will therefore
do as Thales didseek a proper perspective through consideration, 
reflection, and reasoning.  Thales had thirty years to argue his 
precepts before the wisest sages of Avendar, but mortals do not have
such time. Among the Knights of Balance, a need was recognized for a
time to step back from the concerns of daily life, important as they
may be, and reflect on matters of personal balance (among other 
things), and so Mettenday, the first calendar day of each month, 
became a holy day among them.
~
E
volume3~
Inner balance is, in essence, a personal equilibrium, the measure of 
balance within an individual. It is commonly said that those who are 
mentally unstable are unbalanced, but this is a misleading expression.  
Inner balance is directly not correlated to standard mental functioning 
(though of course it would no doubt be affected by such). Inner balance 
does have primarily to do with the possession of intellect, and even 
moreso, with the greatest gift and curse the Gods have given mortals: 
free will.  

The ability of the mind to, of its own purpose and accord, remember,
question, reason, and predict is powerful, even in those of minor 
intellect.  Action based on thought, feeling, or initiated by instinct 
while influenced by environment and countless other factors and forces,
is at the ultimate root of threats to balance in any of its aspects.
With inner balance, however, this is especially the case, because the
scope is limited to the individual.  

In a long-ago era age now lost to legend, the greatest sages and wisest 
lore-masters of old once strove against a corrupt demigod named Grujnah.
How and why the conflict between Grujnah and the sages arose is unclear,
lost in the mists of time (though one questionable tale has it that the
debate began over the amount of holy water it would take to completely 
fill the emptiness of the Void). Yet to this day, one can see in the Hall
of Pillars at Nathli the relief depicting the great philosophical debate 
between them.  It is recorded that the debate lasted thirty years, and 
only ended when the demigod at last admitted the flaws in his reasoning.
From thereafter Grujnah became known as Thales, and took a place among
the Lords of Balance.

How Grujnah-Thales, a being imbued with divine power, could change in
position due to intellect and will is a significant example of the effect
of will and reason.  How much greater the effect on beings so weak 
(comparatively speaking) as we mortals.  Thales becomes a prime example 
to all who seek wisdom and purpose, both in his willingness to reflect 
and turn a debate to his own ways and walk of life, and in his ultimate
wisdom in turning to follow the surest path.
~
E
volume2~
To that end, I propose the following framework for considerations of 
the primary aspects of balance:
  
1) Thales: The Inner Balance, or Balance of the Soul
2) Enirra: The Faction Balance, or the Balance of Mortal Powers
3) Chadraln: The World Balance, or Balance of Avendar
4) Kelaith: The Universal Balance, or Balance of the Greater Powers
  
Each may be defined in terms of historical development and current 
weighting, as well as basic underpinning principles. I have associated 
each with a particular deity or power representation of balance, in 
addition, to help identify and illustrate its nature.
  
Experienced philosophers of balance may argue that this framework, 
useful as it may prove, is still limited.  Indeed it is. It may, 
however, serve as a beginning point for novices in their study of 
balance, allowing them a ready approach for their research into the
of neutrality scholarship.

The remainder of this text will be devoted to a discussion and analysis 
of the first, and beginning principle of balance: Thalean Balance, the
Inner Balance, or the balance of one\@s own soul.

ASPECTS OF BALANCE
                 Volume 1, the Balance of the Soul
                    
                        by Garrod Delende
  
What is the balance?  There are many views on the nature of balance, and 
over the centuries, many have disputed and even entered into armed 
conflict over the principals of the true measure.  Why is this the case?  
  
One of the biggest reasons for this confusion is the inability to recognize
one very important fact:  the concept of balance encompasses many things.
Many who have argued over balance are really arguing over separate and 
distinct matters. The word \#balance\# is widely and generally applied in
many areas, not all of which overlap.  
  
Imagine two scholars debating whether the concept of color is best seen in
that which is red or that which is blue.  Or imagine two sages disputing 
whether oak, elm or pine best represents the notion of tree.  Such 
debates are, of course, pointless. Our notion of color encompasses both 
the red and the blue, as well as the myriad other hues and shades and 
tones. The simplest of woodsmen would easily observe that oak, elm, pine
and countless other species are all trees.
  
So it is when searching for a deeper understanding of the principles of
balance. One must first understand that the concept of balance is 
multifaceted before one can understand the principles at play. One must
not let semantic vagaries or the inadequacy of the common lexicon hinder
a full understanding and appreciation of the ways of balance.

The Dream is not, as some scholars have intimated, simply a pocket dimension
attached to the prime material.  It certainly does not have an independent
existence like the true greater planes, but its vast, nearly infinite extent
teems with a diversity of content and form.  
  
Some have called the Dream a shadow -- others, a mirror.  Both are to some
extent correct, for the dream is in large part a reflection of the world of
the prime material.  But, in its farthest regions, beyond the places tread
by mortal kind, there are sections of the Dream which are completely
divorced from any physical reality of which we are aware.  Could the Dream
reflect other physical realities?  
  
The dream is also unique in that the minds of even the most commonplace
mortal will most likely touch it during the course of their life.  The
experience of touching the altered reality of the Dream is something most
will ascribe to a natural phenomena, but in reality it points to the
extremely deep psychic bonds which exist between the prime and the Dream.  
  
But consistent study of the Dream requires more than the random and
fragmentary visions of sleep.  The methods of contacting the dream are
numerous, and, perhaps, even infinite.  The \#veil\#, or planar boundary

marble smooth column columns row rows~
These marble columns are roughly two feet in diameter, made from
glass-smooth marble of a pale, milky color.  Stretching from the floor to
the ceiling, they fill the room, humming ever so faintly with the massive
amounts of protective magics woven about them.  Rows of matte-black runes
encircle the bases and the pedimentsm, predominantly of protective and
defensive natures.  Contained within are the original copies of all the
works for the library above, preserved here against the ravages of time.  No
visible method can be seen of opening or otherwise accessing the contents.

the ribcage.  The skeleton lies sprawled on the ground, one arm reaching
helplessly towards the northern wall.  The reaching arm is severed neatly
just below the wrist, apparently caught by the grinding wall.

The Foyer of the Earendam Library~
The foyer to the Grand Library of Earendam is an impressive room, painted
in a pale peach.  A wide, polished floor is made from smooth grey marble,
which runs in sweeping, curving twin stairs to the west and east.  The
stairs meet at a wide balcony above, which looks over a gilded wooden
railing down onto the foyer.  Tall windows stretch the height of the
fourteen-foot walls along the northern front of the room, looking out onto
West Qalnistra street.  A large bronzed door provides access out that way. 
In the large bay created by the curves of the stairs, a tall statue stands,
regal and dominant.  A pressed plaster ceiling is painted the same rich
cream as the trim.  Several portraits hang along the eastern and western
walls, and the southern wall is mostly obscured by the balcony above.

floor marble smooth grey~
The wide floor of the Foyer is made from smooth grey marble.  Large
circles of paler, gold marble punctuate the refined, glossy floor, bordered
with bars of pure white marble.  The sweeping stairs are also made from the
smooth white stone.  
~
E
tall statue~
This large statue is of a tall, nobly-carved humanoid figure.  Made from
roseate granite, the statue depicts a virile caladaran with
uncharacteristically broad shoulders, a V-shaped torso, and a muscular
physique.  A cleft chin and a rakish angle to the chin further hint at the
roguish charm the sculptor sought to convey.  A shaved head bears a simple
silver circlet, the figure swathed in robes of stone carved with immense
realism.  A staff is clenched in one strong hand, slightly tilted outwards
as if daring the world.  A slight smile haunts the granite lips, the eyes
large and expressive.  

A small door has been partially obscured by the large statue.

E

This luxuriant ceiling is detailed in pressed plaster, coffered and

~
E
window windows~
These tall glass windows stretch from floor to ceiling, fitted with large
panes of thick, wavy glass.  Each pane is rippled and textured to the point
of near-opacity, the glazing-work of the windows clearly many centuries old.
~
E
portrait portraits~
There are two portraits on the western wall, and three on the eastern. 
You may \@look eastern1\@, etc.
~
E
eastern1~
This simple portrait seems a relatively generic painting of a stodgy,
grey-haired matron in a black dress and a wimple.  She holds a red book in
her left hand, posing primly.  The picture is old and faded with time, the
oil paint cracking.
~
E
eastern2~
This small portrait shows a fat, bearded man, dressed in opulent,
gem-encrusted robes.  A risibly enormous quill pen made from a turquoise
peacock feather, easily the length of his arm, is clutched in his pudgy
fingers.  
~
E
eastern3~
This round portrait is a simple pastel rendition of a vague humanoid
shape.  Wan and pale to begin with, age has rendered the painting nearly
blank.  Possibly caladaran, the figure is clad in robes which might have
once been painted in hues of red and gold.  
~
E
western1~
This round portrait depicts a gaunt nefortu, one eye a ruined mass of
scars.  Clearly not intended as a flattering picture, the painting is done
in rich oil.  Simple pale grey robes hang loosely on the nefortu\@s frame, a
small, ebony pen held casually between two clawed fingers.  
~
E
western2~
This regal portrait depicts a diminuitive, aged ethron, dressed in
unremarkable robes.  He clutches a gnarled staff in his ancient hands, and a
slender crown perches in his wispy hair.  Large eyes have been painted with
a piercing, shrewd gaze, and his mouth is twisted in a smile.

A Small Side-Chamber~
This small chamber is painted a simple teal, faded from the years.  The
floor is well-worn stone, possibly still the original floor of the building.
Ancient iron hooks protrude through the plaster walls, pitted and corroded. 
Apparently a coat-room, this small chamber is lit by a lone torch, magically
contained within a frosted glass globe.  A wooden door leads out of the room
to the north.

A Gallery Above the Foyer~
The foyer to the Grand Library of Earendam is an impressive room,
painted in a pale peach.  This upper section of the foyer is a wide gallery
which overlooks the main body of the room.  Wide marble stairs curve down
from the eastern and western ends of the balcony to the floor.  A gilded
wooden rail, each spindle a curvaceous work of art, stands at the edge of
the gallery.  Each newel-post is topped with a frosted crystal globe which
glows brightly.  The walls are painted a pale peach, and the plaster ceiling
painted the same cream as the trim.  Tall windows look out onto the street
from the floor below, and an equally-tall granite statue rises from the bay
between the stairs, its head roughly on level with yours.  An open archway
opens into the library proper to the south.

This large statue is of a tall, nobly-carved humanoid figure.  Made from
roseate granite, the statue depicts a virile caladaran with
uncharacteristically broad shoulders, a V-shaped torso, and a muscular
physique.  Its face cannot be seen from this angle.  A shaved head bears a
simple silver circlet, the figure swathed in robes of stone carved with
immense realism.  A staff is clenched in one strong hand, slightly tilted
outwards as if daring the world.  
~
E
gild gilt gilded wooden wood rail spindle newel newel-post post frosted crystal globe~
This intricate wooden railing is made from strong, delicate goldenwood,
imported from Alensha.  Series of curvaceous, bulbous spindles,
aesthetically pleasing, seem light and breathlessly fragile.  The vertical
pieces of wood are mounted between two rails of heavier oak, varnished to a
clear gloss.  Newel-posts, gilded like the spindles, are mounted with
twining brass sconces which cup and cradle frosted glass orbs.

between tall stacks of shelves built from dark wood.  Books press in on both
sides, of all imaginable sizes, materials, and colors.  The twenty-foot
ceiling ends above your head in a curving barrel-vault of pale stone.  Iron
wheeled ladders run across the faces of the shelves on oiled metal tracks,
allowing access to the more distant shelves.  To the south, the north wing
continues, and a large open archway leads out into the foyer to the north. 
Pressed plaster decorations throng along the edge of the archway.  The air
is quiet, heavy, and cool, filled with the dusty smells of age and
parchment.

rise and sink into and out of the archway, giving the entire embellishment
the air of fluidity and movement.  Many of the figures, most of ambiguous,
featureless races, wield tiny tin weapons.  Gilt and turquoise paint has
been used extensively to color the plaster decorations, along with a few
more muted hues.

ascending nearly to the bottom of the Dome and broken only by the balconied

Pantheon.  The gleaming parquet floor of the High Room is dotted with wooden
benches and chairs at many tables.  The towering walls are completely
covered by dark wooden bookshelves, ascending nearly to the bottom of the
Dome and broken only by the balconied galleries on the third level.  A crest
of beaten brass is fitted into the floor here, and tall archways in the

seventy feet above, the large brass medallion is nearly five feet in

The High Room~
The High Room of the Library is a vast enclosed space.  A full five
stories tall, the room stretches away to the west and north.  Far above you,
the enormous Great Dome caps the room, the inside painted with a fresco of
the Pantheon.  The gleaming parquet floor of the High Room is dotted with
wooden benches and chairs at many tables.  The eastern and southern walls
and indeed, all the walls, are completely covered by dark wooden
bookshelves, ascending nearly to the bottom of the Dome and broken only by
the balconied galleries on the third level.  In the center of the room a
large crest is fitted into the floor, and a small door opens in the stacks
to the south.  The air is quiet, heavy, and cool, filled with the dusty
smells of age and parchment.

gleaming parquet floor down~
The gleaming parquet floor of the High Room is made from thick, solid
shapes of exotic hardwoods.  Expertly carved in geometric, simple shapes,
the pieces are fitted masterfully together in elaborate patterns.  Varnished
and sanded to a silken finish, the floor is well-tended, the opulent woods
tastefully laid out and maintained.

A Small Reading-Room~
The walls in this simple but opulent reading room are painted a rich
burgundy, the ceiling a neutral white.  Wooden molding, a dark, stained
maple, runs around the room at waist-height, carved with symbols of study
and learning.  A small sidetable stands near the western wall, and a tall
lamp in the corner holds a brightly-glowing frosted crystal ball.  A wooden
door, painted and fitted with molding to blend in with the wall, leads to
the north.  A gilt-framed mirror hangs on the western wall, and a selection
of stuffed heads and birds are mounted on plaques on the southern wall.

E
bright brightly glowing frosted crystal ball~
This round crystal globe is four inches in diameter, the surface frosted
to an opaque white.  It glows with a constant, bright yellow light, giving
off no heat.  It rests in an ornate, gold-plated sconce of gleaming brass. 
Wrought to resemble a vine springing from the brass plate which affixes it
to the wall, the sconce curls the globe in a spiralling, metallic grasp.  
~
E
hyloth salmon~
This unremarkable salmon is scaled in a range of greys which fades from a
pale off-white at the belly to a deep, rich silver at the finned back.  The
fish is glazed in a clear, hard varnish, mounted on a plain wooden plaque.  
~
E
rock lizard~
This smallish lizard is covered on its back and sides with lumpy,
irregular scales whose stony bulk are part armor and part camouflage.  Its
underside is pale and weak, however, the sideways-splayed limbs and flat
head mounted in frozen mid-motion.  Dull black eyes stare out at the room.  
~
E
jasa trout~
This large specimen of Jasa trout\@s scales have dulled slightly in death,
their iridescent rainbow faded somewhat and allowing the more muted drab
olive beneath to show through.  A pale belly and black eyes have been kept
glistening with some clear, hard varnish.  The fish is rather large, over
two feet in length.  
~
E
spice finch~
This small stuffed bird is wired to a dusty branch, its white-spotted
body positioned mid-leap, halfway between landing and flight.  A small
orange beak and tiny black eyes protrude from the solid brown head.  
~
E
griffin~
This stuffed griffin\@s head is nearly identical to that of the golden
eagle, the glossy brown-gold feathers covering the proud, aerodynamic skull
smoothly.  A ferocious, sharp beak of orange-yellow has a feral, unabashedly
predatorial curve to it, sitting beneath the wild silver eyes.  
~
E
grizzly bear~
This large bear\@s head must have been taken from a truly enormous
specimen.  The heavy, boxy skull is wreathed in rolls of stuffed fur which
emulates fat admirably.  The squarish snout is open in a silent roar, large,
dull teeth glinting dangerously in the light.  A large black nose has been
dessicated for preservation\@s sake, and seems somewhat shriveled and out of
place among the glossy fur.  The round ears are laid back along the head,
and the smallish, yellow-orange eyes peer fiercely out from under a low
brow.  
~
E
granite drake~
This stony-scaled head is cut from a medium-sized drake, a smaller
variant of the legendary dragons.  An elongated, square snout has an almost
beak-like point, serrated, triangular teeth lined in fearsome rows inside
the powerful jaws.  Large, perceptive eyes (now glass) sit below crested
brows, the beginning of almost platelike scales starting between them to run
down the back of the neck.  
~
E
bull bjorcha~
This large, cowlike head is covered in curly, wooly hair of a
greyish-brown hue.  A sloping, bony forehead sports two short,
sharply-curved horns, the dull eyes set wide apart.  A tufted beard hangs
from the jutting chin.  
~
E
lynx~
This lynx\@s head is rather larger than a domestic cat.  More
aggressively-bewhiskered, the lynx\@s fur is a sandy tawn striped with
elongated black dots.  Characteristic black tufts adorn the ears, and the
mouth is prised open in a convincing snarl.  Orange glass eyes have been
mounted in the sockets, and almost seem to move of their own volition,
perhaps through some enchantment.  
~
E
south southern selection stuffed head heads bird birds plaques plaque mount mounted~
The southern wall is covered with an impressive array of heads and other
taxidermied specimens.  Particularly prominent are the heads of a lynx, bull
bjorcha, granite drake, grizzly bear, and a griffin, and the stuffed bodies
of a spice finch, Jasa trout, rock lizard, and Hyloth salmon.  
~
E
gilt mirror gilt-framed framed west western~
A large, oval mirror made from age-rippled glass backed with silver hangs
on the western wall.  Encircled in a heavy, gilt-plaster frame, it reflects
the room dully and helps to give the slight illusion of increased roominess.
~
E
runic symbol symbols carved study learning~
Ornamental, runic-style symbols are carved into the wood with some sort
of heated metal tool, stylized in the manner of focusing and concentrating
symbols of power.  
~
E
wooden molding dark stained maple~
The ornate molding is done in dark, reddish stained maple wood, the trim
carved in a dentils frieze.  The tiny cubes of wood are alternated with
equal-sized spaces to create the impression of inverted battlements.  The
rest of the baseboard-style molding runs down from the waist-high
faux-railing which constitutes the trim, panelling the lower half of the
wall in the same, rich red maple wood.  Ornamental, runic-style symbols are
carved into the wood with some sort of heated metal tool, stylized in the
manner of focusing and concentrating symbols of power.

The Map Room~
This small reading room is made from chill stone.  Maps cover every inch
of the walls, and the curved plaster ceiling is painted with a map of
Avendar.  A pair of frosted crystal globes fill the room with buttery yellow
light, mounted on gilded sconces on the walls.  A small table of polished
cherry sits in the center of the room, a pair of high-backed chairs facing
each other across it.  The floor is made from polished wood.  A powder-blue
door leads out of the room, the ancient brass latch-lift fashioned in the
shape of the Hourglass.

This nondescript table is an oval of rich, reddish cherry wood.  Four

tabletop on their backs.  A small paper-shelf has been fitted on the
underside of the table.

A powder-blue door leads out of the room, fitted with an ancient
latch-lift wrought in the shape of an hourglass.  Intricate detailing has
been painted on the door in gilt, four small sprays of flowers among a
tracery of golden vines.

The High Room~
The High Room of the Library is a vast enclosed space.  A full five
stories tall, the room stretches away to the south and east.  Far above you,
the enormous Great Dome caps the room, the inside painted with a fresco of
the Pantheon.  The gleaming parquet floor of the High Room is dotted with
wooden benches and chairs at many tables.  The northern wall and indeed, all
the walls, are completely covered by dark wooden bookshelves, ascending
nearly to the bottom of the Dome and broken only by the balconied galleries
on the third level.  In the center of the room a large crest is fitted into
the floor, and a small door opens in the stacks to the north.  The air is
quiet, heavy, and cool, filled with the dusty smells of age and parchment.

gleaming parquet floor down~
The gleaming parquet floor of the High Room is made from thick, solid
shapes of exotic hardwoods.  Expertly carved in geometric, simple shapes,
the pieces are fitted masterfully together in elaborate patterns.  Varnished
and sanded to a silken finish, the floor is well-tended, the opulent woods
tastefully laid out and maintained.

The High Room~
The High Room of the Library is a vast enclosed space.  A full five
stories tall, the room stretches away to the south, east, and north.  Far
above you, the enormous Great Dome caps the room, the inside painted with a
fresco of the Pantheon.  The gleaming parquet floor of the High Room is
dotted with wooden benches and chairs at many tables.  The western wall and
indeed, all the walls, are completely covered by dark wooden bookshelves,
ascending nearly to the bottom of the Dome and broken only by the balconied
galleries on the third level.  In the center of the room a large crest is
fitted into the floor, and a tall archway opens in the western shelves,
leading to the west wing.  The air is quiet, heavy, and cool, filled with
the dusty smells of age and parchment.

tastefully laid out and maintained.

A Small Reading-Room~
This small reading room is nicely appointed with a short, plump couch
upholstered in pale green velvet.  A tall, secretarial-style desk stands
against the eastern wall.  A framed sketch of an artic scene hangs on the
southern wall.  The room is illumined by three frosted crystal globes which
glow brightly with yellow-white light, mounted in gleaming gold sconces. 
The plaster walls are painted in a pale peach, and the ceiling and trim in
glossy cream.  A wooden door, painted cream with highlights of gilt, sits in
the northern wall.

These pieces of ceramic seem randomly twisted into bizarre, disfigured

rust-orange, the sculptures seem to have been tucked out of the way for
their uninteresting natures, rather than stowed out of jealously.  
~
E
tall secretary secretarial style secretarial-style desk east eastern~
This tall desk dominates the eastern wall.  Built from heavy slabs of
dark walnut, the desk stretches from floor to ceiling.  Its front hangs open
and parallel to the floor, supported by a pair of sturdy chains, and acts as
the writing-surface of the desk.  Behind it, rows of small cubbyholes,
paper-boxes, and inkstands nestle among other academic paraphenalia.  A
small, empty cabinet squats in the space underneath the main desk, and the
glass-fronted cabinet above the desk contains a few rather ugly pieces of
ceramic sculpture.  
~
E
frame framed sketch artic scene south southern~
This simple sketch is framed in a handsome teak-and-sandalwood frame, the
lighter and darker woods fitted together in a complex, knotlike pattern. 
Sketched with a rather skillful flair for the dramatic interplay of light
and dark, the charcoal drawing depicts a stark icefield stretching away
before you.  Harsh shadows and wisping, wind-blown snow create illusions of
movement in the motionless piece of art.  A tiny tower stands resolutely in
the distance, perched on a jutting headland.

The East Stairwell~
This ancient stone stairwell consists of a circular shaft in the eastern
wing of the library.  Walled in some dark, grainy stone worn smooth from the
years, the stairwell spirals sharply upwards.  An intricate stained glass
window, thin and narrow, helps to light the steep, cramped stairs with the
aid of a small, feebly-glowing orb of crystal mounted in a gleaming brass
sconce.  The stairs end here, opening out onto a bookshelf-lined hallway to

and old, old books.  A feeble glass globe, frosted white, emanates a pale,
poor yellow light at the end of the alcove, but the ancient tomes and

This plain stone room is built entirely from dark, banded gneiss.  A wide

to allow access to the deep-red door in the northern wall.  Fragments and
tablets of stone are carefully laid out on the counters.  A small pair of

the other a quantity of thin parchments for tracing.  A frosted crystal
globe hangs from the ceiling, illuminating the room with steady light.

stools are set before the tables, a simple quill-rest and inkstand built
into each place.  The silence of the rest of the library seems positively
uproarious compared to the deathly, rigid absence of sound here.  Frosted
crystal globes hang from the ceiling at regular intervals, bathing the room
in constant bright-yellow light.  The room continues to the south, and a

smells of age and parchment.

The West Wing~
The west wing of the vast Grand Library stretches away to the east
between tall stacks of shelves built from dark wood, and a smaller corridor
in the canyon of books intersects it running north and south.  Books press
in on both sides, of all imaginable sizes, materials, and colors.  Above,
you can look up a tall open space to the third floor.  Iron wheeled ladders
run across the faces of the shelves on oiled metal tracks, allowing access
to the more distant shelves.  The air is quiet, heavy, and cool, filled with
the dusty smells of age and parchment.  Westwards, a small gap in the
bookshelves reveals an open archway leading into a small stairwell.

The West Stairwell~
This ancient stone stairwell consists of a circular shaft in the western
wing of the library.  Walled in some dark, grainy stone worn smooth from the
years, the stairwell spirals sharply upwards.  An intricate stained glass
window, thin and narrow, helps to light the steep, cramped stairs with the
aid of a small, feebly-glowing orb of crystal mounted in a gleaming brass
sconce.  The stairs end here, opening out onto a bookshelf-lined hallway to
the east.

This stained window is made from geometric pieces of colored glass

in the tall, narrow window, centering about aquamarine triangles which orbit
wine-purple octagons.  The mosaic pattern is laid out with a precise eye for
aesthetics and color balance, a specific place for every shade and shape and
every shade and shape in its place.  The window glows softly with secondhand
sunlight reflected off of the temple of Jolinn to the west, the light giving
each carefully-selected color a rich vividness and vibrance.

A Blank Study~
This room is startingly ascetic.  A plain wooden table, unpolished and
empty, sits in the middle of the room.  One plain glass globe hangs from the
ceiling by three links of iron chain, illuminating the room in harsh white
light.  The dull plaster walls are painted a blank ivory, as is the ceiling.
The cold stone floor is made from tightly-fitted granite, the masonry
clearly very old.

Professor Sondakuan\@s Study~
This study seems to have been long-empty.  A fine patina of dust covers
the rich ebony desk and the bare shelves above it.  A frosted crystal globe
illumines the room, hanging by a chain from the ceiling.  The plaster walls
and ceiling, painted an odd, deep shade of violet, are cobwebbed in the
corners.  The ancient stone floor of polished granite is in need of a
sweeping.  A simple door leads to the west.

A Twin Study~
This study is relatively large, and is furnished for two to use the space
as an office.  Against the north and south walls sit large desks: one
mahogany and the other a light, nondescript fir.  The plaster walls are
painted a subtle teal, light and airy.  Covering most of the eastern wall is
a large, decorative rug, elaborately designed to illustrate the world of
Avendar.  A crystal globe illuminates the room with steady light in a
gleaming brass sconce.  A foldable canvas cot sits next to the mahogany
desk, and a plush, elevated bed abuts the other.  A small set of lightly
varnished oak bookshelves sit in the northeastern corner, mostly empty.  A
plain wooden door leads out to the west.

This plain room is walled in dark, banded gneiss.  The smooth, striated
stone is hung with blank grey tapestries.  A simple pair of desks sit in the
middle of the room, lit by a frosted crystal globe hanging from the ceiling.
A massive oak file cabinet squats against the western wall, and another
against the east.  A tin-clad door sits in the northern wall, fitted with an

A Private Study~
This simple study is panelled in simple pine.  A wide, curving desk of
the same wood dominates the small, cell-like room.  The eastern wall is
covered completely by bookshelves.  A brass lamp on the desk is mounted with
a frosted crystal globe, illuminating the room with bright-yellow light. 
The ceiling is glossy plaster, painted with a simple chart of Avendar\@s
moons and some of the more commonly-known stars.  A wooden door leads west,
fitted with an ancient brass latch-lift.

This simple lamp has an inverted pear shape, cast in dully-gleaming
brass.  Decorative leaves and stems of the same metal twine about the body,
several tendrils curling up and over the frosted globe of glowing crystal
which rests on top.  The lamp seems to have been handled quite a bit, the
distinctive wear of five fingers and a palm showing about the slender base. 
It appears to be firmly attached to the desk, despite its frequent handling.

Above the Great Crest~
The High Room of the Library is a vast enclosed space.  A full five
stories tall, the room stretches away in all directions.  Far above you, the
enormous Great Dome caps the room, the inside painted with a fresco of the
Pantheon.  The gleaming parquet floor of the High Room below is dotted with
wooden benches and chairs.  The towering walls are completely covered by
dark wooden bookshelves, ascending nearly to the bottom of the Dome and
broken only by the balconied galleries on the third level.  A crest of
beaten brass is fitted into the floor below you, and tall archways in the
distant walls lead out of the room in the four cardinal directions.  The air
is quiet, heavy, and cool, filled with the dusty smells of age and
parchment.

The East Stairwell~
This ancient stone stairwell consists of a circular shaft in the eastern
wing of the library.  Walled in some dark, grainy stone worn smooth from the
years, the stairwell spirals sharply upwards.  An intricate stained glass
window, thin and narrow, helps to light the steep, cramped stairs with the
aid of a small, feebly-glowing orb of crystal mounted in a gleaming brass
sconce.  The stairs continue above and below, the dusty air cool and quiet.

The stained glass window here is done in swirling shards and lines of
bright colors.  All shades and hues of green and emerald dominate this tall,
slitlike window, forming the brilliant background to a curling vine done in
a darker verde.  Beautiful, heart-shaped flowers spring from the sinuous,
vivacious vine, each blossom a glowing crimson.  The entire window beams
with the radiance of the sun, basking in its light.

nighttime_window~
The stained glass window here is done in swirling shards and lines of
what seems to be a dull green.  The tall, slitlike window is dark, the
nighttime light insufficient to reveal the artistry of the glasswork.  A
curling green vine with reddish flowers or leaves seems central to the work,
the greenery listless without the sunlight.

This ancient stone stairwell consists of a circular shaft in the

The stained window here is made from jagged, sharp pieces of thick, dark
glass.  A background of an unsettling mustardy green-yellow seems
smoke-streaked and unclear, the focus of the window an erratic, skittering
line of deepest black.  The little sunlight on the far side of the window
struggles to backlight the thick window, the dark line almost runic in
nature.

illumination, the sickly greenish-ochre background pulsing with a different
sort of light.  With the odd background of such bizarre, shifting light, the
dark line - almost runic in nature - seems to twitch and move beneath your
gaze in some optical illusion of masterful work.

well-maintained.  The air is cool and smells of dust and old books, still
and quiet.

The East Stairwell~
This ancient stone stairwell consists of a circular shaft in the eastern
wing of the library.  Walled in some dark, grainy stone worn smooth from the
years, the stairwell spirals sharply upwards.  An intricate stained glass
window, thin and narrow, helps to light the steep, cramped stairs with the
aid of a small, feebly-glowing orb of crystal mounted in a gleaming brass
sconce.  The stairs end here, opening out onto a bookshelf-lined hallway to

The stained glass window here is done in swirling shards and lines of
bright colors.  All shades and hues of blue and azure dominate this tall,
slitlike window, forming a dappled, wavelike pattern of a sun-bathed sea.  A
small ship of radiant white and gold froths along these abstract waves,
glowing brilliantly.  The entire window beams with the radiance of the sun,
basking in its light.
~

The stained glass window here is done in swirling shards and lines of

The stained window is made from chunky, assymetric pieces of smoky glass
soldered together with lead.  A background of deep, twilight-violet is
nearly indistinguishable from the central dark figure; the daylight on the
other side of the window seems indirect and unable to make it through the
thick, dark glass.

E
nighttime_window~
The stained window is made from chunky, assymetric pieces of smoky glass
soldered together with lead.  A background of deep, twilight-violet seems to
be imbued with its own bizarre type of illumination, skirting the edges of
the standard light spectrum.  An odd effect caused by either an enchantment
or a skillfully-crafted optical illusion, the violet background seems to
shift and pulse with parastaltic motion.  A central figure, stretched to fit
the proportions of the tall, narrow window, stands with undefinable power
and menace.  Cloaked and cowled in dark grey, the figure has little
definition of its own and is more visible as a darkness against the semi-lit
backdrop of sickly purple.

This stained window is made from geometric pieces of colored glass
soldered with lead.  An abstract yet rigidly symmetrical pattern is formed
in the tall, narrow window, octagons made from groups of sixteen triangles. 
The dominant colors are a rust-orange and a soft, dusky midnight blue.  A
backdrop of more subtle pastel trapezoids provides an oddly fitting
contrast, the window glowing with reflected daylight from outside.

This stained window is made from geometric pieces of colored glass

the insufficient light of nighttime.

Over the High Room~
Hovering halfway between the Great Dome and the polished floor of the
vast enclosed space which is the High Room, you are surrounded by shelves
and shelves of books which completely cover the walls.  Thirty feet below
you, the floor is covered with chairs and benches, four large archways
leading off the massive room.  Roughly at your level, the shelves are broken
by open balconies onto the third level of the building.  High above the
Great Dome curves overhead, capping the enormous room like a crown.

The Top of the Great Dome~
You hover beneath the Great Dome.  Over thirty feet in diameter, this
massive dome is the architectural crown to the vast, regal High Room which
is the center of the Library.  A wide clerestory six feet tall rings the
bottom of the dome, allowing one to look out over the city.  Runed pillars
support the dome above the band of windows.  The curving plaster interior of
the dome is painted in a breathtaking fresco of the Pantheon of Avendar,
portrayed standing in the clouds.  The High Room stretches away below you,
nearly a seventy foot drop down to the floor and its massive metal seal.

E
calaera~
A bold ch\@taren figure stands in bright, silvery armor, a mixture of
chain and plate but she stands as if it weighs nothing at all.  She is
painted in a moment of brief respite from battle; her full-face helmet
stands at her feet, and her sword of gleaming light is held low.  Beads of
sweat trickle down her golden face from her hairline, but an easy smile
stands out on her lips.  Her free hand stretches outward, reaching for
something that cannot be seen in the painting.  
~
E
vaialos~
Though the figure made out in hazy golden paint has no features to be
seen, the fresco can be showing none other than the lost god of the
ch\@taren, Vaialos.  Set on a murky, dark background, the golden figure
radiates a warmth out into the darkness, driving it further back simply by
being.  
~
E
elar~
Standing in the midst of a lush forest, a stout ethron woman is depicted
wearing layers of rough-spun cloth and leathers.  Caught midstride, she
moves with an athletic step that seems to not disturb the wildlife that
peers out of the trees at her.  Her face is long past youth, having softened
into a homey kind of roundness.  Her knowing gaze is focused on a small bird
that she cups in her hands.  Though it appears injured, both the curl of the
woman\@s fingers and the relaxed pose of the bird suggest all will soon be
well.  
~
E
jalassa~
A tall caladaran woman is painted standing in the midst of an austere,
almost ascetic room.  Her expression is severe but not unkind; the depiction
makes her look as though she is peering into your very soul and weighing it
against Her divine metric.  A simple monk\@s robe enfolds her willowy form,
but does not conceal the unusual strength visible in the set of her body. 
The hood obscures her hair, but the bark of her face is roughened with much
time; her cares obviously go to far less material concerns than that.  
~
E
enirra~
Enaerai the Balanced is painted as a plain woman, timeless and resolute. 
Neither old nor young, fair nor foul, her painted gaze is striking and
memorable.  Painted armored in a motley assortment of armor, her helm is
golden with one dark and one light horn.  A massive, heavy bow of gleaming
silver is painted in her hands, the arrow nocked within searing with immense
energy.  
~
E
rveyelhi~
Rveyelhi stands tall, his black robes draped loosely about his thin
shoulders.  Pale, wrinkled flesh stretches over his near-skeletal form, the
corpselike white of his skin offering stark contrast to his raiments.  His
pale hands hang at his sides, spilling from the sleeves of his robe, long
nimble fingers clutching at the air with a firm, yet oddly gentle grip. 
Rveyelhi\@s eyeless countenance is stern, wrinkled brow and thin downturned
lips giving an air of seeming disapproval.  A sharp, hawklike nose rises
from his face, giving a hint of something sinister.
~
E
serachel~
Serachel the Deceiver is painted as a tall, dark-skinned aelin with long
platinum hair.  Special detail has been given to his face, which is painted
as beautifully as mortal hands might craft.  Welcoming and inviting, almost
seductively so in his appeal, his stance draws you to the painting.  Grey-
green eyes are pictured with an intensity of personality, adding to the
fascinating pull which emanates from every facet of the figure.  
~
E
arkhural~
An uncharacteristically bulky shuddeni is painted here, swathed in
flowing robes of pitch black.  His visage is depicted as a mask of utter
savagery, cold and hateful.  His sharp mouth is set in a sneer, bladelike
nose wrinkled with disdain.  Dark blood trickles from his mouth and ears,
and the sky behind him seems to rain with blood as well.  
~
E
ashur~
Ashur, Dreadlord of the Void, is painted merely as a man-shaped shadow, a
humanoid rift in nothingness.  The air about him is painted with a sullen,
bruised look to it.  A vague, blood-red arc is slashed underneath where his
left eye would be.  The sky behind him is a pale wash of grey, drained of
vitality or energy.
~
E
chadraln~
Chadraln is painted as a caladaran man, tall of stature but with a slightly
gaunt, frail look.  His skin, rippled with shades of grey and pale bronze, is
roughly textured and marked with the wrinkles of age.  Grey eyes gaze out
from his face, above a softly tilted nose.  He is dressed plainly, wearing a
simple robe of light brown wool. The clouds upon which he stands are thin and
wispy, almost on the verge of being insubstantial, and the sky is a uniform,
colorless grey.
~
E
dolgrael~
Painted as a massive, fearsome human, Dolgrael the God of War seems
immensely powerful, cordlike sinews and rippling muscle showing in clear
relief beneath his tanned, weathered skin.  Piercing green eyes have been
painted with a hard, almost-but-not-quite cruel gleam to them, impassive
and hard.  His black hair is short, the raven hue matched in the midnight
trim which edges his silverly armor.
~
E
iandir~
Iandir, Crown of Law, is painted as a massive, leanly-muscled human
dressed in bulky, simple plate armor.  The symbol of the Guard is embossed
on his chestplate, a thick, short infantryman\@s sword painted in a leather
scabbard at his side.  His face is chiseled and intense, otherwise
unremarkable features possessing an immense sternness to them.  His hair is
dark and neat.  Painted against a bland blue sky, the clouds upon which he
stands are a steely grey.  
~
E
alajial~
A small caladaran girl is depicted sitting in a vast meadow of flowers,
the gleaming blue sky above her filling much of the upper half of the fresco
to make up for her lack of height.  She holds a single white lily in her
barky hands, face lowered just a bit as if she were caught mid-sniff.  Her
long, nut-brown hair has been tied away from her face with a curling white
ribbon that drifts up and away from her in a breeze.  Birds dance in the sky
around her, and a small mouse is depicted sniffing fearlessly at her knee.  
~
E
jolinn~
Clad in robes of glittering sapphire, the god Jolinn is a tall, powerful
human male.  Though his hair is a regal shade of silver, his face is smooth
and devoid of hair or wrinkle.  This odd timelessness seems to extend to the
sky behind him, a generic greyish-blue free of clouds.  His face is set in a
stern, impassive gaze, painted with the faintest hint of a smile.
~
E
aeolis~
Aeolis is painted as standing in a pool of light, the sky behind him a soft
grey streaked with the rosy harbingers of the rising sun.  Painted in his
mortal avatar, his aelin form is toned and muscular, light-blond hair and
vivid blue eyes complementing each other nicely.  An angelic smile is fixed
on his lips, his demeanor both somehow inviting and elegant.  Two majestic
wings of pure white arch from his back, tips glistening in the light.
~
E
rystaia~
This ch\@taren woman is painted against a backdrop of a gorgeous sunrise,
the sky fading through a glorious spectrum of colors.  The cloud on which
she stands seems afire with pure gold.  Her form is bathed in warm light,
golden skin shimmering and semitransparent.  Pure gold eyes without iris or
pupil are painted as beaming with their own illumination, and her long
golden hair flows about her form and merges with the cloud.  Her face is set
in a merry laugh, lips parted to show perfect pearly teeth.  
~
E
bayyal~
Bayyal, Lord of Flame and Hatred, is painted free and unbound in this
section of the fresco.  The sky behind him is a hellish red, the clouds
black with ash.  A shadow-black nefortu with blazing embers for eyes, he is
painted in the act of immolation, flames searing along his body yet
consuming nothing.
~
E
sythrak~
This srryn is painted with incredible, hulking muscles.  Dark flames
enwreathe his massive form, and the very sky behind him is a deep midnight
black, and the cloud beneath his feet is black and menacing.  Large,
blood-red eyes glare dangerously, and his scarred hide is pitch-black, the
scales thick and armored.  
~
E
tzajai~
Tzajai is painted as a small, androgynous nefortu, its pale brown,
hairless skin tough and leathery.  Painted with an odd translucency, the
clouds about its feet are a stormy, turbulent grey, laden with energy.  They
swirl up about the nefortu\@s knees, the illusion of movement painted
skillfully into the larger-than-life figure.  Large eyes of a stormy grey
are painted as sparking with electricity, and the doglike, nefortean head is
thrown back in a mad cackle.  The claw-tipped hands are spread wide in the
almost triumphant gesture.  
~
E
girikha~
A tall, grey kankoran woman is painted in a swirling column of air, the
cloud beneath her hovering, pawlike feet ruffled and stirring with the wind.
A deep brown stripe starts between her eyes and vanishes over the top of her
head, presumably continuing down her back.  Her eyes are the same vivid
bright-blue as the sky behind her.  Her doglike snout is painted in a wide,
feral snarl, and her ears are laid flat against her head.  A plain gown of
wooly grey material swathes her form.  
~
E
dome fresco pantheon~
This massive dome is the architectural crown to the vast, regal High Room
which is the center of the Library.  Over thirty feet in diameter, the
plaster interior has been painted with an enormous fresco of the Pantheon in
vivid color and detail.  Twenty-one large, godlike figures, each roughly
eighteen feet in height, loom around you in a circle.  Painted standing or
hovering in a circular bank of cloud which runs around the base of the dome,
each member of the Pantheon has been painted with meticulous precision and
attention to detail.  In no particular order, you see the paintings of
Jolinn, Sythrak, Bayyal, Chadraln, Tzajai, Girikha, Serachel, Iandir,
Dolgrael, Enirra, Rystaia, Calaera, Aeolis, Jalassa, Vaialos, Lilune, Elar,
Rveyelhi, Alajial, Arkhural, and Ashur.  
~
E
rune runed pillars~
These slender pillars are forged from enchanted steel and faced in
gleaming ochre enamel.  Earth runes of structure, immobility, and strength
are painted down their lengths in slashes of black enamel paint.  Between
the pillars, tall windows overlook the roofs of the Library and the city
outside.  
~
E
wide clerestory window windows bottom~
This wide clerestory is a full six feet tall, the space between the base
of the dome and the dome actual filled by tall windows and slender but
strong pillars.  The windows overlook the sloping, copper-clad roofs of the
Library and out into the streets of Earendam.  Were one to {Wlook out{n, one
might be able to scan the city.  
~
E
lilune~
Painted with her long, ink-black hair whirling around her, a woman stands
before a darkened city skyline.  It seems incomplete somehow, but it cannot
be told if the city behind her is being built or torn down.  Both Lunus and
Rhos shine from above, staining the backdrop and the woman with their
silver-and-red light.  The moons are reflected in the woman\@s odd-eyed gaze;
a silver halo shines from her grey right eye, while her crimson left sheds
bloody tears.  Her arms are caught lifting to the air; the rapturous
expression of her face makes the whole gesture an exaltation, though to what
is a mystery.

An Ancient Stone Stair~
This small room made entirely from hewn granite blocks is dominated by a
steeply-descending stone stair of the same material.  Blank but for the
stair and a lone tapestry, the room seems long-unused, dust accumulating in
wet piles in the corners.  The masonry is obviously ancient, fitted without
mortar.  Centuries of countless footsteps have worn a shallow depression in
the floor and stair, a smooth dip following the increasingly-crude stairs
into the depths.  A small, sturdy door opens to the east.

An Ancient Stone Stair~
This crude stone staircase is obviously very old; the steps are rough
granite, worn in the middle to a soft dip by the passage of countless feet. 
The walls are beaded with damp, the air chill and almost oppressively heavy
and still.  The stair burrows down through the raw stone walls in a vaguely
southerly direction, ascending to the north.  A small level area on the
stair, more a wide step than an actual landing, sits at the foot of a stout,
iron-plated and -studded door.  No handle or lock is visible on the blank
face.

Astadlari\@s Study~
This study is cluttered with a fascinating array of items.  The wide desk
which covers the west and north walls is itself buried under mounds of paper
and books.  A wooden display case hangs drunkenly on the southern wall, and
a threadbare rug covers the worn stone floor.  An odd, oval bulb of glass
hangs in one corner, its surface etched with a curved map of Avendar. 
Feathers of all sizes and colors are affixed to the eastern wall with globs
of resin.  An astrolabe and sextant gather dust on a high shelf, and bits of
clockwork and gears can be seen scattered about.  A wire bin filled with
clumps of dusty, muddy rocks squats in the southwest corner, and what seems
to be a large, crude drawing of a druid mid-transformation is glued above
the desk.  A plain wooden door opens to the east.

The North Wing~
The north wing of the vast Grand Library stretches away to the north and
south between tall stacks of shelves built from dark wood.  Books press in
on both sides, of all imaginable sizes, materials, and colors.  The
twenty-foot ceiling ends above your head in a curving barrel-vault of pale
stone.  Iron wheeled ladders run across the faces of the shelves on oiled
metal tracks, allowing access to the more distant shelves.  The wing
continues to the north.  To the south, the ceiling suddenly opens high and
leaps out of sight as the north wing opens onto the massive High Room.  The
air is quiet, heavy, and cool, filled with the dusty smells of age and
parchment.

An Ancient Stone Stair~
This ancient stone stairway wends its rough way down into the raw stone
here, becoming more and more natural as it descends.  At the very bottom a
sheer rock wall blocks the path, the natural granite black and imposing in
its sturdiness.  The stone glitters with damp, and the air is wet and chill.
The stairs ascend in a vaguely northerly direction.

An Empty, Old Room~
This rough stone room is built entirely from ancient granite.  Dank and
dark, it has the distinct, untouched air of an abandoned dungeon.  A lone
sconce of corroded iron is mounted by the iron-studded door, empty. 
Otherwise completely vacant, the only thing in the room is a few small
shards of greyish stone.  A shallow stairway starts in the center of the
room, the steps descending through the floor to a dark doorway low in the
eastern wall.

An Ancient Stone Chamber~
This ancient stone chamber deep in the solid foundations of the massive
Grand Library of Earendam has been built as a great archive.  The room is
bone-chillingly cold and dry, stretching away to the east, west, and north. 
Rough stone walls, floor, and ceiling are built from large blocks of crude
granite.  Rows of smooth marble columns fill the long room, humming with
warding magics and protective spells.  Containing all the original documents
from which copies are made for the Library above, the thin air seems charged
from the sheer amount of energy spent to protect and preserve these
documents.

An Ancient Stone Chamber~
This ancient stone chamber deep in the solid foundations of the massive
Grand Library of Earendam has been built as a great archive.  The room is
bone-chillingly cold and dry, stretching away to the west and south.  Rough
stone walls, floor, and ceiling are built from large blocks of crude
granite.  Rows of smooth marble columns fill the long room, humming with
warding magics and protective spells.  Containing all the original documents
from which copies are made for the Library above, the thin air seems charged
from the sheer amount of energy spent to protect and preserve these
documents.  A small, low archway leads out of the room to the east.

A Rough Stone Passage~
This ancient stone passage deep in the solid foundations of the massive
Grand Library of Earendam runs into darkness to the north, and ducks under a
low stone lintel to join a long chamber to the west.  Rough stone walls,
floor, and ceiling are built from large blocks of crude granite.  The air is
cold and still, laden with dust.  The passage is quite narrow, but over ten
feet tall.

A Square Stone Chamber~
This square stone chamber is chillingly cold and dark, the rough stone
walls coarse and unworn by the centuries.  The smell of dust is chokingly
heavy in the air, the air stagnant and dry.  The low ceiling is made from
pebbled mortar.  An imposing stone door sits in the southern wall, a small
keyhole visible in the center.

A Rough Stone Passage~
This ancient stone passage deep in the solid foundations of the massive
Grand Library of Earendam runs into darkness to the south, climbs a steep,
ladderlike stair to the northeast.  Rough stone walls, floor, and ceiling
are built from large blocks of crude granite, which slowly gives way to
coarse, pumice-like black stone.  The air is cold and still, laden with
dust.  The passage is quite narrow, but over ten feet tall, the aged masonry
unworn by the centuries.

The Library Dormitory~
This ovoid room is walled in chalky white limestone.  A dark stone floor
is covered with a thick, if worn, rug of coarse Ashta Harrud wool.  Bunk
beds line the walls, the headboards against the wall and the footboards all
pointing towards the center of the room.  Small, lidless foot lockers sit
underneath each bed.  A small brazier sits in the center of the room, bolted
carefully to the floor.  A simple wooden door leads east.

The Forbidden Bookroom~
This roughly-hexagonal chamber is built from ancient, dark stone blocks,
the coarse, granular rock stark and imposing.  The room is dark, the walls
tapering towards each other as they near the oddly curved ceiling.  The air
is numbingly cold and dry, tingling with magical energy.  Six low pedestals
of the same porous stone sit in a vague hexagonal arrangement, each with a
rectangular depression in the top.  A niche-like shelf in the southern wall
seems designed to hold books as well.  An imposing stone door sits in the
northern wall, a small keyhole visible in the center.  The room is permeated
by some half-light, the source unknown.
