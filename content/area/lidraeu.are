Cyaed~
Cyaed Drathar the keeper of the lighthouse stands here.
~
Cyaed Drathar, the lighthouse keeper, is a tall, broad shouldered man,
whose face and hands are reddened from years of work by the sea.  His life
has been devoted not only to the upkeep of this lighthouse, but to the
construction of the Gaald docks and the study of the arts of battle.

{y  ==================={x
         Chapter {rFour{x
{r{x
  The following is all that was recovered from a young human trainee\@s log
book, preserved, miraculously, to this day. The following list and 
discussion contains all the knowledge that the young trainee in question
was absorbing from a master student. Be warned, fire does not only burn
wood and parchment.
{r{x
  {rLesson One, Lyrenday, 22nd of the Sundering{x
    In the carefully prepared words of the master:
    {r{x
      \#The incendiary path is the one true path. In nature, does not
    the flame consume all? The forests are hungrily devoured, the plains,
    reduced to ashes. How misguided one must be to be a practitioner of
    another craft. Only the water can stop the fire, therefore, one asks,
    how could fire be stronger? Water cannot level forests, water cannot
    turn a fertile plain into a barren wasteland. Thus, once the flame
    catches, it will never stop, until all is consumed.\#
    {r{x
  {r{x
  {rLesson Two, Lyrenday, 29th of the Sundering{x
    Today, I first dabbled in the arts of the Inner Fire. Up to now,
    my only training in the flames that consume the world. Now, my focus
    shifts to the flames that burn in the heart, the flames that burn 
    long on the soul, the lusts. Master, quite correctly, states that
    only when one\@s soul is ablaze, can one walk through the inferno,
    and return unscathed.
  {r{x
  {rLesson Three, Lyrenday, 36th of the Sundering{x
    Never before have I been witness to such power, save for the prescence
    of our Lord Ssanthal. Master has indicated that not only must world,
    body, and soul be aflame, but the mind as well. It came to pass that
    my mind transcended the physical flames, to the chaotic energies of
    the world. I find myself becoming ever more like the flames every day.
    {x{r{x

{R  Caal\@s Fall{x
{y  ==========={x
  Chapter {rTwo{x
{r{x
  After leading the srryn for, presumably, quite a long time, Ssanthal
turned his gaze towards the mighty northern nation of Caal. From the
few scorched documents which survived his attack, and were subsequently
stored and studied by a monastic order for thousands of years, the 
destruction of Caal had been quick and ruthless. While srryn purists 
believe he incinerated Caal with a single thought, testimony from the
few survivors not driven mad paint a far more brutal picture. 
  An excerpt from a scroll scribed by a monk who was healing a particularly
wounded survivor of the Caal army:
{r{x{y
    \#I was watching the countryside from atop the battlements, when 
   suddenly, the ground did shake and buckle. Pillars of flame, aye,
   lifted from the ground. Mighty they were, and our outer wall fell.
   Then the armies came, the srryn, thousands of them, swarming over 
   everything, snuffing out the light...\#
{x{r{x
  After the intense destruction, the name of Ssanthal would never be 
forgotten by all who descended from the great nation.

           Chapter {rOne{x
{r{x
  Little is known of the early years of the one known as the Firebrand of
Sythtys, Ssanthal.  Srryn legends to this day tell that he was born from
a magma spewing hole in the earth, in a furious storm of flame and brimstone.
This is as good a story as any, considering the immense powers he possessed.
  From a young age, he showed extraordinary skill molding the flames to his
will. Ruthlessly, he slew his own masters, and whoever stood in his way.
Despite his immense power, he was suprisingly benevolent, to what extent
a srryn can be. Perhaps his mind had some greater lucid element to it, which
gave him such control. He had the rage of the most brutal srryn, but the 
intellect of a cunning aelin. In all likelyhood, he was aware that not
even he could contain the unending bloodlust of the entire srryn race.
Thus, the Firebrand of Sythtys was known and feared throughout the land.

{R  Fire\@s Contained{x
{y  ================{x
     Chapter {rThree{x
{r{x
  While information from the era has generally been lost with time, the 
scarce few surviving documents indicate a great fear across the land at
the mention of the name Ssanthal. No one believed that his fury could
be contained. He razed city after city in his unrelenting fury. However,
impossibility is a chain that binds only those who can afford it.
  Eventually, as scrolls from their own order tell us, the ancient aelin
monks at the Monastery at Caein\@Mar took it upon themselves to deliver 
the world from Ssanthal\@s might. Wielding the fully awakened power of the
shards of the Seas, they sought battle with the srryn. A long battle 
ensued, obliterating the surrounding countryside. 
  Even with their stalwart determination and mythic weaponry, they were
unable to extinguish the flame of Ssanthal. Therefore, they wove a spell
that would, while not returning Ssanthal to the Astral Plane, would imprison
him in eternal stone, forever a prisoner with his immense power. It came
to pass that Ssanthal\@s prison was to be cast into the depths of the ocean,
that he might never escape, and once again wreak havoc across Avendar.

{r{x
  This text is a compilation of various scrolls and books surviving the
War of Fire. I, the scribe, have been recruited to create this text 
for the srryn, who seek to regain the power lost to them so long ago.
In exchange for my services, the srryn will eliminate the nuisance of 
Earendam for I and my estate. Or, so they wish to think. As planned, they
will be slaughtered, and I shall walk away with the greatest tome of 
knowledge ever written. I shall hold true power. The srryn are such weak 
minded fools.

{y                              Eulaedil Aeliphos, aelin scribe
                              Thethelsday, 10th of Kyanamir
{x                        
  A line of dried blood mixed with small feather pieces is smeared over
the name of Eulaedil, a large claw scratch running parallel to it.

Path by a Rocky Ocean Shore~
A sandy ocean shore stretches to the north and south, surrounding the
beaten path that travels parallel to the shoreline a ways to the west.  Few
if any remnants of the thick oak forests to the northeast remain, replaced
instead by pebbles, shale, and fallen boulders from the towering, horizon
dominating, Yagash mountains far to the east.  To the southwest, a small
peninsula juts forth from the now darker sands of the shoreline, and a small
town sits atop it.  The path below is deeply grooved and spotted with tracks
of animals, people, and caravans of goods, and stretches to the north and
south.

A Rocky Ocean Shore~
A dark sanded shoreline stretches far to the north, interspersed with
small pebbles and rocks.  Small plants thrive on the damp surfaces of the
larger rocks, imbuing them with a green hue.  The choppy, windwhipped ocean
to the west is dominated, close to the shoreline, with a few large rocks
that jut forth from it, and a number of smaller rocks with worn edges.  The
waves crash around the rocks, creating an uneven water pattern in the sand. 
To the east, a beaten path runs parallel to the shoreline, while far to the
east the Yagash Mountains dominate the horizon.  To the south, a small
peninsula forms from the coastline, the sand upon its beaches being darker
still.  A path runs east and west along the peninsula to the south,
providing access to a small town on the peninsula.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
Dark rocks protrude forth from the ankle deep grey waters of the Sea of
Lidraeu, providing obstructions for the waves to crash against.  Sea spray
fills the air around the rocks, as well as the stench of fungi on the rocks,
and dead sea creatures caught in the numerous tidepools formed in the area. 
To the east, a fairly dark sanded beach begins, stretching far to the
northeast.  Beyond that, a small beaten path runs parallel to the shoreline.
The Yagash Mountains far to the east are still visible, filling the horizon
with their dark form.  To the south, a number of tremendous rocks block the
path to a small peninsula beyond them.  To the west, the grey waters
continue.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
An grey slate of unabated churning waters stretches throughout the area,
and continues most prominently to the north.  The mighty dark rocks that
interrupted the waves crashing eastward are no longer present, and the
barely visible sea floor is now a rolling plain of sand.  Far off to the
east, a fairly dark sanded beach begins, stretching far to the northeast. 
The Yagash Mountains, a tremendous distance to the east are still barely
visible, interrupting the horizon with their dark form.  To the south, a
number of tremendous rocks block the path to a small peninsula beyond them. 
To the west, a small, sandy island pokes above the waves, and a tall stone
lighthouse stands firm upon it.

In a Lighthouse~
A thick, sturdy wooden framework helps support the stone and mortar walls
that encircle the lighthouse.  Each stone is carved of lightly colored
granite, and is held fast with mortar.  The floor is merely a series of worn
boards that obscure the sand of the island beneath the lighthouse.  Through
the arch to the east, sea spray and cool ocean air flow unabated.  A small
window on the western wall, framed in wood, allows the Sea of Lidraeu to be
seen.  A wooden ladder leads upward, through the tall lighthouse.

Top of a Lighthouse~
The large, circular, stone ceiling of this open room is supported by thin
granite columns, creating large windows in all directions, allowing for
light to pass through.  A large pit in the center of the room serves to hold
the massive flames that provide the light that the building is designed to
issue across the surrounding ocean.  Sea air blows rapidly through the open
room, cooling it significantly.  A ladder leads down, to the rest of the
lighthouse.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
Dark rocks protrude forth from the ankle deep grey waters of the Sea of
Lidraeu, providing obstructions for the waves to crash against.  Sea spray
fills the air around the rocks, as well as the stench of fungi on the rocks,
and dead sea creatures caught in the numerous tidepools formed in the area. 
To the east, a fair sanded beach begins, stretching far to the northeast. 
Beyond that, a small beaten path runs parallel to the shoreline.  The Yagash
Mountains far to the east are still visible, filling the horizon with their
dark form.  The grey waters continue to the north, west, and south.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
A grey slate of unabated churning waters stretches throughout the area,
and continues most prominently to the north and west.  The mighty dark rocks
that interrupted the waves crashing eastward are no longer present, and the
barely visible sea floor is now a rolling plain of sand.  Far off to the
east, a fairly dark sanded beach begins, stretching far to the northeast,
while closer east, the ocean continues, though much shallower.  The Yagash
Mountains, a tremendous distance to the east are still barely visible,
interrupting the horizon with their dark form.

Path by a Rocky Ocean Shore~
A sandy ocean shore stretches to the north and south, surrounding the
beaten path that travels parallel to the shoreline a ways to the west.  Few
if any remnants of the thick oak forests to the northeast remain, replaced
instead by pebbles, shale, and fallen boulders from the towering Yagash
mountains far to the east.  Far off to the southwest, a small peninsula juts
forth from the shoreline, and a small town sits atop it.  The path below is
deeply grooved and spotted with tracks of animals, people, and caravans of
goods, and stretches to the north and south.

Path by a Wooded Ocean Shore~
A sandy ocean shore stretches to the north and south, surrounding the
beaten path that travels parallel to the shoreline, which, to the north,
curves eastward slightly, a ways to the west.  A few small shrubs and
grasses stray from the oak forest to the east, their leaves rustling in the
gentle oceanside winds.  Waves crash in the distance westward, depositing
yet more pale sand upon the beaches.  The path is deeply grooved and spotted
with tracks of animals, people, and caravans of goods, and stretches both to
the north, where the forest grows far thicker, as well as the south.

A Wooded Ocean Shore~
A sandy ocean shore, flat and uninterrupted to the south, curves
eastward here, interspersed with small shrubs, as well as pebbles and
diminutive rocks.  Small fungal plants thrive on the damp surfaces of the
rocks, imbuing them with a green hue.  The choppy, windwhipped ocean
spanning western and northern horizons is dominated, close to the shoreline,
with a few large rocks that jut forth from it, and a number of smaller rocks
with worn edges.  The waves crash around the rocks, creating an uneven water
pattern in the sand.  To the east, a beaten path runs parallel to the
shoreline through the more wooded parts of the beach, while far to the east
the great forests of Qilarn dominate the land.  To the northeast, few or no
rocks interrupt the peaceful waves of the ocean.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
Rocks protrude forth from the ankle deep grey waters of the Sea of
Lidraeu, providing obstructions for the waves to crash against.  Sea spray
fills the air around the rocks, as well as the stench of fungi on the rocks,
and dead sea creatures caught in the numerous tidepools formed in the area. 
To the east, a fair sanded beach curves eastward, then stretches far to the
north.  Beyond that, a small beaten path runs parallel to the shoreline. 
The Yagash Mountains far to the east are still visible, filling the horizon
with their dark form.  The grey waters continue to the north, west, and
south.

the ocean floor becoming not only less rocky, but less visible as well.  The
ocean continues, also, to the north, south, and east.  To the northwest, the
ocean floor drops off drastically, and the waters become extremely violent,
waves churning and crashing into each other, spraying water into the air.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
A grey slate of unabated churning waters stretches throughout the area,
and continues most prominently to the west.  The mighty dark rocks that
interrupted the waves crashing eastward are no longer present, and the
barely visible sea floor is now a rolling plain of sand.  Far off to the
east, a pale sanded beach begins, stretching far to the northeast, while
closer east, the ocean continues, though much shallower.  The Yagash
Mountains, a tremendous distance to the east are still barely visible,
interrupting the horizon with their dark form.  To the north, the sea floor
drops off tremendously, making the waters violent, with layer after layer of
tall, powerful waves crashing down upon one another, and swirling about,
spraying water into the sky.

A sandy ocean shore stretches to the north and south, dotted with
shrubbery and occasional stands of trees.  A well-travelled dirt road winds
its way between the shoreline and the trees of Qilarn, running north and

in the wind, the leaves rustling quietly on the branches.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
A grey slate of unabated churning waters stretches throughout the area,
and continues in all directions.  The ocean floor has dropped off greatly,
and is now far beneath the rolling waves of the surface, its sandy surface
now invisible.  Far to the west the ocean floor drops off farther yet, the
waters become violent, with layer after layer of tall, powerful waves
crashing down upon one another, and swirling about, spraying water into the
sky.

A Wooded Ocean Shore~
A sandy ocean shore stretches to the north and south, dotted with
shrubbery and occasional stands of trees.  A well-travelled dirt road winds
its way between the shoreline and the trees of Qilarn, running east into the
woods, and south.  Waves lap at the beach, and a brisk wind stirs the sand
among the fallen branches and leaves.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
The ocean floor here consists of numerous small hills of rolling sand,
interspersed with tiny rocks and shells.  Powerful winds far at sea carry
mighty waves unabated to the shore directly eastward.  A powerful undertoe
pulls out from the shoreline, which stretches far to the north and south,
stirring sand from the floor of the ankle deep ocean water.  A large oak
forest is slightly visible far to the east, the forest of Qilarn.  The ocean
continues to the north, west, and south, foam capped waves churning across
the grey waters.

The ocean floor beneath the waves here changes abruptly, no longer

powerful winds far at sea carry mighty waves unabated to the shore eastward.
A powerful undertow pulls out from the shoreline eastward, which stretches

A Marshy Island~
A marshy island rises atop the waves here, covered with thick, tall grass
and small stands of large reeds.  Waves, having been weakened by the gentle
upward slope of the seafloor west of the island, sift through the tall
grasses, leaving slats of foam on the island surface, merely a soaked
mixture of sand and mud.  A few small shrubs bearing miniscule dark fruits
also mysteriously grow in the weak soil.  The small island continues to the
north for a time, then ends, while in all other directions, the churning
grey waters of the sea continue.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
The rolling sands of the ocean floor beneath the waves here begin to
roughen, caused by the eastward rise in the sea floor to the windy cliffs
and bluffs northeastward.  The powerful winds far at sea carry mighty waves
unabated to the shore eastward.  A powerful undertow pulls out from the
shoreline eastward, which stretches far to the north and southeast, stirring
sand from the floor of the waist deep ocean water.  A large oak forest is
slightly visible far to the east, the forest of Qilarn.  The ocean continues
to the north, west, south, and east, foam capped waves churning across the
grey waters.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
A grey slate of unabated churning waters stretches throughout the area,
and continues in all directions.  The ocean floor has dropped off greatly,
and is now far beneath the rolling waves of the surface, its sandy surface
now invisible.  Far to the west the ocean floor drops off farther yet, the
waters become violent, with layer after layer of tall, powerful waves
crashing down upon one another, and swirling about, spraying water into the
sky.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
The ocean floor here consists of numerous small hills of rolling sand,
interspersed with tiny rocks and shells.  Powerful winds far at sea carry
mighty waves unabated to the shore directly eastward.  A powerful undertoe
pulls out from the shoreline, which stretches far to the south, stirring
sand from the floor of the ankle deep ocean water.  A large oak forest is
slightly visible far to the east, the forest of Qilarn.  The ocean continues
to the north, west, and south, foam capped waves churning across the grey
waters.  Mighty cliffs rise from the shoreline to the northeast, waves
pounding soundly against them.

By the Seaside Cliffs~
The water here is slightly shallower than to the south as the sea floor
rises slightly to the northeast, where tall cliffs stand, waves crashing
mightily against them.  The faces of the cliffs are worn with the endless
battering of wind and wave, and are dashed with crevices, including a
particularly large one.  A number of the bluffs appear poised to collapse at
any time, and crash into the sea.  A few large rocks lie cracked and
battered at the foot of the cliffs.  The cliffs continue to the west and
south.  The ocean itself stretches seemingly endlessly to the south and
west, churning with the wind.

Far to the east, powerful cliffs rise from the sea, and the mighty waves
that surge across the grey waters crash loudly upon them.  North of these
cliffs, a white sanded beach begins, and stretches northward.  To the north
and east, the ocean continues, relatively calmly, while to the south and
west, it becomes extremely wiolent, the waves becoming superfluously large
and powerful.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
The powerful winds far at sea carry mighty waves unabated to the shore
far to the east.  A powerful undertow pulls out from the steep, white
shoreline, which stretches far to the north and southeast, stirring sand
from the floor of the deep ocean water.  A large forest is slightly visible
far to the east, far over the rippled sands of the beach.  The ocean
continues to the north, west, south, and east, foam capped waves churning
across grey waters.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
The powerful winds far at sea carry mighty waves unabated to the shore
barely visible, a distance to the east.  A powerful undertow pulls out from
the steep, white shoreline, which stretches far to the north and south,
stirring sand from the floor of the deep ocean water.  The smell of salt and
sea drifts through the air, as the migthy currents sift sea spray through
the air.  The ocean continues to the north, west, south, and east, foam
capped waves churning across grey waters.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
A slate of churning waters stretches throughout the area, and continues
to the east, north, and south.  The ocean floor has dropped off greatly from
that of the south and east, and is now far beneath the rolling waves of the
surface, intangible.  To the west, the ocean floor drops off farther yet,
the waters become violent, wave after wave pounding upon one another,
issuing forth a furious sound and spectacle.

By a Ocean Beach~
The ocean floor here appears far deeper than waters by a coastline are
normally, as the cliffs far to the southeast seem to have torn the land up
with them, leaving some rock exposed beneath the water.  The powerful winds
far at sea carry mighty waves unabated to the sandy shores eastward,
crashing on the white sand.  Far to the east, a large tea forest is visible
over the slope of the wind-rippled sands.  The ocean continues in all other
directions, being stirred by the westerly winds.

The powerful winds far at sea carry mighty waves unabated to the shore
eastward.  A powerful undertow pulls out from the steep, white shoreline,
which stretches far to the north and southeast, stirring sand from the floor
of the deep ocean water.  A large forest is slightly visible far to the
east, far over the rippled sands of the beach.  The ocean continues to the
north, west, south, and east, foam capped waves churning across grey waters.

The vast grey ocean waters stretch unending into the distance in all

forth a resounding roar.  The drenched air smells of salt, and the cool
westerly winds carry the scent eastward.  Strong undercurrents pull seaweed,
driftwood, and shell fragments from the far distant ocean floor to the
water\@s surface.

On the Sea of Lidraeu~
The vast grey ocean waters stretch unending into the distance in all
directions.  Wave after mighty wave break and crash upon each other, issuing
forth a resounding roar.  The drenched air smells of salt, and the cool
westerly winds carry the scent eastward.  Strong undercurrents pull seaweed,
driftwood, and shell fragments from the far distant ocean floor to the

A Dark Tunnel~
A small, rocky tunnel cuts through the rock, cloaked in darkness and
dank.  The crashing of mighty waves on the jagged rocks of the cliffs that
surround can be heard, and sea salt can be smelled, wafting through from the
west.  A faint light is visible far to the east, and the narrow tunnel
continues that way.  The very bottom of the tunnel is worn smooth, and
appears lighter than the surrounding rock.

A Dark Tunnel~
A small, rocky tunnel cuts through the rock, cloaked in darkness and
dank.  The crashing of mighty waves on the jagged rocks of the cliffs that
surround can be heard, and sea salt can be faintly smelled, wafting through
from the far west.  A faint light is visible from between the rips in a
soiled cloth that hangs down from the ceiling eastward.  The very bottom of
the tunnel is worn smooth, and appears lighter than the surrounding rock.

A Large Cave~
A large cave sprawls out from the narrow tunnel westward, walls and
ceiling carved of jagged rocks.  The large cave continues to the north and
south, the smell of burning meat wafting through the area.  A large soiled
cloth hangs from the ceiling to the west, covering a narrow tunnel.

A Large Cave~
A large cave, its walls covered in jagged rocks stretches far to the
south.  The faint scents of charred meat, smoke, and brimstone drift through
the area.  Worn from endless use, the rocks of the cavern floor are a much
lighter color than those of the rest of the cave.  A narrow tunnel begins to
the east, behind a tattered cloth.  A shredded cloth to the north blocks the
entryway to yet another part of the cave.

A Cooking Pit~
The cave floor drops suddenly here, into a deep pit.  Large strings are
strung across the pit, tied around sharp rocks, and the smell of cooking
meat and ashes fills the air, as does a smoky haze.  Over a ridge to the
north, the large cavern continues, drawing smoke and vapors out of the hazy
pit.

End of a Narrow Tunnel~
A small, rocky tunnel cuts through the rock, cloaked in darkness and
dank.  The smell of sweat and mold dominates the air within the narrow
tunnel which ends in a curved bowl shape immediately to the east, chipped
and cracked.  The tunnel, whose bottom is worn smooth, and lighter than the
surrounding rock, continues to the west.

A Sandy Island~
A small, fair sanded island rises up from beneath the choppy,
wind-whipped Sea of Lidraeu.  Cold, grey waters stretch endlessly to the
north, and east, while to the south, tremendous rocks obscure passage to a
small peninsula that juts forth from the coastline.  The ocean becomes
violent to the northwest, large waves crashing down upon one another.  A
tall stone lighthouse stands to the west, while the fair sands of the island
closely skirt the lighthouse edges.

A Large Cave Expanse~
A large expanse of cavern opens here, sparsely decorated with various
items of furniture.  The jagged rocks of the walls are worn down
significantly, and some chipped and carved into graceful statues.  A large
shredded cloth hanging from the ceiling to the south disguises the entryway
to the main body of the cave.  Brightly burning torches are mounted above
tall bookshelves that line the walls, pouring light out across the expanse
of the cavern.  A tattered fur rug garnishes the floor by the entryway.

A Narrow Tunnel~
A small, rocky tunnel cuts through the rock, cloaked in darkness and

the rips in a tattered cloth that hangs down from the ceiling westward.  The
very bottom of the tunnel is worn smooth, and appears lighter than the
surrounding rock.
