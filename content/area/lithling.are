A wild arec grazes here.
~
The arecs of Lithling are tall, sturdy creatures with powerfully-muscled
bodies and long, thick necks.  Elegantly-jointed legs carry them along the
ground when they choose to move, cantering about with surprising grace. 
Their hides, though predominantly a tawny brown, are striped with uneven
lines of dappled green.  The tranquil beasts are usually content to stand
ruminating, lowing occasionally.

A cottonmouth snake slithers here.
~
A dark, faintly banded snake about two and a half feet long slithers
through the undergrowth.  It constantly swings its head this way and that,
tasting the air with a pale white tongue as it surveys its surroundings with
beady black eyes.  The wide body of the snake enables it to float easily on
the surface of water.

A peasant laborer is here, working in the fields.
~
The peasants of Lithling are a hardy, broad-backed race, tending towards
a certain stoutness of build.  Wide, sun-browned faces are the norm, along
with uniformly dark hair and eyes.  Though tough and callused, they seem not
unfriendly.

An ethron peasant is hard at work in the fields.
~
Over the years, some of the ethron native to the vale gradually
assimilated into the population of human settlers from Earendam.  Never
terribly numerous, they are not especially common among the plantation
workers.  They go about their labors with a cheerful but distantly resigned
expression on their dark green faces.

stout ethron matron~
an ethron matron~
A stout, matronly ethron is here, tending to the domestic tasks of the camp.
~
The skin of this ethron woman is a deeper, cooler green than is typical
for those from other parts of the world.  Her middle-aged body has been
toughened and shaped by the hard wilderness life into a stout, round form, a
pillar of support for the young children milling about.  Her face is wide
and somewhat flat, with black-brown eyes gazing about in an expression of
innocent wonder tinged with a faint undercurrent of mistrust.

An ethron child plays here.
~
This tiny ethron child can\@t be much more than five years old.  Barefoot,
it is clad only in a dirty, patched smock of animal hides.  Its skin is the
characteristic dark green of the native Lithling ethron, its wide eyes the
same deep, opaque brown.  Its bare head is covered with thick curls of
short, dark hair.

and a half feet tall.  On furlough from the eastern wars, he visits with his
family and the young ladies of the surrounding plantations, bringing his
charming smile and striking features wherever he goes.  Though his
expression lacks gravity, his comrades in arms know him as a cunning
officer, more than once saving whole companies from annihilation by
marauding srryn at the border.  On duty, he wields the sword of his
ancestors, doing every justice to the storied name it bears.

The wife of Banlad Houle, the stately Zylenea has only just begun to show

The second of the Brothers Houle, Pallo is shorter in stature than the
rest of his family, his features conforming more closely to those of his
mother.  He spent his youth at school in Earendam, and as a result adheres
to a different standard of fashion: his beard, in particular, is trimmed
after the manner of that city, in contrast to the people around him.  A
skilled accountant, he attends to the financial side of the family business.
He is also an accomplished amateur musician, with the long, dextrous fingers
of a trained harpsichordist.

Wuhen, the reclusive fourth son of Banlad Houle, spends most of his time
in his laboratory, examining plants and animals brought to him from outside.
His watery grey eyes have a peculiar sort of intensity, not at all in
keeping with his shy bearing.  Slight of build, he walks with the hunched
posture of one who spends the majority of his time hunched over in deep
concentration.  Though somewhat overawed by his father, he is an

Tenlos and Uvitar, the inseparable twins, are the last-born of the six
Houle brothers.  Wiry, tall, and identical, they spend their days out in the
fields, overseeing the labor of planting, harvesting, and processing the
sugarcane crops.  Occasionally this means getting rough with a thief or

Kinia Penlop was widowed by a lightning strike the morning after her

intelligence to return the business to prominence, though the Penlop name
will not outlast her and her daughter.  Not yet quite forty, she is still
strikingly attractive, her years of hard work and meticulous calculation
having given her fair face and green eyes a lean, tempered beauty.

Jaags elderly aelin butler~
Jaags~
An elderly aelin majordomo makes his silent, dignified way through the manor.
~
This ancient aelin has served generations of Penlops, rising steadily to
his current position over the course of decades.  The family was always
beset by terrible misfortunes, with only a few heads of the household dying
at anything like old age.  Jaags has seen all manner of accidents and
illnesses strike his masters, and knows the line will end when his mistress
dies and Gesska marries.  More than anyone else except the Widow herself,
Jaags was responsible for the survival of the estate over the last twenty
years, and is resolved to serve out the rest of his days as best he can, in
valediction.

The elfin Gesska moves about with ethereal grace.

Twenty years old, Gesska Penlop is positively gorgeous.  Long, braided
tresses of black hair frame her pale face, setting off dark red lips.  Her
eyes are particularly lovely, colored a shifting mix of green, blue, and
grey, and containing a depth of experience very rare in one of her age. 
With the untimely death of her father before her birth, she had to grow up
learning to assist her mother in managing the family plantations.  As the
only heiress to the estate, she is constantly sought by suitors of every
description.

Valdamien Benedar man fat~
Valdamien Benedar~
An enormously fat man lies on the bed.
~
A corpulent, choleric-looking man, Valdamien Benedar reclines in his
heirloom bed, from which he directs the running of his vineyards.  A
latecomer to the Lithling community, he acquired the vineyards from the
previous owner by purchase rather than the customary inheritance, which is a
source of no little friction with the other families, who consider him an
upstart bourgeouis.  Heedless of their disapproval, he forges ahead in his
ruthless way, making the Benedar vineyards among the most fruitful in
Avendar.

A stocky, scarred ethron is here.
~
Sold into slavery at a young age, Tanemem literally fought his way to
prominence as a gladiator, where he caught the eye of Valdamien Benedar
during a business trip to Ashta Harrud.  Benedar purchased the cunning
fighter, granting him his freedom upon completion of ten years\@ indentured
servitude as a bodyguard.  After finishing his term of service, Tanemem
remained on Benedar\@s payroll and has since proved a valuable asset, not
least in training young Feynroth.

Feynroth~
A graceful youth practices sword forms.
~
Only son and heir to Valdamien Benedar, Feynrat is being groomed by his
father to succeed him, not least out of the faint hope that he will be more
fully accepted than Valdamien by the other planting dynasties.  A bright and
diligent young man, he has the lithe, slender build of a trained fencer, and
the sallow complexion of one who has done most of his practicing indoors. 
His lip is permanently curled into a faint sneer, and his height seems to
serve primarily to allow his dark brown eyes to look down imperiously upon
those around him.

Sennat~
A pale-skinned caladaran is here.
~
This caladaran has been a retainer of Valdamien Benedar since the old
days in the Var Bandor mercantile establishment, where he aided the human in
amassing a fortune large enough to purchase the Lithling vineyards from the
bored scion of the Mercene family.  A shrewd predictor of market trends,
Sennat was slightly out of his depth in the business of managing a vineyard,
but has learned quickly, and is now at least competent to ensure that the
crop is bountiful and harvested on time.

A peregrine falcon perches here, flexing its wings.

The upper portion of this bird is covered with dark feathers, stretching
the length of its almost-four-foot wingspan.  Its underbelly is softened by
lighter, speckled plumage.  A set of sharp yellow talons and a hooked beak
make up its weapons, and large, hungry eyes complete the image of a true
predator.

out of concern for the inheritance to which Ulien would never be entitled. 
Passed over and slighted by all, bitterness and self-pity ate away at her

An elegant, sharp-featured lady is here.
~
Qilse Renden, first-born daughter of Zagaman Lethet, has an almost
peculiarly angular face, upon which the lines of middle age have begun to
encroach, bestowing a markedly chiseled though not displeasing look.  She
was just old enough to understand the customs of primogeniture when her
brother was born, and has never tried terribly hard to mask her disapproval
of his lack of interest in the family business.  Married now to a wealthy
merchant and with a family of her own, she has resigned herself to her fate,
though she still resents Pendorf\@s laziness.

look.

A Bridge Across the Stream~
A bridge stretches across the broad, slow Lithling Stream, connecting the
western freehold to the valley proper.  The bridge itself is made of wooden
planks, cunningly lashed together into a sturdy construction, well able to
endure the foot traffic to which it is typically subjected.  To the west,
the terrain opens out onto rocky downlands, descending into the fertile
Lithling Valley to the east.

A Marshy Riverbank~
Close by, the Lithling Stream meanders its leisurely way from the Arien
Plains south to the sea.  A wide, silty river, it has given rise to broad
strips of thick marsh on both its banks, full of reeds and cattails.  To the
east, the terrain becomes firmer as it descends into Lithling Valley, while
the stream is spanned by a bridge to the west.

An Open Meadow~
The northern edge of the Vale has been left largely uncultivated, leaving
plenty of open space for wild flora and fauna to thrive.  This grassy
meadow, nestled near the Dantaron where the Lithling Stream splits from it,
is full of lush grass, replete with the sounds of field mice scampering to
and fro.  More open fields extend to the south, while to the west, the
terrain becomes muddier as it draws nearer the Lithling Stream.

All around, tall grass spreads, rippling in the breeze.  In the distance,
scattered trees and low shrubs dot the fields, but here the terrain is flat
and hard, dense with the roots of so much plant life.  Spoor from a variety
of animals can be seen in the grass, most likely making their way towards
the stream.  Open fields continue to the north and east.

Tree-Dotted Plains~
Breaking the monotony of the rolling waves of grass, here the land is
dotted with a few trees, each creating an island of shade within which the
grass is much shorter.  Some of the trees are host to birds\@ nests, with the
birds themselves perched on branches and twittering at interlopers.  The
Dantaron River runs to the north, while open fields continue to the east and
west.  To the south, a rock fire pit forms the center of a small hunting
camp.

Directly to the north, the powerful Dantaron River flows eastwards in the
direction of Earendam and, ultimately, the Uthlin Ocean.  The clay of the
riverbank is slippery, but not too treacherous, and a few tenacious weeds
sprout from the earth, bedraggled and muddy.  Off to the east, the river is

A Path Into the Vale~
The Lithling Road ends here at a bridge leading north across the
Dantaron.  The smooth cobblestones paving the wide, flat road make this the
premier route for transportation of goods out of the valley and north to the
Arien Road for connection to the cities of Earendam and Var Bandor.  The
road continues to the south, while uncultivated fields spread east and west
along the banks of the river.

This sturdy, well-constructed bridge crosses the Dantaron River,
connecting the Arien Plains to the southern Lithling Valley.  Great timbers
secured together by massive iron nails have been daubed over and covered
with cobblestones, creating a road wide enough for cart and wagon traffic. 
The paved road opens north onto the vast, grassy expanse of the Arien Plains
and continues south into the valley.

The terrain rises here to a low hillock, overlooking the Dantaron River
as it flows eastward.  The hill is covered with the same thick, tall grass
as the rest of the surrounding area, with the sounds of small animals
occasionally audible.  The land descends westward to the edge of the river,
while wide expanses of grassland lie to the east and south.

A Small Hunting Camp~
A collection of crude lean-tos made from fallen branches is clustered
around a rock fire pit.  Here and there, bones and teeth are gathered into
loose piles, with the other detritus of camp scattered about more
haphazardly.  Scattered trees rise out of the plains to the north, becoming
denser to the east, while a trodden path to the south leads to a bridge
across the stream.

Throughout the grasslands in the northern part of the valley, trees are
sparsely scattered, but here they are much denser.  Tall, strong evergreen
trees rise all around, blanketing the ground beneath with a thick, soft
layer of needles, along with the occasional pinecone.  Every footstep
crushes dozens of needles, releasing their pungent fragrance.  The trees
thin in all directions, opening onto a small hunting camp to the west, while
the great plantations of Lithling can be seen off in the distance to the
south.

Thick, Lush Grassland~
Here, the grass is even thicker than usual, to the point that footsteps
almost never touch the actual ground.  Further from the rivers, the
outskirts of the great Lithling plantations can be seen to the south:
enormous fields of cropland stretching beyond the horizon.  The bank of the
Dantaron River can be reached to the north, while trees and flowers
punctuate the sea of green to the west and east.

A Flowery Meadow~
This is a very slight depression in the land, in which a whole host of
diverse flowers and shrubs have sprung up.  Wildflowers of all shapes and
colors are scattered, looking all the more vibrant against the unrelenting
background of green surrounding them.  The occasional bee can be seen,
moving from one to the next in search of nectar.  The grass resumes its
prominence to the north and west, giving way to a flooded rice plantation to
the south.  The Lithling Road is directly to the east.

Running the length of the valley, the Lithling Road is the primary trade
route connecting the inhabitants of Lithling to the Arien Plains.  Paved
with broad, flat cobblestones and meticulously maintained by peasant
laborers, it is wide and durable enough to withstand the substantial amount
of cart traffic directed along it.  The road continues north and south, with
the open grassy plains of the northern valley spreading out to the west.

the terrain continues to become more rugged further east.

A Jagged Protrusion of Rock~
A group of sharp-edged rocks stabs chaotically out of the ground here,
weeping muddy dew like pus from corrupted teeth.  The area immediately
around the rocks is bare, save for a few spiteful weeds clinging to life in
the unhealthy-looking soil.  Crude graves are strewn among the rocks and
weeds, covered in mud and lichen.  A short distance away, however, the lush
grass of the vale returns, covering genrly rolling hills to the east and
west.  To the south, a cleared patch of land plays host to a torch-lit guard
post.

A muddy footpath has been beaten through the grass here, leading away
from the plantations and road at the heart of Lithling.  Winding organically
around the trees and rocks scattered in its way, it does not appear to have
been designed, but rather to have arisen quite naturally.  Grass grows to
either side of that path, but it appears healthier to the east, while the
growth to the west is interrupted by a group of jagged rocks.

A Wet, Grassy Field~
Closer to the bogs making up the eastern edge of the valley, the air
becomes misty and damp, leaving dew on the grass all day long.  Each blade
is bent to the ground by the accumulated weight of water, while light is
captured by each pearlescent drop, giving the whole area the appearance of a
submissive court.  A muddy path has been beaten through the grass to the
west, and the smoke from an encampment of ethron wafts from the south.

sturdier bridge further to the north.  To the west, the rope footbridge
extends across the stream, posts dug into the soft, marshy earth of the
riverbank.  The path continues east, along the northern edge of a rice
plantation.

Directly off the rice plantation, this area is kept in reserve for

paddies.  A low dike isolates it from the plantation proper, while a gate in
the middle can be raised or lowered to control the water level.

A Field of Sugarcane~
All around, stalks of sugarcane tower fourteen feet high, their
distinctive segmented stems growing in ratoons.  Fallen stalks and decaying
leaves form a thick mat of soft vegetation on the ground, muffling the
sounds of movement.  The rustling of disturbed stalks can be heard at all
distances: the sound of great numbers of peasant laborers busy with the work
of harvesting.  Far above, a trail of smoke can be seen in the sky,
originating somewhere to the south.

All around, stalks of sugarcane tower fourteen feet high, their
distinctive segmented stems growing in ratoons.  Fallen stalks and decaying
leaves form a thick mat of soft vegetation on the ground, muffling the
sounds of movement.  The rustling of disturbed stalks can be heard at all
distances: the sound of peasant laborers busy with the work of harvesting. 
The tall stalks press together, making the open field seem almost
claustrophobic.

The Edge of a Sugar Plantation~
This is the edge of a great sugar plantation, with a dense press of
stalks and ratoons to the south and west.  A faint plume of smoke trails off
into the sky, originating somewhere far off to the southwest, past a stately
manor house just visible over the stalks of the sugar crop.  The grassy
wilderness of northern Lithling takes over to the north, though a watch-post
stands guard to the east.

A Rudimentary Guard Post~
A wooden stockade stands here, part of a loose network of guard posts
protecting the plantations of central Lithling against incursions from the
east.  Metal braziers mounted on poles provide light at night, while the
guards not currently on watch sit on scattered boulders smoking and playing
at cards, their weapons always close at hand.  The infertile, uncultivated
soil of the valley opens out to the north and south, while a sugar
plantation begins to the west.

An Ethron Encampment~
Several thatch lean-tos characteristic of the Lithling ethron are here,
circled around a dug-out firepit.  The grass has been trampled flat by the
traffic of the ethron and their dogs, leaving grubby splatters of mud around
the base of each shelter.  Their inhabitants cluster around the fire,
cooking and carving, eking out what living they can in the uncultivated
portion of the fertile valley.

A Flooded Rice Paddy~
The already-marshy soil near the Lithling stream has been flooded, giving
rise to a wide area suitable for cultivating rice.  Nearly the whole
plantation is submerged under two feet of water, with the tops of countless
stalks protruding above the surface of the water, bending under the weight
of their seeds.  Passage around the flooded plantation is made easier by a
diffuse network of plank bridges running all over the plantation.  All
around, peasants can be seen wading through the paddies, harvesting the
rice.

Here, the Lithling Road runs directly north and south, forming a
convenient boundary between the Houle and Penlop plantations.  Directly to
the east, a collection of peasant hovels stands amidst the towering
sugarcane ratoons, while the low, flat rice paddies to the west are blocked
off by a sturdy fence.  The road continues north and south.

A Collection of Peasant Hovels~
Close to the Lithling Road, a gathering of crude peasant hovels has
sprung up in the midst of the tall sugarcane stalks.  Each is a shallow
burrow, roofed with daub and wattle, just large enough for a family to
sleep.  The half-dozen hovels are gathered in a circle, at the center of
which a large spot of blackened earth signifies its use as a site for
bonfires.  The burrows themselves are empty, save for mats of vegetation
serving as crude beds.  Sugarcane stalks tower overhead in every direction
save west, where the field is broken by the cobblestones of the Lithling
Road.

rustling of disturbed stalks can be heard at all distances: peasant laborers
busy at harvest or tending the crop.  The tall stalks part to the west and
east, leading to peasant hovels on the one side and the cultivated lawn of a
great manor house to the other.

A Tended Lawn~
A wide expanse of land here has been cleared around a stately white manor
house to the north, its facade made up of a short marble stairway leading to
a columned promenade in front of its door.  The lawn is meticulously tended;
even now, some scythe-bearing peasants can be seen mowing the grass.  A
flower-lined brick walkway leads from the base of the stairs to an open
white gazebo.  The sugarcane crop of the vast Houle plantation extends in
all directions.

The most striking thing about this foyer is its spotless whiteness.  An
elaborate silver chandelier hangs from the ceiling, reflecting nearly as
much light as it creates from its hundreds of mirror-polished surfaces. 
Perfectly clean white ceramic tiles make up the floor, with smaller tiles of
a soft grey placed at checkered intervals.  A huge pair of ornate wooden
doors opens north onto a great banquet hall, while wooden stairs curve
gracefully upwards on the western side of the room, contained by a
wrought-iron railing.

At first glance, the most unusual feature of this pantry is the
preponderance of sugar it contains.  The shelves along the wall seem to
contain an inordinate amount of sugar in all its permutations: brown, white,
powdered, molasses, and sundry others.  The space not occupied by sugar is
filled with foodstuffs typical of any other cellar, such as meats and other
things best preserved in cool, dry places.  The cellar continues to the
east, where it becomes dedicated to the storage of wines.

laboratory is occupied by a stone examining table, currently playing host to
an uprooted stalk of sugarcane.  Shelves along the wall hold a variety of

A Carpeted Landing~
The second story of the Houle manor is carpeted in a muted off-white.  A
door-lined hallway forks in three directions, illuminated by windows and
wall sconces.  Floral arrangements are placed at regular intervals along the
walls, but the decor on this level is otherwise subdued.  Directly to the
north, a narrow staircase winds upwards to a glass-domed observatory.

continues to the east.

The Houle Servants\@ Quarters~
This room is furnished in a manner reminiscent of a ship\@s living space,
though somewhat more comfortable.  A number of hammocks swing from the
ceiling, each containing a pillow atop a neatly folded pile of linens.  At
the foot of each bunk, three footlockers are stacked for the use of their
occupants.  The room is clean and warm, illuminated by a small fireplace in
the northern wall.

Small, round windows are spaced evenly along the southern wall,
overlooking the lawn and the rest of the expansive Houle estate.  Small
vases line the walls, each holding a few flowers.  Occasionally, the sounds
of movement from downstairs are audible: footsteps, closing doors, and
rarely, the clank of kitchenware.  The hallway continues east and west.

A Neatly Organized Bedroom~
This bedchamber appears to be inhabited by a person of meticulous habits.
The bed itself is made up with what appears to be more than servants\@
fastidiousness, with a pair of slippers sitting on the floor at exactly the
positions necessary for a man to step out of bed into them.  Bookshelves
line one wall of the room, next to a small writing desk.  In the corner, a
glass-fronted wardrobe contains a selection of perfectly-creased suits.  A
diminutive harpsichord stands next to the wardrobe.

to the east and west, while the hallway narrows to the north and south.

often.  Reams of paper diagrams and notebooks lie piled all over, with no

place for a mantle.  Atop the mantle is arranged a collection of medals and
decorations bestowed upon generations of Houles, among which Banlad\@s are
not at all underrepresented.  A large, open closet occupies nearly the whole
length of the opposite wall, containing a wide variety of gowns on one side
and suits on the other.

A wooden floor forms a ring just beneath the glass roof of this dome,
while an iron railing is proof against falls.  From this altitude, the full
expanse of the Houle sugar plantation can be seen, stretching from the
Lithling Road to the misty eastern part of the valley.  Beyond, the other
estates of the valley can be seen, though somewhat indistinctly.  Metal ribs
provide structural support for the perfectly clear glass of the dome, and a
narrow stair provides access to the floor below.

Stalks of sugarcane tower fourteen feet high, their distinctive segmented

high wooden fence prevents travel to the east, and the crop opens onto a
tended lawn to the west.

The tall grass of the uncultivated valley is dominant here- the only
plant that will grow in the poor soil.  Most of the indigenous ethron have
been relegated to this area, separated from the wealthy plantations by a
loose line of guard posts.  To the east, the terrain continues to become
more and more unhealthy until it disappears altogether into the obfuscating

Choking white mist blots out the surrounding area, to the extent that it
seems utterly cut off from the rest of the world.  The yielding peat of the
bog is covered intermittently by a layer of cold black water, making footing
quite treacherous.  The bog in general is peculiarly cold, with the thick
mists wrapping clammy tendrils around anything that moves.  The twisting
paths through the bog combine with the obscuring clouds to make direction
very difficult to ascertain.

A Flooded Rice Paddy~
The already-marshy soil near the Lithling stream has been flooded, giving
rise to a wide area suitable for cultivating rice.  Nearly the whole
plantation is submerged under two feet of water, with the tops of countless
stalks protruding above the surface of the water, bending under the weight
of their seeds.  Passage around the flooded plantation is made easier by a
diffuse network of plank bridges running all over the plantation.  To the
south, a low dike connects the plantation to the water of the Lithling
Stream.

The asymmetric shape of Penlop Hall stands before you, with its
distinctive greenhouse protruding to one side.  The network of planks
covering the whole plantation continues up to the very door of the manor,
which rests atop a watertight stone foundation.  Immediately around the
manor, the water of the rice paddies is home to a variety of colorful
aquatic plants, most prominently lilies and orchids.  The rice crop and its
attendant peasants spread in all directions.

sugar estate beyond.  Here, it turns a corner, connecting the eastern wing
of the house to the foyer and the western wing.  Further along, doors take
the place of some of the windows before the hall comes to its end.

A large, humid room built entirely of glass, the greenhouse of Penlop

Rows of shelves hold flowers of every imaginable shape and color, filling

bags from the ceiling.  In one wall, a small grate opens into a smoking-pit.

A Grand Ballroom~
Breathtaking in its beauty, the famous ballroom of Penlop Hall spreads
over a huge area.  The floor is covered in hexagonal tiles of marbled green,
each trimmed with a thin line of gold.  A raised stage at the center of the
room provides space for a small band, whose sounds reach every point in the
room owing to its cunning construction.  Illumination comes from a gold
chandelier in the ceiling, a spindly, almost ethereal work of art.

A Windowed Hallway~
A mass of expansive windows around this corner of the manor admits
sunlight all year long, affording a wonderful view of sunsets over the
river.  Planters hang at regular intervals from the ceiling, containing a
diverse array of exotic flowers, each vibrantly colorful and beautifully
offsetting the color scheme of the house.  The hallway connects the foyer
and cloakroom to the study and solarium, accessible to the south.

The End of the Western Hallway~
The floor at this end of the hallway is covered by a hand-woven rug,
embroidered with an array of colorful patterns, though the Penlop green and
gold are dominant.  The walls are papered in a muted, unobtrusive shade of
pale green, save where they are occupied by doors opening to the west and
south.  Overhead, the pattern of hanging planters continues, no two seeming
to contain the same species of flower.

A Regal Study~
A wide table occupies the center of this room, with an opulent,
high-backed chair behind it.  The far wall is taken up by a row of high,
narrow windows, giving the occupant of the chair quite a majestic aura
during afternoon meetings.  No other seats are present in the room, forcing
visitors to stand under the imperious gaze of the heroic portraits and
statues lining the walls, most prominently a bust of Siri Caal.

murderous struggles for power and succession.  Several bloody wars had to be
fought by their descendants to reunify the realm.

Though enclosed, the high ceiling and many large windows of this room
give it a light and airy feel.  Comfortable chairs are arranged in no
particular order all around, and a thick green carpet has been embroidered
with gold so that glowing threads appear to run through it under the light
of the sun.  Through the windows, the rice paddies and the threshing mill
can be seen, the peasants at work among the crops appearing somehow idyllic
from this vantage point.

The winged stairs enfolding the manor\@s entrance meet here, behind a
railing at a balcony overlooking the foyer.  The whitewashed wood of the
railing gleams in the light; evidence of meticulous care by the Penlop
servants.  From this vantage point, the emptiness of the suits of armor
erected in the foyer is not immediately obvious, making it easy to imagine
what this manor must have looked like in the past, when the Penlop family
still kept its militia.

is to be seen.  The design of the manor is such that only the western half
of the house has an upper story, contributing further to its asymmetric

An Unused Nursery~
This nursery is far too tidy to be in regular use, with all the toys and
playthings arranged neatly in boxes and shelves.  A small window in the far
wall opens out onto the gabled roof of the manor, admitting sunlight and air
on fair days.  A cunningly-concealed metal grate can be lowered when the
window is open, to prevent adventurous toddlers from falling out.  The decor
in this room tends more towards bright, cheerful colors, rather than the
dignified hues characterizing the rest of the manor.

The Widow Penlop\@s Room~
Though Lady Penlop was widowed before she ever took up residence in the
Hall, she steadfastly insisted on living in the master bedroom and keeping
the heirloom bed in it, both to honor her husband\@s memory and to assert her
own legitimacy as the head of the house.  Apart from that one article of
furniture, however, the room is strangely unadorned, the pale green of the
walls uncovered by portraits or other decorations.  The only exception
appears to be a white mantle over a small fireplace, upon which sits a
portrait of the late Tyburn.

beautiful young woman in a white wedding dress.  A scorched wedding ring
sits beside the portrait.  Candles illuminate the makeshift shrine, giving
it a soft glow made all the more poignant by the almost total lack of
decoration in the rest of the room.

The window of this bedroom overlooks the eastern wing of the manor, with
the interior of the greenhouse just barely visible through its fogged glass
roof.  Gesska appears to have inherited her paternal ancestors\@ talent for
horticulture, with a small box garden hanging outside her window, burgeoning
with exotic flowers.  A harp and music stand occupy one corner of the room,
next to a varnished wooden chair.  The bed is well-made, and a bureau with a
vanity mirror completes the picture of a young woman\@s bedroom.

pile at its foot.  Likewise, the fireplace is unlit, but the woodbox is
filled with neatly-cut fuel.  A mirror is mounted in the wall next to a
varnished wardrobe, which stands empty and open, so as to air it out.

Before a Heraldic Banner~

fringed with gold.  Below the banner, a glass sword-case is mounted on the
wall, with a long pillow of red velvet inside.  On either side of the banner
stand steel pillars wrapped in holly, kept somehow in a perpetual state of
flower.  The hallway continues to the north, while doors open to the east

The Butler\@s Room~
The room of the Penlops\@ majordomo is furnished austerely, after his own
taste.  Only a meager wooden cot stands against the wall, covered with
rough, homespun blankets.  The same is true of the nearby writing-desk, an
ancient, worn piece of furniture scarred and pitted by untold years of work,
stained by innumerable drips of ink and candle wax.  The one exception to
this pattern is the closet, within which hangs an array of breathtakingly
elegant black suits.

A Flooded Rice Paddy~
The already-marshy soil near the Lithling stream has been flooded, giving
rise to a wide area suitable for cultivating rice.  Nearly the whole
plantation is submerged under two feet of water, with the tops of countless
stalks protruding above the surface of the water, bending under the weight
of their seeds.  A stone retaining wall marks the edge of the Penlop
plantation, keeping it from flooding the Lithling Road to the east.  The
courtyard of Penlop Hall can be reached to the west.

The Lithling Road~
Running the length of the valley, the Lithling Road is the primary trade
route connecting the inhabitants of Lithling to the Arien Plains.  Paved
with broad, flat cobblestones and meticulously maintained by peasant
laborers, it is wide and durable enough to withstand the substantial amount
of cart traffic directed along it.  The tall sugar crops to the east
contrast starkly with the flat, watery rice plantation west of the road.

A Field of Sugarcane~
Stalks of sugarcane tower fourteen feet high, their distinctive segmented
stems growing in ratoons.  Fallen stalks and decaying leaves form a thick
mat of soft vegetation on the ground, muffling the sounds of movement.  The
rustling of disturbed stalks can be heard at all distances: peasant laborers
busy at harvest or tending the crop.  The dense mass of sugarcane continues
to the east, but thins to the west, where the Lithling Road forms the
boundary between two plantations.

A narrow path has been beaten through the sugarcane, with boards laid out
on the ground to prevent it from getting excessively muddy.  The path leads
through the fields, connecting the rendering mill to the south with the
Lithling Road far off to the west, and allowing the workers of the
plantation to bring fuel and water to the mill.  The boundary between the
path and the crop is stark, with stalks of cane shooting up to their full
height bare feet from the planks.

A Loose Stand of Trees~
The trees here are scarcely more than saplings, with none standing more
than twelve feet in height- indeed, they are dwarfed by the sugarcane off in
the distance to the west.  The plantation is blocked by a fence to the west,
but it can be entered to the north, as that portion is protected by a guard
post off in the distance.  Another such post stands watch to the south,
while uncultivated wilderness spreads eastward until it is swallowed up by
the mists emanating from the peat bogs.

A Wet, Grassy Field~
Closer to the bogs making up the eastern edge of the valley, the air
becomes misty and damp, leaving dew on the grass all day long.  Each blade
is bent to the ground by the accumulated weight of water, while light is
captured by each pearlescent drop, giving the whole area the appearance of a
submissive court.  The sodden grass retains footprints well, with several
animal tracks visible.

The air here is clammy, heavy with mist seeping out of the bogs to the

every step.  Thick mats of algae cover some puddles, making footing quite
treacherous.  Occasionally, tendrils of mist waft out of the bog, almost
dense enough to obscure the signpost of warning against travel in that
direction.

Choking white mist blots out the surrounding area, to the extent that it
seems utterly cut off from the rest of the world.  The sucking peat mud of
the bog is covered intermittently by a layer of cold black water, making
footing quite treacherous.  The bog in general is peculiarly cold, with the
thick mists wrapping clammy tendrils around anything that moves.  To the
west, the fog thins slightly, giving way to the sight of a wooden sign.

A Misty Peat Bog~
Dark, rippling water covers the sucking peat of the bog, concealing many
treacherous footfalls.  Impenetrable clouds of cold white mist swirl all

Muddy-colored weeds survive on the mud in places, but they are sparse and
unwholesome.  Sometimes, splashes and other noises can be heard in the
distance, but sound carries strangely through the dense masses of fog.

Beside a Low Dike~
Here, the rice crop gives way to its main source of water: a sturdy dike
connecting the plantation to the Lithling Stream, which flows by to the
west.  The gap in the earthen barrier is filled by a wooden gate, sealed
with oilcloth, designed to be raised or lowered according to the needs of
the crops and the state of the river.  Striations of algae and slimy green
matter of ambiguous identity are visible at various heights on the
dike, showing past water levels.

The Lithling Road~
Flat, round cobblestones continue the Lithling Road on its course to the
south.  Very few are cracked or indeed even noticeably worn; evidently the
residents of the valley take excellent care of their main trade route.  The
cobblestones are dense enough on the ground that no ruts in the earth are
visible, despite the constant cart traffic on the road.  To the east, the
land is rapidly swallowed up by the Houle sugar plantation, whence
originates a large plume of smoke.

the Lithling Road runs to the west.

Before a Tin-Roofed Warehouse~
A wide swathe has been carved out of the plantation to make space for a
large, low warehouse with a tin roof.  At the rear of the warehouse, a row
of fat brick chimneys protrude from the roof, pouring forth thick clouds of
smoke that billow far off into the sky.  A plank road runs from the door of
the warehouse off into the plantations to the north, while the sugar crop
resumes its dense growth to the east and west.

A Field of Sugarcane~
All around, stalks of sugarcane tower fourteen feet high, their
distinctive segmented stems growing in ratoons.  Fallen stalks and decaying
leaves form a thick mat of soft vegetation on the ground, muffling the
sounds of movement.  The rustling of disturbed stalks can be heard at all
distances: the sound of great numbers of peasant laborers busy with the work
of harvesting.  A thick plume of smoke billows overhead, appearing to have
its origin close by to the west.

A Rudimentary Guard Post~
A wooden stockade stands here, part of a loose network of guard posts
protecting the plantations of central Lithling against incursions from the
east.  Metal braziers mounted on poles provide light at night, while the
guards themselves keep a sharp eye on the east, where a band of ethron
nomads has set up camp.  A great sugar plantation spreads out to the west,
while a small pond lies to the south.

An Ethron Encampment~
Several thatch lean-tos characteristic of the Lithling ethron are here,
circled around a dug-out firepit.  The grass has been trampled flat by the
traffic of the ethron and their dogs, leaving grubby splatters of mud around
the base of each shelter.  Their inhabitants cluster around the fire,
cooking and carving, eking out what living they can in the uncultivated
portion of the valley, pressed between the plantation guards and the haunted
bog.

By a Border Post~
A tall, strong pole has been driven into the soft mud here.  Twine and
string fastened to its top support a brace of desiccated srryn skulls, some
appearing oddly deformed, and all rattling in the breeze with the eerie
dryness of bone.  From a distance, the post looks almost like the
medicine-stick of some giant shaman.  The mud continues to the north, while
an encampment of ethron lies west.

A Misty Peat Bog~
The cold, choking mists blanketing the bog make navigation virtually
impossible, and indeed even breathing is difficult due to the sheer amount
of moisture in the air.  The wet fog seeps through clothing, causing a chill
somehow more complete than a cleaner, sharp cold.  Very little light is
admitted through the mist, suffusing the area even at midday in a moribund
grey pall.

A Submerged Rice Crop~
This part of the plantation seems to be more or less continuous with the
Lithling Stream; indeed, the water of that river moves so slowly that rice
would probably thrive if planted directly in it.  Nevertheless, a sparse row
of staves pokes out of the water, each tipped with a splash of green paint,
marking the western boundary of the Penlop lands.  To the north, the land is
slightly lower, necessitating the interposition of a dike between the rice
paddies and the river, which can be reached directly to the west.

Scattered Peasant Huts~
In the midst of the marshy rice paddies, peasant huts rest on ingenious
raft-like contrivances, keeping their occupants out of the water inundating
the fields.  Each raft is supported on wooden stilts driven into the ground
beneath the water, while hoops around the stilts allow the huts to rise and
fall with the water level.  Their floors are sealed against the water by
pitch, atop which a layer of mud has been daubed, in turn covered by rough
homespun rugs.

A Submerged Field of Rice~
All around, the ground is submerged under a foot or two of water.  The
tops of rice stalks protrude from the water, burgeoning under the weight of
the seeds.  Peasants can be seen at all distances, wading through the
paddies and collecting the ripe seeds in large cloth aprons.  The flooded
paddies continue in all directions save west, where the space is occupied by
a scattering of peasant huts.

A Drying Raft~
This area of the plantation is occupied by a large wooden raft floating
atop the water.  Wet rice, fresh from the harvest, is scattered across the
raft, ready to be dried in the sun.  A cloth awning can be stretched over
the raft in time of rain, and the area is constantly active enough that no
guard is needed to drive away hungry birds.  Periodically, peasants wade to
and fro, either depositing a fresh load of rice or carrying some off to the
threshing mill to the southwest.  The Lithling Road runs to the east.

The Lithling Road~
Running the length of the valley, the Lithling Road is the primary trade
route connecting the inhabitants of Lithling to the Arien Plains.  Paved
with broad, flat cobblestones and meticulously maintained by peasant
laborers, it is wide and durable enough to withstand the substantial amount
of cart traffic directed along it.  Plantations take up the entirety of the
land on either side of the road: sugar on one side, rice on the other.

The most striking feature of this stifling hot chamber is a row of huge
bronze vats standing in a row against the back wall.  The vats decrease
slightly in size from left to right, with their undersides illuminated by
the red glow of a long fire pit underneath.  Bales of harvested sugarcane
are piled up to the ceiling in orderly rows, occupying most of the rest of
the room.  Peasant laborers are constantly on the move, either tossing bales
into the largest of the bronze vats or feeding the fire from a
seemingly-inexhaustible woodpile.

the sugarcane fields beyond.  A guard post lies north, while the ground
firms to stability to the south.

footprints of all shapes and sizes are stamped into the ground in a dense,
indistinguishable mass, though it can be determined that both people and
animals are represented.  Some of the tracks appear directed north, toward
an ethron camp, while others head east, closer to the bog.

A Path Into the Bog~
The air here is clammy, heavy with mist seeping out of the bogs to the
east.  The ground is sodden, riddled with puddles, clinging to the feet with
every step.  Thick mats of algae cover some puddles, making footing quite
treacherous.  Occasionally, tendrils of mist waft out of the bog, almost
dense enough to obscure the signpost of warning against travel in that
direction.  To the south, a guard tower rises, keeping watch over the
approaches from the east.

Choking white mist blots out the surrounding area, to the extent that it
seems utterly cut off from the rest of the world.  The yielding, sucking
peat mud of the bog is covered intermittently by a layer of cold black
water, making footing quite treacherous.  The bog in general is peculiarly
cold, with the thick mists wrapping clammy tendrils around anything that
moves.  To the west, the fog thins slightly, giving way to the sight of a
wooden sign.

Less a mill than one of the very few pieces of stable dry land on the
Penlop estate, this roofed building is open to the air on all sides.  A
hard, plank floor is propped out of the water on rows of sturdy wooden
supports.  Upon the floor, peasants are busy at work threshing and winnowing
the rice, separating out the chaff until it is ready for packing into the
one of the myriad burlap sacks piled nearby.  Periodically, peasants wade up
from the paddies, depositing a new pile of dried rice to be threshed.

Flat, round cobblestones continue the Lithling Road on its course to the
south.  Very few are cracked or indeed even noticeably worn; evidently the
residents of the valley take excellent care of their main trade route.  The
cobblestones are dense enough on the ground that no ruts in the earth are
visible, despite the constant cart traffic on the road.  To the east, a
wooden fence marks the boundary between the sugar plantation and a great
expanse of vineyards to the south.

The Houle sugar estate comes to its end here, by a rough-hewn wooden
fence demarcating it from the Benedar vineyards to the south.  The crop
itself ends a short distance away from the fence- about the length of a
human arm, in fact.  Whatever its other virtues, the fence appears to be
primarily a formality, as the Lithling Road runs straight by directly to the
west.  The sugar plantation continues to the north.

A Gently Sloping Field~
Very gently, the ground rises out of the mire near the eastern bogs-
almost imperceptibly, but enough to make the earth much firmer.  Almost
instantly, the thick grass of the plains reappears, as though from hiding. 
Further to the south, the flatlands change, with the grass becoming a more
golden, seed-bearing type.  To the southwest spread the vineyards of the
Benedar plantation, reaching almost all the way to the Lithling Stream on
the horizon.

Further from the sodden bogs, the ground becomes more stable, though

appearance.  Worms and slugs crawl through the muck, burrowing through and
about the soft ground in what can only be called revelry.  The ground
becomes firmer still the west and south, though the mud extends to the east.
A wide pit in the ground to the north holds a shallow pond.

liquid surface of brown-green mud, covered in impenetrable clouds of white
mist.  The grasping, wet tendrils of the mist insinuate themselves all
through your person, leaving behind a bone-chilling dampness.  This,
combined with the constant sucking pressure of the mud, gives rise to an
impression that the bog is trying to pull you down.

An Orderly Vineyard~
Orderly wooden racks are laid out in long, uniform rows, each supporting
a heavy mass of pruned grapevines.  The arrangement is remarkably
consistent, as if it had been laid out precisely according to a book of
instructions.  Virtually no variation is visible in the vineyards, save
where the arrangement of trellises is broken by one of the wooden buildings
necessary to process the grape crop into wine.

An Orderly Vineyard~
The vineyards of the Benedar family spread out before you, uniform rows
of vine-bearing trellises stretching off far into the distance.  The
arrangement is remarkably consistent, as if it had been laid out precisely
according to a book of instructions.  To the east, the Lithling Road cuts
through the plantation, while the rows are interrupted in other places by
worksheds.

The Lithling Road~
The Lithling Road resumes its southward course here, running through the
center of the Benedar vineyards.  Paved with broad, flat cobblestones and
meticulously maintained by peasant laborers, it is wide and durable enough
to withstand the substantial amount of cart traffic directed along it.  To
the east, the road turns to the north.

A Bend in the Lithling Road~
The Lithling Road turns to the west here, skirting a few of the
outbuildings of the Benedar vineyards to run very near the manor house off
to the southwest.  The cobblestones paving the road are dense enough on the
ground that no ruts in the earth are visible, despite the constant cart
traffic on the road.  To the west, the road turns back towards the south,
again taking up its course along the valley.

A Field of Tall Grass~
Tall plains grass thrives here, rising to a height of about three feet
and sometimes pricking at the legs of travelers.  Burrs, pollen, and bits of
dead grass rapidly accumulate on shoes and legs, almost necessitating a stop
every few dozen paces to brush them off.  The field is teeming with field
mice and voles, constantly scampering about in panic.  Hawks wheel overhead,
occasionally stooping with a cry and crashing down into the field.

A Flowery Field~
The grassland here is dotted with small wildflowers, with buttercups,
bluebells, and violets trembling delicately in the breeze.  Here, the ground
is perfectly flat, without even the occasional boulder breaking the
glass-like uniformity of the terrain.  This flatness makes the immediately
surrounding area look almost like a window onto a far-off plane of green. 
Fields continue to the west, while a huge dolmen stands to the south.

A Cold, Murky Pond~
On the fringes of the eastern bog, this wide pond is shallow enough to
enable the survival of a variety of plants.  Colorful orchids and lilies
spring out of the water, creating a defiant splash of vibrant color against
the brooding gloom of the damp fog.  This area of beauty, however, succumbs
all too soon to the drab muddiness of its surroundings.

A Misty Peat Bog~
The cold, choking mists blanketing the bog make navigation virtually
impossible, and indeed even breathing is difficult due to the sheer amount
of moisture in the air.  The wet fog seeps through clothing, causing a chill
somehow more complete than a cleaner, sharp cold.  Very little light is
admitted through the mist, suffusing the area even at midday in a moribund
grey pall.

A Misty Peat Bog~
Choking white mist blots out the surrounding area, to the extent that it
seems utterly cut off from the rest of the world.  The wet, sucking peat mud
of the bog is covered intermittently by a layer of cold black water, making
footing quite treacherous.  The bog in general is peculiarly cold, with the
thick mists wrapping clammy tendrils around anything that moves.  The
twisting paths through the bog combine with the obscuring clouds to make
direction very difficult to ascertain.

A Misty Peat Bog~
Dark, rippling water covers the sucking peat of the bog, concealing many
treacherous footfalls.  Impenetrable clouds of cold white mist swirl all
around, seeming to rise in wisps from the surface of the water. 
Muddy-colored weeds survive on the mud in places, but they are sparse and
unwholesome.  Sometimes, splashes and other noises can be heard in the
distance, but sound carries strangely through the dense masses of fog.

The Lithling Road~
Flat, round cobblestones continue the Lithling Road on its course to the
south.  Very few are cracked or indeed even noticeably worn; evidently the
residents of the valley take excellent care of their main trade route.  The
cobblestones are dense enough on the ground that no ruts in the earth are
visible, despite the constant cart traffic on the road.  Here, the road runs
through fields of orderly vineyards.

A low ceiling keeps the rain off of this work area, where peasant
laborers carry wooden wine barrels in and out of the basement.  The ones
that are brought up are arranged on shelves and tapped, whence the wine is
decanted into bottles made from the distinctive amber glass of the Lithling
vineyards.  Finished bottles are packed into crates and carted off for
trade.

The Edge of the Vineyards~
The grape vineyards come to their end here, bounded to the south by the
enormous Lethet wheat plantation and to the east by the uncultivated wild
grass of eastern Lithling.  Nevertheless, the Benedar planners have made
full use of the space, laying out the wooden vine trellises in exactly the
same order as the rest of the estate.  An open bottling shed stands to the
west.

A Brambly Thicket~
For whatever reason, the grass in this portion of the valley has been
crowded out by a thick mass of briars and thornbushes.  Countless ants crawl
over the shrubs, eating or carrying off pieces of the bitter white berries
hanging in places.  To the north, the fields are again covered by thick
waves of grass, while the orderly vineyards and worksheds of the Benedar
winery extend directly to the west.

Three rough-hewn rocks are piled here in a dolmen, each appearing to

boulder serving as a lintel to the door-like shape.  Each of the rocks is
completely covered with paintings in a spectrum of earthy colors, with
browns, reds, and dark greens predominating.  A strange aura of peace that
is somehow also wild permeates this place.

A mass of shattered rocks covered in slimy moss suddenly looms out of the
mist.  Molds, lichens, and fungal scum of every description drape the rocks
in a blanket of decay, glistening wetly in the diffuse light.  The ground
here is slightly firmer, a welcome change from the yielding mud of the
surrounding area.  The rocks form a natural barrier blocking travel in every
direction save one.

templar commanders in full battle regalia.  The front door of the Benedar
manor opens to the west.

floor in a great sunburst pattern, glittering in the light.  Busts, mirrors,
and hangings line the walls, all made from the very finest materials, but
tending to clash with each other.

trying to buy its way to prominence.  An almost excessively-decorated pair
of doors opens to the west.

claws to resemble a lion\@s feet.  A narrow purple cloth embroidered with
gold thread covers only the top of the table, leaving its decorated regions

similar to that of the table, opens to the east, while the dining room
continues to the north.

This kitchen is kept absolutely spotless, with utensils and tools made
from real metal polished to mirror cleanliness.  The aproned staff go about
their business with silent efficiency, not speaking except when necessary to
request an ingredient.  Everything is done with machine-like smoothness, and
any dirtied tool is almost immediately washed, dried, and returned to its
proper place.  A narrow stairway in the corner spirals down to the wine
cellar.

This wine cellar is thoroughly modern.  A narrow hallway stretches a

spaces for wine bottles.  The river, in fact, runs just beyond that wall,
keeping it and the bottles much cooler than they would otherwise be. 
Periodically, the rows of wine bottles are interrupted by a stack of wooden
casks, placed here to age for the personal use of the Benedars.

An Ornamented Hallway~
The ostentatious decoration of the Benedar manor continues here, shifting
themes with a disjointed rapidity that would be sickening in a physical
motion.  The only criterion unifying the choice of paintings and hangings
appears to have been great expense.  Works from every corner of Avendar are
represented, with woven hangings from Ryarl overlooking a seven-years\@
carpet from Ashta Harrud.  The hallway continues east and south.

In this room, the garish decorations of the manor are subdued, partially

from some terribly exotic brand of cigar, thickest near the broad, flat desk
at the center of the room.  A wide window occupies most of the eastern wall,
but it is covered by curtains of thick crimson velvet.  A door made of ivory
and trimmed with gold opens onto the hallway.

gold-lettered tomes on genealogy and philosophy are prominently displayed. 
The floor is covered with a decorative rug marvelously embroidered, but the
rug is almost entirely obscured by the bookshelves on top of it.

The walls at the end of the hall are largely bare, but that serves only
to accentuate their contrast with the exotically-carved wooden staircase
ascending the full height of the manor, from the basement to the upper
story.  Each column supporting the railing is an individual caryatid,
slender and nude.  The riser of each stair depicts a single scene from the
history of Earendam.  In the proper setting, this staircase would be a thing
of breathtaking beauty.

riser of each stair depicts a single scene from the history of Earendam.  In
the proper setting, this staircase would be a thing of breathtaking beauty. 
A well-appointed training room can be reached to the west, while a door
stands to the north.

A Training Room~
Heavy leather cylinders of various sizes hang from the ceiling all over
this room, swaying ponderously.  The walls are lined with racks of blunted
weapons, from commonplace swords and daggers to kranl\@sae and some even more
exotic.  Wooden blocks padded with a thick layer of cloth are stacked in
places, moveable so as to provide different arrangements of obstacles.  Worn
patches and stains on the floor indicate that this room sees heavy use.

Cages packed with straw line the walls and floor, each home to animals
from every corner of the world.  The noise and smell of the captive animals
are almost overwhelming, as some of the more energetic ones roar and spit at

dedicated to predatory cats, with an extremely rare kirre occupying the

This portion of the menagerie is comparatively empty, removed some
distance from the dense masses of cages and animals to the west and south. 
A solid post stands in one corner amidst a pile of straw bedding, with a

stone floor in places, particularly around a smaller post towards the center

A Noisy Menagerie~
This corner of the menagerie is devoted to a collection of apes and
monkeys, brought from far-off jungles.  Grasping at the bars of their cages,
they hoot and scream incessantly, throwing anything they can reach at each
other.  The noise and stench are truly abominable.  The floor is covered

The Top of an Ornate Staircase~
The walls at the end of the hall are largely bare, but that serves only
to accentuate their contrast with the exotically-carved wooden staircase
ascending the full height of the manor, from the basement to the upper
story.  Each column supporting the railing is an individual caryatid,
slender and nude.  The riser of each stair depicts a single scene from the
history of Earendam.  In the proper setting, this staircase would be a thing
of breathtaking beauty.  To the north, a hallway bisects the upper story of
the manor.

A Decorated Hallway~
The walls of the manor\@s upper story are bedecked with the deep crimson
and violet of the Benedar heraldry.  In contrast to the rest of the house,
this hall is comparatively unadorned, giving the hall an aloof, brooding
quality only slightly tainted by the self-consciousness of the other
decorations.  Doors stand to either side of the hallway, while it ends to
the north before a large banner.

With the exception of a few posh leather armchairs, this room is entirely
empty.  The eastern wall is wholly taken up with an enormous map of Avendar,
exceeding eleven feet on a side.  The map has been drawn to an incredible
level of detail, with ever road occupied by travelers and animals drawn in
the forests.  The bulk of the main continent is prominently placed at the
center, enfolded by the Sea of Lidraeu to one side and the Uthlin Ocean on
the other.  Even the outer islands of Alensha and Ilodaiya are present,
nestled in the corners of the vast expanse of painted cloth.

a narrow, utilitarian cot with a hard straw mattress.  The walls, however,

The Lithling Road~
Flat, round cobblestones continue the Lithling Road on its course to the
south.  Very few are cracked or indeed even noticeably worn; evidently the
residents of the valley take excellent care of their main trade route.  The
cobblestones are dense enough on the ground that no ruts in the earth are
visible, despite the constant cart traffic on the road.  The road is bounded
by long rows of grapevines to the east and west.

A Huge Wine-Press~
A wide pit in the ground has been lined with sealed planks. 
Periodically, peasants move past, emptying baskets full of grapes into the

workers to descend and fill barrels with the juice from the pressed grapes. 
These barrels are then taken away for storage and fermentation underground.

Ramshackle but serviceable huts stand here amidst the grapevines,

rocks forms a firepit.  Overall, the area is clean, with very little refuse

An Open Field of Wheat~
The flatlands at the heart of the Lithling Valley are covered with vast
fields of golden wheat, the countless ears standing between three and four
feet high.  Each breeze ripples through the crop in sweeping waves, making
the whole look very much like an ocean.  The Lethet wheat plantation
continues south and east, while a gap in the picket fences leads north to an
expanse of vineyards.

An Open Field of Wheat~
The terrain here is largely flat, rolling only very gently.  The soft
undulations in the ground are betrayed by the surprisingly uniform heights
of the wheat ears, which follow them with perfect fidelity.  In contrast
with the rich diversity of rodents and other small fauna present in the
uncultivated grasslands of the vale, these fields are kept rigorously free
of pests, with the only sounds coming from the wind rustling through the
crops and the occasional bird.

A Misty Peat Bog~
Dark, rippling water covers the sucking peat of the bog, concealing many
treacherous footfalls.  Impenetrable clouds of cold white mist swirl all
around, seeming to rise in wisps from the surface of the water. 
Muddy-colored weeds survive on the mud in places, but they are sparse and
unwholesome.  Sometimes, splashes and other noises can be heard in the
distance, but sound carries strangely through the dense masses of fog.

A Misty Peat Bog~
Shifting, liquid peat yields at some indeterminate point to black, opaque
water, the transition so gradual that it is impossible to determine exactly
where one becomes the other.  Only a few mud-spattered, unwholesome-looking
weeds are able to survive in the soggy earth, drooping and wilted for want
of direct sunlight.  Everywhere, thick fog encroaches, making it almost
impossible to see more than a few feet.  The great masses of mist in the air
play curious tricks with sound, sometimes deadening it but sometimes
carrying it strangely.

A Misty Peat Bog~
The black water inundating the bog is opaque, but even the ripples of
movement fail to show all but the faintest glimmers of reflected light. 
Light, like sound, seems to be almost entirely swallowed up by the heavy
fog, which presses like a blanket of lead upon the land.  Only a diffuse,
pallid half-light is in evidence, sapped of its vitality by the mist.  The
wetness of the air seeps into and through you, making movement a wearying
prospect.

Clouds of mist flow with dirgelike sluggishness around a mass of wet,
slime-covered rocks, arranged in what appears to be a cairn.  The air is
colder here, the insidious chill of the mist harsher and more insistent, the
suction of the sodden peat underfoot greedier.  The fog closes in,
separating this wet, cold land entirely from the sun and the world outside. 
The motion of the mist seems to create whispering noises just beyond

Row on row on row, whitewashed wooden trellises stretch off into the

Lithling Road to the east, whence the peasants disperse into the eastern

characteristic fastidiousness as the road passes neat rows of grapevines
supported by wooden trellises.  To the south, the vineyards end, and the
land is dominated by vast fruited plains of wheat.  Manor houses are
silhouetted against the horizon in several directions.

The Edge of the Vineyards~
The orderly rows of grapevines and trellises come to their end here, by a
whitewashed picket fence separating the Benedar estate from the Lethet wheat
plantation to the south.  Full use has been made of all the available land,
with grapevines running right up the the edge of the fence.  Some, indeed,
have extended creepers to the fence itself, though these are kept carefully
pruned back on the proper side of the fence.  A gap in the fence opens east,
providing access to the wheat fields.

Beside a Whitewashed Picket Fence~
To the north, a wooden fence forms the boundary between the Lethet estate
and that of the Benedars.  On the other side, a collection of peasant huts
can be seen, forming a break in the long rows of vine-bearing frames.  Here,
an enormous crop of golden wheat springs from the ground, almost gleaming in
the light.  The wheat fields continue east and south, while a gap in the
fence to the west provides access to the vineyards.

An Open Field of Wheat~
The terrain here is largely flat, rolling only very gently.  The soft
undulations in the ground are betrayed by the surprisingly uniform heights
of the wheat ears, which follow them with perfect fidelity.  In contrast
with the rich diversity of rodents and other small fauna present in the
uncultivated grasslands of the vale, these fields are kept rigorously free
of pests, with the only sounds coming from the wind rustling through the
crops and the occasional bird.

The Edge of a Huge Wheat Field~
A sturdy fence made from split rails marks the eastern boundary of the
Lethet wheat plantation, with the crops giving way to the lifeless mud near
the misty bogs.  On this side of the fence, however, the ground remains
sturdy and fertile, its arability fully exploited by generations of Lethets
and their peasant workers.  The ears of wheat thrive all around, growing in
a dense press of healthy gold.

An Open Field of Wheat~
Tall, healthy stalks of wheat thrive in this fertile cropland, a primary
source of food for people ranging from here to Var Bandor and even Earendam,
far off to the north.  Immediately to the north, the way is barred by a
whitewashed picket fence, separating this plantation from the Benedar
vineyards.  To the east, the Lithling Road runs north and south along the
valley.

The Lithling Road~
The paved Lithling Road continues south through the heart of the valley,
the breadbasket of Avendar.  Fields of wheat spread all around, covering the
earth in a gently undulating sea of gold.  As it runs off past the horizon,
the openness of the scene evokes a strong feeling of freedom and openness,
endless possibilities unfolding with the waves of grain.  The stones of the
road continue to the south.

An Open Field of Wheat~
The flatlands at the heart of the Lithling Valley are covered with vast
fields of golden wheat, the countless ears standing between three and four
feet high.  Each breeze ripples through the crop in sweeping waves, making
the whole look very much like an ocean.  The Lethet wheat plantation
continues in all directions save east, where a snarl of jagged rocks renders
the land unsuitable for farming.

The Lithling Road~
Flat, round cobblestones continue the Lithling Road on its course to the
south.  Very few are cracked or indeed even noticeably worn; evidently the
residents of the valley take excellent care of their main trade route.  The
cobblestones are dense enough on the ground that no ruts in the earth are
visible, despite the constant cart traffic on the road.  A dense crop of
wheat covers the land to the west, and a tended orchard lies east.

A Cultivated Orchard~
Various types of fruit trees dot the lawn of an ornate manor house, its
exterior encrusted with gold and bright paint in a very old style.  The
trees are wide, but not very tall; evidence, perhaps, of their great age. 
Expertly-manicured shrubs stand between some of the trees, each trimmed into
a masterpiece of topiary art.  The manor can be entered through a striped
door, while a crunchy gravel walkway connects it to the Lithling Road to the
west.

creating a palpable aura of history.  Equally-ornate hallways extend in
either direction from the foyer.

with precious metals glittering from all around in the light.  The
accumulated wealth of many, many years is displayed, some of it in the form
of portraits and landscapes lining the walls in styles reaching far back in
history.  The finery of the hallway combines with the passage of time
evident in the art to give the manor a palpable aura of history and
reverence.

The End of a Gold-Encrusted Hallway~
Jewels and precious metals gleam on the walls and ceilings like droplets
of water in a cave.  This is further bolstered by the almost complete lack
of windows, after the fashion of architecture when the manor was built.  The
dry warmth of the hallway, however, contrasts strangely with this
impression, creating a wholly unique environment.  A bejeweled stair ascends
to the upper level of the mansion, and the hallway continues to the south.

An Open Patio~
The back yard of the Lethet manor is a square, low-fenced affair,
existing primarily to connect it to some of its small outbuildings.  Here,
immediately outside the back door, a number of strikingly red bricks form a
round patio, with wrought-iron chairs arranged around a table.  A
brick-lined path branches off from the patio, heading north through a
garden.

An Oppressively-Tended Garden~
This garden is very neat, appearing to be tended with an almost neurotic
attention.  The flowers are all of precisely the same height, without even
an inch of variation between them, all bearing almost exactly the same
number of blooms and even petals.  Likewise the shrubs, each of which is
pruned back to an unhealthy degree.  A red brick path runs through the
garden, leading east into an aviary and south to a round patio.

Straw covers the hardwood floor of this stable-like building, serving to
soak up most of the droppings from the hooded birds of prey tethered to
rails running along the walls.  Goshawks, eagles, and falcons are in
evidence, with some more exotic birds only very rarely seen here on the main
continent of Avendar.  Thick falconry gauntlets and other supplies hang from
hooks on the walls.  A door opens onto a garden to the west.

glare from the many candles suspended by chains hanging like stalactites. 
An angular table made from a slab of some exotic stone has been polished to
glassy smoothness.  Doors open to the east and west.

The unmistakable aroma of freshly-baked bread permeates this kitchen,

kitchen staff, it appears, are involved in baking at some stage of the
process, with much counter space devoted to kneading dough or setting it
aside to rise.  The few not busy with bread are busily plucking or dressing
fowl and other meats.

Constructed after the fashion of a royal throne room from the days before

importance of the person occupying the breathtakingly ornate chair at its
center.  The very walls and ceiling curve subtly inward, creating the
illusion that the occupant of the chair is greater even in physical size.  A
small, bare table of solid silver is set in front of it, used solely for
signing important documents.

If for no other reason than this banner, the gold-encrusted decor of the
manor would feel perfectly fitting.  A faded swathe of blue and silver dyed
into a fabric not to be found anywhere outside historical collections in
this day and age, it seems almost to be the source of the reverential quiet
holding sway all through the house.  If the Lithling Vale can be said to
have a heart, it resides in this banner.

delicate gold thread still gleaming after countless years.

spare iron spectacle-frames are nested atop the plain wooden dresser, which
is crowned with a round mirror just large enough to contain a face.  There

ancient Lethet tradition of the patriarch\@s smoking his pipe in bed.  A
small fireplace is set into the wall, atop the mantel of which sit a
porcelain funerary urn and a portrait of an elderly, dignified woman.

As the hallways in the Lethet manor show a cross-section of art history,
this wardrobe follows the evolution of fashion.  High-necked, broad-hipped
gowns from the distant past gradually give way to the decidedly more risque
styles of the mid-Republican era before shifting again to more subtle finery
focused on the quality of the fabrics rather than their decorations.  Some
of these gowns and dresses may not have been worn for centuries.

The terrain here is largely flat, rolling only very gently.  In contrast
with the rich diversity of rodents and other small fauna present in the
uncultivated grasslands of the vale, these fields are kept rigorously free
of pests, with the only sounds coming from the wind rustling through the
crops and the occasional bird.  The quiet is particularly noticeable to the
east, where a reverential hush holds sway over a tended cemetery.

reverential silence permeates the area, suffusing it with a feeling of

This mill is permeated with the noises of machinery, a constant grinding

rumbles along its stationary counterpart, grinding harvested wheat into fine
flour which falls down a chute into barrels.  The mill opens directly onto a
water wheel in the Lithling Stream to the west.

An Open Field of Wheat~
The terrain here is largely flat, rolling only very gently.  The soft
undulations in the ground are betrayed by the surprisingly uniform heights
of the wheat ears, which follow them with perfect fidelity.  Throughout the
fields, peasants can be seen busy at work, planting, harvesting, and
bundling the crops.  To the west, a door opens to the mill on the river.

An Open Field of Wheat~
The flatlands at the heart of the Lithling Valley are covered with vast
fields of golden wheat, the countless ears standing between three and four
feet high.  Each breeze ripples through the crop in sweeping waves, making
the whole look very much like an ocean.  This part of the valley is largely
empty of buildings, with the mill to the west and the manor house off in the
distance to the east being notable exceptions.

The Lithling Road~
Near the southern end of the wheat plantation, the Lithling Road begins
passing into the cultivated lawns of the villas occupying the southern end
of the valley.  The road goes on and on, its cobblestone pavement never
flagging.  The road is bounded on either side by the Lethet wheat fields,
and continues north into the fertile heartland of Lithling.

The Edge of a Wheat Plantation~
The flat wheat fields of the Lethet plantation come to an end here, south
of the manor house with its old orchard.  A whitewashed picket fence
demarcates the southernmost extremity of the estate, separating it from the
land of the villas to the south.  The Lithling Road runs to the west, and
the wheat crop gives way to a small field of uncultivated grassland to the
east.

A Fallow Grassland~
On the outskirts of the farmlands of the central valley, this area has
been left unplowed, perhaps a relic of some long-forgotten arrangement
between the old plantation families.  The grass is the long, uncultivated
plains type, just like that growing in the northern and eastern portions of
the Vale.  To the south, the land is less wild as it draws closer to a few
aristocrats\@ villas.

The Lithling Road~
Flat, round cobblestones continue the Lithling Road on its course to the
south.  Very few are cracked or indeed even noticeably worn; evidently the
residents of the valley take excellent care of their main trade route.  The
cobblestones are dense enough on the ground that no ruts in the earth are
visible, despite the constant cart traffic on the road.  The surrounding
country is green, but almost artificially so, the growth appearing to serve
only a cosmetic function.

A Sward of Green Turf~
The grass here is very short and very green, evidence that it has been
encouraged rather than suffered to grow.  The surrounding area, in general,
conveys the same impression; more in the character of a park than a real
meadow.  This is furthered by the clean white picket fence delimiting the
southern edge of the Lethet plantation blocking travel to the north.  A
round duck-pond lies to the south, while the tended grass continues to the
east.

servants of visiting aristocrats.  To the east, a path leads to the top of
one of the only hills in Lithling.

A Rocky Hill~
The little patches of earth that cover the rocks of this hill are home to
thick tufts of weeds.  The hill itself looks almost to have been
constructed, perhaps as a dumping ground for rocks found in the nearby
field.  Regardless, it is one of the few places in the vale of Lithling that
are elevated more than a few feet, and here, from its summit, the great
expanse of the plantations to the north becomes truly apparent, vanishing
over the horizon.

The road continues south, drawing near the broad river delta where the

the road around an idyllic park kept for the benefit of visiting noblemen
from Earendam, among whom it is fashionable to keep a villa in this country.
One such villa stands to the west, and a clean duck pond lies to the east.

A large, clear pond occupies the center of the park, rectangular in shape
but without any clearly defined corners.  The shallows are largely devoid of
reeds and marsh-grass, the groundskeepers being under strict instructions to
keep the more unsightly flora and fauna away.  Ducks, geese, and even the
occasional swan paddle serenely about on the glistening surface of the clean
water, occasionally quacking or honking at each other.

This portion of the turf abuts a clear duck pond to the west, home to a
diverse community of waterfowl.  The grass is characteristically
well-tended, reaching to the very edge of the pond.  In some places, wooden
fishing rods are anchored, connected to strings arranged to ring bells when
they are disturbed.  The tended grass continues to the north, blocked to the
south by the Lithling Road and to the east by a country villa.

Having passed through an enclosed courtyard, you find yourself in the
open, airy interior of a stone villa.  A level of balconies runs around the
courtyard, commanding a view both of the elaborate fountain at its center
and of the tended park-like lawn outside.  The rooms spaced around the
courtyard are comfortable but small; evidently the owners prefer to spend
their time outdoors when possible.  A door opens west onto the bank of the
Lithling Stream.

This is a light, airy house, with a high ceiling and walls comprised of
nearly as much glass as wood.  The varnished wood making up the house and
its furniture appear to contain an inordinate density of knots, almost as
though it was designed to emphasize its ruggedness.  The tall, broad windows
command a beautiful view of the manicured lawn outside and the clean pond

The Lithling Road turns east here, moving away from the stream.  Its
flat, round cobblestones are arranged with something more of an eye for the
aesthetic in this part, rather than the strict, efficient utility of its
northern reaches.  This attention blends well with the park-like nature of
the surrounding terrain.  The road continues north and east, skirting the
edge of a clean pond.

The Lithling Road resumes its southward course, moving towards the city
of Bandatar Lith in the distance.  Near the outskirts of the vale, the
somewhat artificial greenery of the villas recedes, yielding to the wilder,
thicker grass characteristic of the central savannah.  Between settlements,
the road becomes noticeably rougher, the cobblestones only replaced when
absolutely necessary.  The road runs west and south.

wild grass of the plains.  To the west, the park-like greenery continues,
carefully tended at the behest of the Earendam aristocrats who keep villas
in this country.  One such villa stands to the north, an open, airy affair
made from smooth planks of varnished wood.  The land is reclaimed entirely
by wilderness to the east.

The misty peat bogs encroaching on the eastern edge of the vale don\@t

tall grass.  Off in the distance to the south, the port city of Bandatar
Lith can be seen, commanding the harbor of Sciahan Bay where the Lithling
Stream empties into the sea.  The road here is considerably less
well-maintained, as this stretch is between jurisdictions and neither the
farmers of the vale nor the traders of the city see fit to repair it unless
necessary.

The Lithling Stream continues to the south, moving out of the expansive
farming valley and into more uncultivated grassland.  The soil appears to be
rockier here, more resistant to erosion.  Perhaps as a result of this, the
stream begins narrowing and flowing faster as it progresses further towards
the sea.  Upstream to the north, the heartland of the Lithling Vale can be
reached following the river.

The marshy shallows of the Lithling Stream are carefully ordered here,
with a strip of reedy mud kept mainly for authenticity\@s sake before the
waters of the stream take over.  A path of terracotta bricks runs from the
door of the villa to the east along a meandering path by the water\@s edge,
passing close by a wooden table.  The scene is undeniably picturesque,
particularly in the evening when the sun sets in the west.  The stream

by a water-wheel supplying power to a mill attached to the Lethet
plantation.  The wheel\@s paddles make a constant, rhythmic splashing sound
as they plunge into the water, drowning out the grinding rumble of the
millstones.  Here, the eastern bank of the stream is kept well dredged,
clear of any vegetable matter that would clog the machinery.

This guard tower is a more serious construction than the loose line of

approaches into the Vale from the east.  This ground level is dedicated to
barracks and armory space, with racks full of weapons and armor arrayed
against the walls while rows of stacked cots provide sleeping space for the
soldiers.  A ladder-like stairway ascends to the upper level.

laborers responsible are the same ones who took care of it before.
