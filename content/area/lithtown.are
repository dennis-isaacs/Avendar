Dressed in a simple and elegant full-length skirt and a somewhat low-cut
silken shirt, this lovely young woman is weighed down with a number of

cheap in the town that few families bother to cook very often, but when they

Dressed in the simple full-length hemp robes of the local order, this
young man looks to be quite new to his vows, and as such a little skittish

Wearing the classic hemp overalls and wooden clods that townsfolk
associate with those that live on the land, this somewhat senile gawker is
doing very little to dispel those bothersome assumptions that put town and
country at odds.  He carries a large sack of grain on his shoulder, no doubt
headed for the travelling merchants in the town square that are willing to
part him from it.

Great wealth tends to go hand in hand with great poverty, and Lithling is
no exception.  This old man appears to have been blinded by some manner of
violence, and was thus unable to support himself or his family.  Now he
wanders the streets in rags, washed only by the rains, and relies upon the
kindness and generosity of others to survive.

A young lieutenant relaxes after a long day in the mustering yard.
~
Lieutenancy in the militia is generally reserved for professional
soldiers, rather than actual local recruits, owing to the need for
proficiency in matters such as field tactics, logistics and training
technique.  This young man looks rather tired and sore, his high-quality
armor coated with grime and dust -- no doubt a result of a grueling shift of
training new recruits in the mustering yard.  Now however, he is the picture
of contentment -- resting in a comfortable chair, feet up on a stool and a
pint of ale in his hand.

Jorreth Illari commander militia spotted hawk~
Jorreth Illari~
The commander of the militia is going over the next day\@s duty rosters.
~
There was considerable furor when the town assembly decided that the new
commander of the city militia would be an aelin mercenary, but the years
have show that decision to have been a wise one.  Jorreth Illari is a
consummate professional officer -- polished, refined, quick-witted -- with
nerves of steel and one of the deadliest blades in the valley.  Preferring
the fine and expensive aelin mesh armor to bulky human chain, he is clad in
what appears to be a shimmering coat of tiny, finely chiseled mirrors.  He
wears the insignia of his rank on a sash across his chest, and the town
crest upon his sliver helm, further decorated with short purple plumes.  His
wings are colored a mottled gray, spotted with black in places, and it is
from these that he is known around the valley as The Spotted Hawk.  Jorreth
is quite a personable officer, and most amicable to any who would come to
him to learn what they can of the art of swordsmanship from his skilled
blades.

Yulian Bekk captain wiry militia~
Yulian Bekk~
A wiry militia captain is enjoying a quiet drink at the bar.
~
A competent officer and a worthy second to Illari, captain Yulian Bekk is
one of the few men to actually rise from a raw recruit to the rank of
captain in the militia.  He eschews the bulky chain mail that is standard
issue in the regiment, preferring instead to wear a lighter studded leather
suit, and rely more keenly on his own wits and agility.  To add further to
his eccentricity, he is left handed, fighting with his sword in his left and
a long dagger in his right -- a combination that has thrown many a more
accomplished swordsman off balance.  What ground Bekk may give in brute
strength and force to other fighters, he more than makes up for in cunning
and battlefield tactics.  Among his more notable features is an ugly scar
that runs across his throat, just above the voice box -- courtesy of a demon
if tales are to be believed, fought while thwarting a shuddeni raiding
party.  Although gruff and spare with conversation, Illari is a rather vain
man and can never resist an opportunity to show off his superb skills, a
fact that many other officers exploit in order to gain a little one-on-one
training.

Recruited from one of the many mercenary companies that pass through the

A young lieutenant gives the recruits a lesson in sword work.

Lieutenancy in the militia is generally reserved for professional
soldiers, rather than actual local recruits, owing to the need for
proficiency in matters such as field tactics, logistics and training
technique.  This young lieutenant is patiently teaching the green recruits
the basics of sword work, and some simple tricks, which might help them win
an engagement.  He wears imported armor and keeps his own expensive swords
in their scabbards, teaching the recruits with garrison issue weapons.

The head baker prepares another tray of dough for the oven.
~
This rotund little man inherited the bakery from his father, who in turn
married into the family business and so forth.  It is almost as if long
association with the totemic oven ensures that all bakers assume a somewhat
portly and red-faced appearance -- or perhaps it is the fact that they
invariably constantly nibble on the dough they are preparing.  Despite his
girth however, he moves about the bakery with an almost mercurial speed and
grace -- juggling the steaming-hot loaves and heated iron trays in hands
long since inured from such minor scalding by a thick layer of calluses.

The proprietress goes over her accounts while manning the reception.

Once upon a time this old woman was the harvest queen of the whole
valley, crowned at the summer solstice festival, many seasons ago.  While
the spring of her youth may long since have faded, those with a keen eye can
still see the signs of potential beauty in her face -- her eyes, the
structure of her bones.  Those with the gift of imagination might even be
able to envisage how she looked so many years ago, the object of every
desirous glance, the avatar of fertility herself.  Many years have passed,
but she has managed to maintain a certain degree of elegance and charm
despite the march of time.  She wears a simple black frock, modestly laced
around the hem and cuffs, offset by the minimum in tasteful jewelry.  It is
rumored by some that she went a little mad when she discovered her husband\@s
infidelities, and madder still when he passed away.  Then again, others
quietly laugh that she has never been saner or happier.

Silaris Bale archmage air~
Silaris Bale~
Silaris Bale, an archmage of air, is going over the results of his latest research.
~
Silaris Bale is quite young for a man of his scholarly standing, no more
than forty-five years of age it would seem.  He is dressed in volumous robes
of pale blue, decorated with a variety of wards and glyphs -- some ornate,
some clearly functional.  He sports a short beard, which he keeps quite trim
and neat, and his light blonde hair is likewise cut short and neatly styled.
By all reports he is a good natured and generous man, willing to share what
knowledge he can with eager students.

Mortimer Keelan~
Mortimer Keelan, an adept of fire, tinkers with a dangerous-looking concoction.
~
Mortimer Keelan is somewhat of a prodigy, advancing to the circle of
adept at the tender age of twenty-three.  Physically however, he is somewhat
frail and sickly, suffering from a variety of slight but niggling illnesses.
He is a handsome man, even if far too thin, with large dark brown eyes, very
pale skin and long dark hair.  He dresses in warm red velvet robes, guarded
by various runes of warding and protection.  By all reports he is a good
natured, even if somewhat exacting, and quite willing to share what

A large surly-looking barman spit-polishes a mug as he eyes the crowd.

Every inch a pirate, this hard-nosed looking specimen is exactly the kind
of person you would expect would decide that running a bar in a place like
this is how they would like to make a living.  His massive barrel-like chest
is a crosshatch of countless knife scars, some of which extend up to his
neck and face.  Somewhere along the line he lost an eye, and decided it
would be amusing to insert a small toy skull into the socket instead of a
patch.  He commands the bar with a snarl and a curse that shuts up the
rowdiest of customers, spurred on by the fact that he does very little to
conceal the large spiked cudgel that lies behind the bar, inches from his
hand.

Varik Holm~
Varik Holm, The Hand-Taker, patiently instructs a young footpad.
~
Wanted by just about anyone associated with the law, Varik Holm is a hero
of the underworld and master of an extensive crime-ring based in the
Lithling valley.  His nickname describes how he punishes those associates
foolish enough to try and steal from him -- he takes both hands, so they
might never hold a weapon to strike back at him.  In person, Varik is a
somewhat diminutive man, standing just under five and a half feet tall.  He
appears to have black hair and dark eyes, although much of his countenance
is sure to be a disguise as a matter of course.  He wears simple
studded-leather armor, bearing no distinguishing marks or vain symbolism. 
His face is likewise remarkably free of any distinguishing scars, a
testament to his skill with the blades and with disguise powders.  Despite
his fearsome reputation, he is an amiable man to those who would work for
him, and quite willing to share his skills to better the talent of his
organization.

Xithahk Yazz~
Xithahk Yazz, an adept of void, studies his art in eerie silence.
~
Xithahk Yazz is what one might call a typical shuddeni adept.  Rigid,
dedicated, fanatical, cunning, he is everything that a young shuddeni
apprentice might aspire to be.  What is not quite right about him is where
he is and what he is doing.  It can be safely said that when his masters
were training him in the temple of Yithoul, they did not foresee a future as
Varik Holm\@s right hand.  The rumors are that it sometimes happens.  The
pillar of Greed is the weakness of shuddeni philosophy, as far as the human
world is concerned.  Sometimes, it overwhelms them, and at such times
shuddeni can be bought -- bought to do just about anything you like, as long
as you pay them amazing amounts of money and fan their egos.  Varik needed
an accomplished void adept to help with transportation and training, Xithahk
was slowly going mad, waiting for just such an offer, the rest as they say,
is history.  Despite the jet-black robes and inscrutable eyeless face,
Xithahk has adopted quite a personable persona, willing to teach and share
his art despite his typical shuddeni arrogance and bigotry.  If you overlook
the occasional seizures, insanity and murderous bouts of sadism, he is in
fact quite charming company.

the old druid~
An old druid works quietly, preparing a poultice while he waits for customers.
~
The old druid appears to be a gentle man, age and decrepitude forcing him
to set up shop in town rather than wander the woods like so many of his
kind.  He is dressed in a simple unadorned robe of brown wool, tied around
the waist by a thin leather thong.  His hair is still lush, although quite
gray, and his beard is likewise health, although somewhat unkempt.  Perhaps
the most noticeable feature are his eyes, that sparkle with the kind of
life, energy and curiosity it is only customary to see in the eyes of a
child.

A Guard Tower~
This sparse but functional chamber is one of the town\@s primary rally
points in times of war.  Built up as an extension of the formidable stockade
walls, this sturdy wooden tower looks to be able to withstand all but the
most determined of siege assaults, as well as considerable magical
punishment.  A number of tables and chairs are scattered about the room, for
the inevitable games of chance which are necessary to relieve the boredom of
sentries on duty.  A weapons rack mounted on the east wall holds the tower\@s
spare armaments, while a sturdy-looking door in the west wall leads out into
Guardsman\@s Way.  A stout staircase stands in the southwest corner of the
room, leading up into the turret.

The Headquarters of the Militia~
This large dispatch is the logistical heart of the town\@s guardsmen. 
Desks are arranged in even rows and columns down the middle of the room,
each one home to a militia clerk in charge of one or the other aspect of the
legal intricacies required to run a busy trading town of this size.  The
north and south walls are covered with bulletin boards detailing various
troop rotations, escort duties, and anything else the officers might need to
know from day to day.  The east wall is covered by an ornate board bearing
the legend \@Bounties\@ and is markedly less cluttered with notices.  A
sturdy-looking staircase in the northeast corner of the room leads up to the
officer\@s commons, while a large door in the west wall leads out onto
Guardsman\@s Way.

The Officer\@s Commons~
This place closely approximates a cozy little tavern.  There is a small
but well stocked looking bar set against the north wall, behind which hangs
the town\@s banner -- not having taken the field since the War of Night.  A
number of tables and chairs are scattered about, most covered with various
official dispatches and troop evaluations, thus lending the commons an air
of laid-back efficiency.  A sizable area towards the center of the room is
kept clear for weapons practice and the occasional impromptu duel.  A
sturdy-looking staircase in the northeast corner of the room leads down to
the dispatch.

A Spacious Home~
Roomy and well appointed, this dwelling is a tribute to the constant flow
of wealth that trade brings to this prosperous town.  The floor is carpeted
in fine dark wool, while the walls are decorated with simple yet elegant
tapestries.  A comfortable-looking bed stands against the east wall, an
ornate wardrobe built into the wall beside it.  The south wall is occupied
by an impressive open fireplace, a pair of soft armchairs positioned around
it for maximum warmth.  A large writing table is set against the north wall,
well appointed and looking much used.  The notable lack of a kitchen
indicates that the owners take most of their meals elsewhere, or have food
delivered.  An elegant door in the west wall leads out onto Guardsman\@s Way.

Ryan\@s Fine Garments~
This large and luxurious-looking store seems almost opulent to the eye,
replete as it is with countless expensive garments and fabrics.  Shelves and
racks line the walls, housing a large variety of clothes -- from coarse work
slacks, to fine courtier\@s gowns.  Occasionally, the racks are punctuated
with a full-length mirror and a small curtain, which serve as changing
cubicles.  A number of mannequins are also spaced around the store, modeling
some of the more expensive gowns on offer.  A small counter is discretely
tucked away against the east wall of the store, a sturdy looking strongbox
standing behind it.  A delicate door in the west wall leads out onto Trade
Road.

Inside the East Gate~
The mud of the road beyond the gate gives way to the small stone cobbles
of the town\@s streets.  Worn with age and the passage of countless feet, the
gently rounded cobbles look as shinny as pebbles in a shallow brook.  The
street widens out from the gates until it assumes impressive proportions --
wide enough for almost three carts abreast, thus allowing for two lanes of
traffic and pedestrians -- well deserving of the name \@Trade Road\@.  To the
east, the stockade looms high above, large gates leading out of the town and
into the valley, while Trade Road continues westward.  South of here, the
stockade has been expanded and reinforced into a large watchtower, a small
door in the side allowing it to double as a gatehouse, while passage north
is blocked by the side of a large and luxurious-looking building.

Guardsman\@s Way~
Lacking the cobbles which typify the rest of the town\@s streets,
Guardsman\@s Way is never the less smooth and relatively free of dust.  This
section of town being almost the exclusive domain of the town\@s military,
the gravel-paved street has been worn down to an almost glass-like polish by
innumerable generations of marching feet.  The street here curves sharply,
hugging the base of the stockade wall, which looms immediately to the north.
Guardsman\@s Way continues west and south, while east of here, the stockade
has been expanded and reinforced into a large watchtower, accessible through
a small door in the side.

Dagger Alley~
Every town above a certain size seems to have a place like this.  The
unfortunate, the dispossessed, the crippled all need a place to go, and if
one were not set aside for them they would clutter the streets and upset the
merchants.  Hence, the militia leave well enough alone, and know where to
start looking if there is trouble.  Dark and narrow, this dusty and
filth-choked alley is a marked contrast to the clean and affluent streets of
this prosperous town.  The stench of rotting refuse is pungent and old, and
the piles of garbage seem alive with all manner of crawling vermin.  The
alley continues on west, meandering along beside the stockade wall which
looms large to the south, and expands out into an impressive looking guard
tower to the east of here.  Northward, the alley spills out onto the
polished cobblestones of Trade Road.

The Mustering Yard~
This large plot of land has been set aside as the drilling and practice
ground for the town\@s militia.  Once a green field -- as a few stubborn
tufts of grass testify -- the tramp of countless generations of booted feet
has reduced the place to a hard-packed dust bowl.  The effect is enhanced
and concentrated by the high wall surrounding the yard, an attempt to grant
the soldiers a measure of privacy while they practice.  A number of archery
targets lean against the west section of wall, while the southern end of the
yard is home to a handful of straw practice dummies.  Stout stone archways
in the wall to the north and east both lead out onto Guardsman\@s way.

The Tender Loaf Bakery~
One of the oldest businesses in town, this ancient bakery has seen many
generations of customers and proprietors pass beneath its sturdy stone
archways.  Dominating the eastern portion of the building, the massive bread
kiln squats like an inscrutable stone totem -- silently observing the homage
being paid to it.  Racks upon racks of all kinds of breads line the north
and south walls -- everything from hard black trail bread, to the daintiest
of soft pastries, as sweet as anything one might find in Earendam.  A large
counter occupies the center of the room, scored with a thousand wayward
slices of the bread knife.  Behind the counter and to one side of the kiln,
a sturdy strongbox protects the day\@s takings.  A large stone archway in the
west wall leads out onto Common Square.

The Merry Widow Inn~
Primarily a hostel for traders and merchants not wishing to spend the
night in their tents, the Merry Widow emphasizes peace and quiet above the
usual rowdiness of a hospice common room.  There is a bar, but it is tucked
away unobtrusively against the south wall and seems more the place for a
nightcap rather than a bought of serious drinking.  The most striking
feature of this glorified reception area is the marble staircase, which
dominates the western portion of the chamber -- a structure which screams
extravagance, considering how far the nearest marble quarry is from here. 
The rest of the decorations are surprisingly conservative and tasteful: a
soft carpet of the floor, neutral unobtrusive tapestries lining the walls,
and a beautiful pine and mahogany desk -- gleaming with polish -- which
serves as the main reception area.  The gaudy staircase leads up to the
guestrooms, while the stout double doors to the east open onto Trade Road.

Guardsman\@s Way~
Lacking the cobbles which typify the rest of the town\@s streets,
Guardsman\@s Way is never the less smooth and relatively free of dust.  This
section of town being almost the exclusive domain of the town\@s military,
the gravel-paved street has been worn down to an almost glass-like polish by
innumerable generations of marching feet.  The street terminates in a small
cul-de-sac here, backing into the side of the magician\@s tower to the west,
and what looks like the rear of the assembly hall to the south.  A small
postern gate can be made out to the north, cut into the looming stockade
wall.  Kept tightly locked, it appears to only be used in emergencies
however.  Guardsman\@s Way itself continues on east.

The Assembly Hall~
Set up somewhat like an amphitheater, this building is evidently used for
actual meetings of the village assembly, rather than any administrative
duties.  The predominant theme is oak and pine, the framework made of the
former, while the paneling quite obviously the later.  The north, west and
east walls support a number of ornate looking benches, about four rows deep,
the ones closest to the walls being the furthest of the ground.  A small
podium stands in the center of the floor, obviously where the speaker stands
to address the assembly.  Impressive double doors in the south wall lead out
into Common Square.

Northeast Common Square~
The pulsing heart of the town, the market spreads out here in an
explosion of colors, sounds and smells.  The ground is paved in find wide
cobbles, made of expensive imported bluestone.  Numerous traders have set up
stalls throughout the square, jostling with some locals who are also trying
to sell their own produce.  Some have even established semi-permanent
kiosks, gaudy pictures and lettering on the sides of these advertising their
wares.  Several travelling merchants have also pitched tent for a day of two
and are selling right off the backs of their pack-beasts, in the hopes of
lightening their load for the continued journey across country.  Common
Square continues west and south, while a wide stone archway to the east
leads into the town\@s ancient bakery.  The building to the north looks
somewhat larger and more ornate than what seems the norm around it, so much
so in fact that a small set of half a dozen steps rise up to the impressive
double doors which serve as its entrance.  An intricate sign is carved above
the doors, framed in polished stone.

Yiegara\@s House of Arms~
Lithling being a common meeting and hiring point for numerous caravan
guards, the services of reputable arms dealer became a logical necessity
early in the town\@s early history.  This establishment was the first, and as
it turned out the only, and has done exceedingly well out of this
arrangement over the years.  The store\@s trappings are opulent: a finely
woven carpet of luxurious wool covers the floor -- seemingly despite, and in
defiance of, the constant stream of muddy battle-boots that tramp over it. 
The paneling is a deep red mahogany, a beautiful contrast to the gleaming
polish of various weapons and pieces of armor which are displayed on
delicate hooks around the walls.  At the south end of the store, a large
counter has been built to house and display the more exotic and expensive
items up for sale.  On the wall behind the counter, a beautiful battle
standard hangs in full view -- the ancient banner of House Yiegara.

smuggling into the valley during the War of Fire that allowed the local
woodsmen to maintain a powerful resistance force against the occupying
armies, and even led to the assassination of a couple of mages of note. 
Lord Yiegara\@s bravery and loyalty during the war were subsequently rewarded
by the newly emerged victorious Republic, granting his house the lucrative
monopoly that they enjoy to this very day.

Dagger Alley~
Every town above a certain size seems to have a place like this.  The
unfortunate, the dispossessed, the crippled all need a place to go, and if
one were not set aside for them they would clutter the streets and upset the
merchants.  Hence, the militia leave well enough alone, and know where to
start looking if there is trouble.  Dark and narrow, this dusty and
filth-choked alley is a marked contrast to the clean and affluent streets of
this prosperous town.  The stench of rotting refuse is pungent and old, and
the piles of garbage seem alive with all manner of crawling vermin.  The
alley continues on east, while here it terminates in a dingy cul-de-sac,
squeezed in between the stockade wall, which looms large to the south, and
rear wall of the arms dealer.  An old dilapidated building stands to the
west, accessible through a pair of saloon-style doors.  A sign hangs above
the entrance, depicting a frothing mug of beer with a large crack down its
side, there is some smaller lettering beneath the picture.

The lower section of this tower has been converted into a store, selling
a variety of ready-made magical artifacts to warriors and scholars alike.  A
number of display cases are positioned around the edge of the circular
chamber, their transparent surfaces allowing shoppers to browse the store\@s
wares without bothering the attendant.  A small counter is set up towards
the rear of the chamber to handle transactions, while a narrow stone
staircase along the northern side of the wall leads up into the upper area
of the tower.  The bare stone floor of the center of the chamber is chalked
with all manner of magical inscriptions and sigils, including what looks

render it transparent -- the effect is both beautiful and erie.  The walls
are lined with a number of bookshelves, especially modified it seems to
snuggly fit the curves of the chamber.  A number of comfortable looking
chairs are strategically placed near the shelves, small light globes
hovering beside them -- ready to flare up at a touch.  The center of the
room is dominated by a large device of metal and stone -- a magical eye used
to peer into the depths of the heavens.  A sprawling worktable stands at the

along the side of the road, their sweat aroma giving the whole promenade a
somewhat pious air.  Temple Road continues west, while northward the white
cobbles give way to the heavy dark paving of Common Square.  The ornately
decorated side of the arms dealer looms to the east, while passage south is
blocked off by one of the many back-lots of Dagger Alley.

While certainly dingy and dark -- as befits its location -- this tavern

and chairs are spread generously but somewhat chaotically about the
premises.  The furniture has a very solid and home-built look about it and
shows the signs of numerous hasty repairs.  A large bar occupies the western
end of the tavern, slick with dried ale and scored by a maze of markings --
the legacy of generations of knife-carrying patrons waiting for their
drinks.  The southern end of the tavern is slightly raised, a makeshift

The Town Shrine~
Expensive yet tasteful, this splendid shrine was built to celebrate the
prosperity of the town and indeed the whole region, while paying homage to
the divine forces whose influence has guarded and nurtured the countless
generations who have lived and died here.  Built primarily of marble and
white granite, this courtyard has been artfully designed in a hexagonal
pattern, with a sparkling white fountain at the center and an ornate marble
pillar opposite each face on the outside.  The six pillars support and
arched stone roof overhead, offering comfortable shade from the sun during
the day, and eerie acoustics for the gurgling fountain at night.  Cut into
the stone at the base of the fountain is a wide marble staircase, leading
down to the vestibules.  The courtyard joins the mad bustle of Common Square
to the east, the serene Temple Road to the south and the quiet shade of
Mandrake Lane to the west, while the hulking mass of the Wet Whistle blocks
of passage north.

feet of thousands of acolytes over the years of this temple\@s existence. 
Stone benches are set into the walls at regular intervals, and illumination
is provided by the odd bracketed torch.  Three stone archways lead off
towards the various altars, the east one made out of white marble, the north
out of gray stone, and the east out of dark obsidian.  There is a
solid-looking oaken door in the southern wall of the chamber, leading off
towards the local priest\@s private shrine.

The Altar of Light~
This peaceful chamber is inlaid with white marble and granite, reflecting
the sparse torchlight from the brackets in the walls to effect a bright
illumination.  The walls themselves are beautifully mosaic, intricately
carved pieces of gold, silver and ivory -- the light playing a merry pattern
across the exquisite images the little tiles have formed.  The northern wall
is a breathtaking mural, Jolinn rising out of the waves to grant a vision of
the Titan Castle to the faithful, while in the background, cities are
engulfed in the flames of war.  The south wall is a radiant portrait of the
goddess Rystaia, resplendent in the aspect of a beautiful Pegasus, with
shining wings of light, raised up on her hind legs and whinnying with joy at
the breaking dawn.  A simple white altar stands towards the western end of
the chamber, while a white marble archway leads east, out into the hallway.

The mural tells the story of the fateful events that led to the defeat of

that Jolinn sent to those who sought him, some of whom were displaced
refugees of the valley.  Of their dangerous journey to the north, their
meeting with the enigmatic Titans who taught them of the strength and
healing power of the sea.  The final battles with the armies of flame are
portrayed in glorious detail, and the last scene shows the founding of this
very temple by the victorious scholars.

The Altar of Balance~
This somber chamber has been left somewhat rough-hewn, emphasizing the
solid gray stability of the stone itself.  The bracketed torches burn low,
guttering and spluttering from the occasional stirring breeze from the
hallway beyond.  The gray stone walls have been left bare, an asture
reminder of the detachment that comes with the burden of balance.  A small
gray altar stands upon a slightly raised pedestal at the northern end of the
chamber, simple and unadorned.  On the wall behind it, a symbol is carved
deeply into the stone -- the only decoration in the entire chamber, a large
stylized crown.  A gray stone archway at the southern end of the chamber
leads out into the hallway.

the light and darkness constantly play across him in such a way that his

The Altar of Darkness~
No torches burn within this chamber, the walls themselves seem to exude
some sort of sickly illumination -- enough to see by, but not enough to be
called light.  There is a slightly rank and pungent smell in the air,
somewhere between decay and desiccation, and no breeze seems to stir here. 
A disturbing mural adorns the northern wall, painted in vivid and lifelike
detail: The fields of Lithling burn, eyeless acolytes of the Sect of the
Shijardu carve a swathe of destruction through the lands and lives of the
people.  The mural appears to be painted onto smooth obsidian with some kind
of phosphoresant paste.  Painstakingly touched up by generations of artists,
the horrific scenes serve as a constant reminder of the power and ferocity
of Arkhural.  The smooth obsidian of the southern wall appears dark, yet
after a moment it becomes evident that the darkness itself has a pattern. 
Swimming within it, blacker than the night itself, a vast beast of fangs and
wings awaits deep within the void.  Patient and timeless, Ashur, the Great
Dragon of the Void, looks secure in the knowledge that in time, all things
come to him.  A simple black altar stands towards the eastern end of the
chamber, while a black obsidian archway leads west, out into the hallway.

mural~
The glowing mural graphically depicts the horrors of the War of Night. 
At the time of the Shuddeni occupation there were inevitably a number of
collaborators among the local population.  The Shuddeni were bloody where
they met resistance, but surprisingly merciful where they were offered none.
In fact, they were rather generous and flattering to those who openly or
covertly aided them.  This, coupled with the rapid and powerful rewards they
offered resulted in a small but noticeable contingent of human converts to
the Sect of the Shijardu.  It is said that some of the acts of atrocity
committed by the small regiments of human cultists far exceeded anything
that the Shuddeni themselves perpetrated during the war.  Rather than hide
from this frightening fact, the people of Lithling have chosen to erect this
memorial to it, as a constant reminder of the horror that the seductive lure
of darkness rapidly leads to.  Ironically, some of the human cultists that
survived the initial rout by the Ch\@Taren chose to stay near their old homes
rather than retreat with their new allies into the darkness of the
underworld, and it is whispered that a form of the cult survives in the
valley to this very day.

dragon~
Little is known in the valley of Ashur himself, or how -- even if -- he
is worshiped.  What little is, comes from the oldest stories, the creation
myths themselves that personify him.  In those myths, Ashur is the essence
of the Void that is everything beyond existence and life -- he is the Void
itself.  As such, the relationship with him is a rather strange one.  As an
entity he pulls towards death and darkness, as that is his nature, but what
he represents in the larger scheme of things is the balancing force that
defines life, and as such his role is accepted and understood -- if not
openly worshiped.  Never the less, as the saying goes \#In the End we all
meet the Dragon\#, so every new years morning there is a small but noticeable
pile of offerings at the foot of his grotesque effigy here.

The Dragon\@s Shrine~
This simple yet elegant chamber serves as a private shrine for members of
the local priesthood, and like-minded visiting scholars.  The stone walls
are decorated with colorful tapestries depicting various seasonal aspects of
life in the valley: a fishing expedition on the lake, the annual burning of
a sugar-cane field, young calves taking their first steps.  Wooden benches
have been set towards the sides of the room, for quiet rest and meditation. 
Towards the south part of the chamber, a small fountain sends a gentle
stream of water trickling into the basin below it.  The fountain is made of
white marble shot with blue quartz, and fashioned in the shape of a
beautiful dragon.  On the south wall beyond the fountain, a large tapestry
tells the story of Shyela-Kyra, an ancient blue dragon who saved the valley
from ruin during the War of Fire.  A solid-looking oaken door in the
northern wall leads out into the hallway.

The tapestry is divided into two sections.  The first tells of the events
that led to Shyela-Kyra\@s coming, while the second shows what she did.  
~
E
first~
The first section of the large tapestry tells beginning of an ancient
tale dating back to the War of Fire that may or may not be a legend.  It is
said that the strongest pockets of human resistance to the Scholars of Fire
were right here in the valley, and that the people paid a heavy cost as a
result.  When news of the return of the questors and military reversals
against the Armies of Flame in the far north started to trickle down, the
rebellion in Lithling started in earnest.  At first the Srryn and their
human allies were taken by surprise, and their vital supply lines to the
north were in serious danger.  In desperation, the Scholars of Flame awoke a
mighty and ancient being of fire -- a red dragon that had lain dormant deep
within the underworld for centuries -- and sent it south to burn the rebels
out.  Their plan was partially successful.  Their attention distracted by
the new threat in the north, the powerful dragon slipped out from under
their control -- if it in fact ever even was.  At first it helped the Srryn,
but soon it began to burn all in its\@ path.  Friend and foe died alike, and
Lithling was in danger of becoming a wasteland.  
~
E
second~
The second section of the large tapestry continues the tale.  Exactly how
or why Shyela-Kyra arrived is unclear.  Some say that she lived far to the
south, beyond the Saerin Ranges, and was drawn by the vast smell of burning.
Others maintain that she rose from the depths of the Uthlin Ocean, sent by
Jolinn himself to save the valley and the Inner Kingdoms themselves from
ruin.  Whatever the case, a second dragon appeared in the skies over the
valley -- this one colored a radiant oceanic blue.  While she tried to avoid
facing her more powerful adversary directly, she used her powerful magic to
heal much of the damage that he was doing and to protect the people of the
valley from his senseless onslaught.  With their supply lines in Lithling
scattered, the Scholars of Fire were quickly driven from the north into the
swamps via the Plains of Earendam and their scattered forces in Lithling
followed them.  The liberating armies entered the valley and Shyela-Kyra led
them in a night assault against the rampaging beast, which drove him south
beyond the mountains and out of recorded history.  It is said that the
scholars spoke with her that night, and that in the morning she was gone,
but the tapestry does not show what became of her.  It is clear however,
that the locals believe that Shyela-Kyra nested somewhere in the valley, and
that they owe much of their amazing prosperity and abundance to her
continued nurturing.

along the side of the road, their sweat aroma giving the whole promenade a
somewhat pious air.  Temple Road continues east and west, while passage
south is blocked by the broad side of the trading house.  The beautiful town
temple stands north of here, its gurgling fountain can almost be glimpsed
through the intricately carved marble columns.

The Lithling Trading House~
This spacious chamber appears to be a well-stocked warehouse, partially
converted to serve as a trading station.  Boxes and crates line the walls,
stacked up to the ceiling in some places, while others are arranged as
make-shift display stands -- their wares arrayed on top of them.  The
central area of the room is occupied by a large counter made of dark pine,
an ornate abacus built into the very counter-top.  The goods themselves are
quite varied: there are the usual assortment of skins, furs and various
hunting trophies, along with mundanities such as lamps, ropes and a dozen
other items of travel it is usual to find in a general store.  Hidden away
among these are rarer items, both strange and exotic, that have found their
way into the owner\@s hands over the years.  A small sturdy-looking strongbox
stands beneath the counter, while a stout oaken door in the west wall leads
out onto Temple Road.

The River\@s Best~
This spacious store is arranged more along the lines of an open-air
market than a permanent trader.  Numerous crude and makeshift looking stands
line the walls, while clusters of boxes are stacked together to form several
more display areas throughout the chamber.  The prevalent theme of the store
is seafood.  A wide variety of marine life adorns the stands, many shapes,
colors and varieties of fish, piles of fresh-water squid and an assortment
of flat-headed eels as well as the occasional rarer delicacy.  The produce
looks fresh, but years of constant use and fish-oil fumes have left a
definite odor in the air, bordering on the sharp.  A small table stands
against the north wall, kept clear as a place for transactions, beneath
which sit a sturdy-looking strongbox.  Large double-doors in the south wall
lead out onto Lakeside Street.

Roomy and well appointed, this dwelling is a tribute to the constant flow

in fine dark wool, while the walls are decorated with simple yet elegant
tapestries.  A comfortable-looking bed stands against the west wall, an

by an impressive open fireplace, a pair of soft armchairs positioned around
it for maximum warmth.  A large writing table is set against the south wall,

The Herbaria~
This quaint little townhouse appears to have been converted into a small
store, dealing in various forms of medicinal plant life and the odd potion. 
The shelves that line the walls are veritably cluttered with a variety of
jars, small boxes and other assorted containers which presumably contain the
store\@s wares -- although far from every one is labeled.  The odd book and
small piece of apparatus are also evident, although these do not seem to be
for sale.  The far end of the musty chamber is occupied by a large lacquered
desk, serving as both workbench and counter.  A large painting hangs behind
the desk, a strange landscape painted in unusual colors.  Sitting in the
corner of the room, behind the counter you notice a sturdy-looking
strongbox.  A sturdy pine door in the east wall leads out onto Mandrake
Alley.

E
painting~
The painting shows a beautiful lush meadow out in the countryside of the
valley.  It is nighttime, the moons are out and a variety of nocturnal
animals are going about their lives.  What is strange about the picture is
both the angle and the colors.  It is painted in a mixture of rich purples
and blues, while the creatures are a variety of deep reds, and the whole
scene appears to be viewed from almost ground level.

A Spacious Home~
Roomy and well appointed, this dwelling is a tribute to the constant flow
of wealth that trade brings to this prosperous town.  The floor is carpeted
in fine dark wool, while the walls are decorated with simple yet elegant
tapestries.  A comfortable-looking bed stands against the west wall, an
ornate wardrobe built into the wall beside it.  The north wall is occupied
by an impressive open fireplace, a pair of soft armchairs positioned around
it for maximum warmth.  A large writing table is set against the south wall,
well appointed and looking much used.  The notable lack of a kitchen
indicates that the owners take most of their meals elsewhere, or have food
delivered.  An ornate pine door in the east wall leads out onto Temple Road.

carpet~
The carpet is a rich woolen shag-pile, dark brown in color and of a soft
and luxurious texture.  It appears to several skins cunningly sewn together
-- possibly mountain goat from the look of them.

tapestries~
The tapestries are expensive locally done pieces, the themes vary from
pastoral landscapes to scenes of city life from Lithling\@s history.

A Guard Tower~
This sparse but functional chamber is one of the town\@s primary rally
points in times of war.  Built up as an extension of the formidable stockade
walls, this sturdy wooden tower looks to be able to withstand all but the
most determined of siege assaults, as well as considerable magical
punishment.  A number of tables and chairs are scattered about the room, for
the inevitable games of chance, which are necessary to relieve the boredom
of sentries on duty.  A weapons rack mounted on the south wall holds the
tower\@s spare armaments, while a sturdy-looking door in the east wall leads
out into Lakeside Street.  A stout staircase stands in the northeast corner
of the room, leading up into the turret.

A Large Guard Turret~
Large and spacious, this guard turret offers ample protection from
attackers beyond the wall, providing the defenders with an excellent
position from which to repel all but the most determined of assaults.  A
raised extension of the stockade wall, the main materials appear to be
crudely finished trunks of pine, cemented together with hard-setting resin
and lashed with thick cord for extra support, terminating in pointed wooden
spikes.  Numerous arrow-slits are carved into the wall, providing narrow
glimpses of the valley below.  The palisade continues east and south through
openings carved in the walls, while a sturdy looking staircase in the
southeast corner leads down into the tower.

The Northern Palisade~
Serving as a sturdy battlement in times of attack, this wide platform
runs alongside the palisade wall to the north, a railing along the south
side preventing access to the rooves of the town below.  The clearance of
the wall varies slightly in height, from three to about five feet in some
places, terminating in pointed wooden spikes.  Beyond the wall to the north
a soft mist lies across the deceptive stillness of Lake Lithling.  The dim
blue line of the Dantaron River can be made out far to the north, while to
the east across the river, the vast brooding expanse of Lithling Forest
stretches out for miles.  The palisade continues east, while a covered guard
turret lies west, through a carved opening.
