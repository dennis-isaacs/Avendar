deer tentacled ropy aberration abdeer~
a tentacled aberration~
What appears to be a deer covered in ropy tentacles is here, shivering.
~
What stands here appears to have once been a deer, the general shape of
the body and its relatively untouched legs attesting to this.  Much of the
flesh of the thing is gone now, however, replaced by thin, ropy tentacles. 
Some of the whiplike tendrils, their color a sickly purplish-grey, bind
tight about the stricken creature, while others flail mindlessly.  While the
majority of the members end in nothing or are hidden altogether in the
tangle of flesh, odd tentacles are tipped with snapping jaws or yellow,
alien eyes.

srorsian ancient gigantic brown lizard~
the ancient srorsian~
A gigantic brown lizard lies lazily within the cave.
~
A massive, ancient specimen of the srorsian race, this brown scaled
lizard rests in its cave.  Four massive, stumpy legs support a bulky body,
its back arching into the air.  In comparison to the rest of its body, its
head is relatively small.  A pair of dull, black eyes gaze from sockets,
betraying nothing beyond an animal intelligence.  Razor teeth fill its small
mouth, more for the catching of small animals and the eating of grass than
anything else.  A thick tail tapers from its body, nearly ten feet in
length.  The docile beast looks unalertly about its cavern, blinking its
black eyes on occasion.

This abomination is vaguely reminiscent of a flea of monstrous
proportions, but only vaguely.  A pair of filth-caked mandibles chitter
wildly, brakish ooze dripping from them.  A pair of compound eyes, a solid
dull brown, are set on either side of the thing, and each of its limbs end
in a jagged looking claw.  Its entire carapace is slathered in a thick layer
of reeking filth, the odor foul, almost overpowering at times.

ibeilex small round pulpy demon~
an ibeilex~
A round, pulpy demon chitters from within its small cage.
~
This small demon resembles a flabby, misshapen ball more than anything
else.  Spindly limbs sprout from the ibeilex\@s round torso and seemingly
useless wings flap without result.  No eyes or head are visible sprouting
from its black, leathery flesh, but despite this an odd chittering persists
from it, its origin implaceable.  The doorless cage it is kept in is barely
large enough to hold it, making the thing practically immobile.

A dark-robed scholar stands idly, face set in a frown.
~
A tall, plain-looking man, this scholar is clad in dark, heavy robes. 
Brilliant green eyes are set in a disapproving face, short brown hair tops
his head and the whole of it is framed by the black cowl of his robe.  The
scholar inspects the scored pentagram at his feet idly, yet carefully.  

The back of his hands, a seemingly healthy tint of bronze, are tattooed with
black runes, appearing to be glyphs of protection.

You muddle through the shorthand and make note of the following things- 

An alatharyan ranger makes his home within and is dangerous if provoked.  A
conclave of void scholars has a tower in its northern reaches.  There is a
secret entrance into the Conclave via a waste pipe in the mountains.  There
is a secret cave with some sort of tentacled..  Monster?  Within.

walls reflecting little light.  A low depression upon the crest and a few
scattered, ancient stones suggest this place once possessed a now-forgotten
purpose.  Two broken juts of stone lean unevenly inward, a sad monument to
its creators.  A rough slope descends southward toward a mountain trail.

imagination.  The vague evidence of carving follows their outer surface,

A Cobbled Path Around the Tower~
Smooth granite cobbles form this path, winding along the edge of the
circular tower rising to the northwest.  The black stone walls of the
building reflect little light and display no windows.  The path ascends as
it continues toward the north.  Westward the cobbled path continues to
follow the curve of the tower toward its entrance.

structure stands in sharp contrast to the grays of the Mlejian range.  The
ledge overlooks a squat, domed edifice, its grays blending it with the rock
about it.  A cobbled path leads from its entrance, down the rise and
