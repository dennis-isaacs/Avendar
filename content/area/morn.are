Arik tanner man mornguardian wolfsafe~
Arik~
An old tanner sits at a bench carefully sewing a leather vest.
~
Old Arik\@s grey hair and weather beaten face belie his strong wirey form. 
His hands move quickly and accurately as they sew the newly tanned leather. 
His cold blue eyes dart from his work as you enter the room, and as you look
into them, you sense a feral spirit within this old man\@s body.

The young man doesn\@t look wholly comfortable outside the forest, even in
such a small village as Inessa.  He has come here to sell the fruits of his
hunt, and to purchase the few things he needs for his family.  He stands
here, savage looking in his crude hide clothing, expertly roasting a haunch
of venison to sell to other travellers.

A wandering peddler is here, his heavy sack weighing him down.
~
A man walks along, dressed in colourful clothing and bearing a heavy sack
on his back.  A bright blue scarf is tied around his head, and a golden
tooth glints in his mouth.  His bare feet stir up dust as he trudges along
the forest road.  Clearly of gypsy stock, this peddler is no doubt a cunning
trickster, but one never knows what wonders he might carry in his pack.

nika woman bartender waitress innkeeper mornguardian wolfsafe~
Nika~
Nika hurries around her bar, balancing a tray of full beer mugs.
~
Nika, tall and sombre, moves fluidly about her inn, making sure all of
her customers are comfortable.  She seems young, but careworn and strong
from a life of hard work.  Her dark hair is cut short, and she is dressed in
a loose shirt and leggings.  She smiles only rarely, but greets familiar
faces very warmly, and when does join in a joke with her customers, her
laugh is very catching.

builder man portly wolfsafe~
the builder~
A portly man with a greying black beard is working here.
~
A solid looking man moves about his home relaxedly.  The builder\@s gut
tells of a lifelong love of good food and wine, but his thick arms suggest a
life of hard work.  His crown of once red hair is now almost all grey,
although beneath his ruddy nose still grows a firey mustache.

a charcoal-burner~
A short, balding man is at work here.
~
This short, wiry man seems intently occupied in his duties.  A slight
frown knots this man\@s brow perpetually, and a bruskness is evident in his
voice as he talks.  A faint odor, part smokey and part sulphurous, hangs in
the air about the charcoal-burner.

The shade of a kankoran templar hovers here.
~
A faint specter of a haggard kankoran flickers here.  His tall, ethereal
form is hunched over as if being held in submission.  Thick, silvery-white
fur with patches of rust-frosted tips covers most of his body except for
several large, obvious bare spots where scars have left their marks.  A pair
of weathered, emerald eyes glow dimly in their recessed sockets and appear
to observe his surroundings with an element of bewildered confusion.

crosslegged in the middle of the floor.  A fine shaft of yew is lain across

shafts lie by his side, waiting to be fletched.

An old woodsman is here, white hair framing his thin face.

This old man looks as though he has seen many winters, and as though each
has left its mark.  His hair is the colour of snow, and his thin frame like
that of a gaunt winter tree.  He sits on a tree stump, whittling a small
figure of a young woman from a piece of oak.  Against the wall behind him
stand sturdy oaken staves and walking sticks which he has carved.

Dressed in the archaic style of aelin nobility, this sable-winged

aquiline face. Rising, chiselled cheekbones and narrow, arched 
brows grant her a somewhat austere countenance, starkly offset by 
her full, red lips and expressive mouth. When she speaks her voice 
is lilting and melodic, and her almond eyes seem to glint with an

Sparkling green eyes take in the surroundings of this young aelin girl. 
Her smooth skin is the color of burnished gold, though generously freckled
across the bridge of her nose and cheeks, and even down to her exposed
shoulders and back.  Her nose is perky, her lips full and pouty, and her
chin softly rounded.  Her hair, the color of Bronzed auburn, is cropped
short though full and feathered, exposing her curved aelin ears.  Her wings
are the color of soft gold and gleam faintly when the light catches them
just right.  Her form is slight though shapely; a sleeveless and strapless
tunic accentuates nubile curves and leggings cling to supple legs.  Her
stature is of medium height.

The snake-like body of this black-scaled drake forms a lissome \@S\@ as it

the black-fleshed Dhurzzard~
A thick pillar of black flesh and crimson flame stands here, snarling loudly.
~
A pillar of crimson flame and charred black flesh, the Dhurzzard stands
before you in a noxious cloud of thick black smoke.  Its face is twisted in
silent fury, with cold, unmoving eyes blazing with an inner anger.  Its
entire being sparks and crackles with the essence of the strength it exists
to wield, and its cold, twisted features suggest a more chilling personality
hidden behind the searing heat that flows out from around him.  Its massive
arms hold the look of ancient tree trunks, battle-scarred and flowing from
the sides of its gargantulan figure awkwardly.  Dark flesh covers its fists,
charred and peeling from the intense heat.

Zyal, Warlord of Chaigidon~
A demonic albino srryn, armour-clad and dragon-winged, stands here.
~
Zyal\@s demonic form looms above you, some nine feet in height, with
draconic wings stretched out behind him.  The albino void templar has
changed much since his death, seemingly aquiring the status of demon lord. 
His scaly hide is bone-white, and is clad in elaborate armour of crimson and
black.  His alligator muzzle is framed with a dragon skull helm, and upon
his short forearm hangs a shield of uttermost black.

A bone-thin, charcoal-scaled srryn slouches here, clad in black robes.
~
This charcoal-scaled srryn is little more than a scale-covered skeleton. 
Beady eyes peer from sunken sockets, and his flesh seems stretched over his
angular skull.  Bony hands extend from his nigh-black robes, one of them
clenched around a sacrificial dagger.

Pricina~
Pricina wraps herself in silken hair, red curls framing a flawless body.
~
Draping herself in her long red hair, dusky Pricina stands ungarbed and
seemingly vulnerable.  As she moves about, she seems to take a sort of
perverse delight in the simplest of sensations, her hands caressing
everything that comes within reach.  Stunning in her beauty, the only flaw
in her pale features are her eyes, which are marked with pupils which open
in sharp cat-like slits.

Weather-worn images are engraved into the five visible surfaces of this

stylized dragon.  A second image shows this same dragon, this time with a
group of other, smaller dragons bowing their heads toward it.  In a third
image a group of people ride upon the backs of a group of dragons, with the
large dragon leading them.  A forth image is too worn to be discerned, but
the image on the upper surface is quiet clear.  A dragon\@s face has been
carved there in deep relief.  Two holes have been bored into the block where
its eyes are, and the mouth of the dragon is also hollowed out, extending a
few inches into the rock beyond its carved teeth.

So writes the Alatharya sage Mnemestiel, \#As I gazed forth upon the 
nexus, I saw a great smoke arise from the north, and its wings were 
of flame. And from the south a cloud, which as it came flooded all 
the lands. And from the east a gale arose, as I watched it tore the 
forests and smote the hills asunder. In the wake of the devastation 
all the peoples of the world came forth to bear witness under the 
mandate of the triumvirate, and their number was ten. And the 
number of divine crystals, through which Their Mandate flows is ten, 
and the ten did hold the ten, and did channel the Mandate through 
sacrifice. But the great sacrifice cometh. As prophesised by the 
conjunction, and by its will and wish it cometh. And now as I listen, 
the cries of all the peoples of the world besought our chosen God. 
And he was with us.\#

Thus we know the conditions for the forming of the Great Houses. The 
\@ancient agreement\@ was surely a pact made between the alatharya of 
old and the \@triumvirate\@, the three ruling gods. The ten crystals 
are obvious, and those whose \@number was ten\@ can only mean one of 
each race of Avendar, to bear witness to the pact. It can only be 
assumed that the conjunction spoken of by Mnemestiel is of the seven 
greater stellar conjunctions. Such a conjunction will take place this 
very year, though I will make different use of this alignment. Perhaps 
then I will have the influence to use the following conjunction, fifty 
years later, to bring my brethren in understanding together.

quillion~
The quillions of the puzzle blade are wide, and although made of steel,
bear the likeness of twisting thorn branches, plaited together.  They
connect to the rest of the hilt through narrow slots, which seem designed to
allow the quillions to bend downwards.  
~
E
blade~
The blade of this sword is long and shapely, with a deadly edge on one
side, curving back slightly as it reaches its fine point.  Faint traceries
and runnels are apparent near the blade\@s edge, while a strange, zig-zag
pattern runs along the blade\@s blunt, inner side.  Most striking, however,
are the highly ornate quillions, grip, hand guard and pommel, whose workings
seem highly intricate.  
~
E
traceries~
Faint traceries form rune-like patterns near the puzzle blade\@s edge,
suggesting some sort of magical function.  
~
E
runnels~
Tiny grooves run from the puzzle blade\@s hilt to its edge, apparently to
allow the passage of some sort of fluid.  
~
E
pommel~
The pommel of the puzzle blade forms the likeness of a pair of lion\@s
claws gripping a large opal.  A slight abrasion where the pommel-piece
enters the grip suggests that you might be able to either pull the pommel
outward, or twist it.  
~
E
grip~
The grip of the puzzle blade is cast to fit the hand perfectly.  Two
smooth stones stud the grip near where your thumb would rest - a piece of
amber, and a sapphire.  
~
E
sapphire~
The small, blue sapphire, inset into the puzzle blade\@s grip, looks like
it is made to be pressed down.  
~
E
guard~
An ornate guard extends from the quillions to just above the pommel,
designed to protect the hand from stray blows.  The guard is formed of three
arcs of steel, in the likeness of winding briars, each seemingly plaited of
smaller steel strands.  The guard seems to be somewhat flexible, as though
it could be rotated.  
~
E
quillions~
The quillions of the puzzle blade are wide, and although made of steel,
bear the likeness of twisting thorn branches, plaited together.  They
connect to the rest of the hilt through narrow slots, which seem designed to
allow the quillions to bend downwards.  
~
E
stones~
Each of the two stones look like they are made to be pressed down.
~
E
amber~
The small, polished piece of amber, inset into the puzzle blade\@s grip,
looks like it is made to be pressed down.  
~
E
sabre~
The blade of this sword is long and shapely, with a deadly edge on one
side, curving back slightly as it reaches its fine point.  Faint traceries
and runnels are apparent near the blade\@s edge, while a strange, zig-zag
pattern runs along the blade\@s blunt, inner side.  Most striking, however,

The hilt of the puzzle blade is highly ornate.  Its quillions and hand

The hilt of this dagger is cast from red gold, in the shape of a great

grip, the wings the protective quillions, and from the carnelian-eyed head
of the dragon projects the long, thin blade of the dagger.  Three of the
dragon\@s legs, folded against its belly, grip shining stones, with the
fourth claw empty.  A small sphere of onyx, entwined by the tail, forms the
pommel.

dagger~
This intricate dagger is clearly the work of a master artisan.  Its hilt
is cast from red gold, in the shape of a great dragon in flight.  The torso
and spiralling tail of the dragon form the grip, the wings the protective
quillions, and from the carnelian-eyed head of the dragon projects the long,

belly, grip shining stones, with the fourth claw empty.  A small sphere of
onyx, entwined by the tail, forms the pommel.  
~
E
quillions~
The dragon\@s wings project from a thick ring just below the neck.  The
joint of each wing points upward towards the dagger\@s tip, before tapering
down again.  The seam of each wing is quite sturdy, and well-equipped to
deflect blows, while the golden webbing of the wings is wholly for artistic
purposes, and is carefully cast with detailed veins and scales.  The ring
from which the quillions project seems designed to allow them to be twisted
to the left or right.

A Windy Ocean Beach~
A grey and windy ocean beach stretches as far as the eye can see to the
north and south.  Eroding sandstone cliffs rise to the east, darkly framing
a stormy sky with weather-torn trees.  The wind howls across the western
ocean, and in the sky, and in the cliffs behind, and the salty smell of the
ocean rides the chill wind, hinting of teeming life beneath these cold,
sombre waves.  And below the wild moaning of the sky and the distant
screeching of gulls, echoes the everlasting sonorous roar of a tumultuous
sea.

A Path Through the Plains~
An old track winds north and south across the vast Arien Plains.  This
ill-travelled path is little more than a shallow depression in the clayish
earth, grown now with the sparse brambles and spiny tussocks which stud the
flatlands.  A pale, twisting thread, the track can be seen meandering for
miles before being engulfed in the unchanging greyness of the land.  The
plains meet the sky at the horizon far to the east and south.  To the north
and west, dark lines border plain and sky, where the great forests lie.

The Tanner\@s~
The front part of this low stone house is set up as a tanner\@s workshop. 
Piles of leather, both tanned and raw, lie around on benches.  Leather
working equipment hangs in racks on the walls, and pieces of armour and
clothing sit in various stages of completion.  The thick smell of tanned
leather surrounds you.  A door in a thin wooden wall to the south leads
through the back part of the house and to a cluttered yard.  A northern
doorway leads into the village square.

The Village Path~
A dusty path leads through the little village of Inessa.  Tall trees grow
on the side of the path and between the houses, bathing the village in
shades of red and green.  To the east, a gate hangs loosely in a tumbled
down fence, beyond which lies a forested field.  To the west stands the side
of a stone house, from which comes the rank odor of tanning leather.  To the
south the path continues, and to the north it opens into the village square.

A Cluttered Yard~
The tanner\@s yard is cluttered with all sorts of junk.  From the tanner\@s
house to the north stretches a canopy of hide across about half the yard. 
Beneath this canopy, protected from the elements, sit three large vats of
foul smelling substances.  Newly tanned leathers hang above the vats, drying
in the breeze.  Benches, tools, building materials and an overturned
wheelbarrow are scattered about haphazardly.

A Long, Winding Tunnel~
A damp tunnel winds its way down through the earth.  Tree roots and rocks
protruding from the sides snare at you as you inch your way along.  In some
places the walls seem to erupt with hundreds of worms, writhing in the air
and dropping one by one into the darkness below.

The Inn~
A large pine table stands in the middle of this part of the inn,
surrounded by a dozen chairs.  The village council sits here when important
decisions need to be made for Inessa.  Most of the time, however, people
just sit about the table eating, drinking and talking.  Others sit quietly
and watch the activity in the square through a large window in the south
wall.

A large open hearth forms much of the northern wall of this cosy corner
of the inn.  Over a brightly burning fire hangs a large black pot, from
which comes the sweet smell of mulled wine warming.  On the floor in front
of the hearth lies a huge white bearskin.  Thick and fluffy, it looks the
perfect place to cuddle up on a cold evening.

supported by a few thick beams of wood.  Several oaken barrels of varying

barrels are lidded with skins, and presumably contain foodstuffs.  Ripe
apples, grains or cheese.  Upon shelves are lined a dozen or so bottles of
wine.  A ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the center of the ceiling.

A Village Path~
A leaf littered path leads through the little village of Inessa.  Tall
trees grow on the side of the path and between the houses, bathing the
village in shades of red and green.  To the west the path leads toward a
small village square, and to the east past more houses.  A low stone house
stands to the south, while to the north is a small grassy lane.

A Grassy Lane~
A narrow grassy lane leads between two low stone houses.  On each side of
the lane stand a few tall slender birch trees.  To the north a wooden gate
fences off a small paddock, where several goats stand grazing.  Southward is
the main road through town.

The Charcoal-burner\@s House~
A low, shingled roof oppresses the otherwise well appointed interior of
this stone house.  In the center of the room a table of pine stands upon a
solid hardwood floor.  In one corner is a wide, comfortable bed, and in
another an iron stove stands amidst a well stocked kitchen.  The smell of
smoke is strong in here, particularly so nearing the wooden door which
stands in the south wall.  A similar door also stands in the north wall.

A Small Stone House~
This simple stone house holds few luxuries, but is warm, tidy and dry.  A
thatched roof holds out the rain, and a few animal skins cover the bare
earth floor.  On the eastern side of the room a large barrel stands, and
next to it is a wooden butter churn.  Next to the door in the southern wall
is a small window, under which stands a rickety wooden table with two wooden
chairs.  A half burned yellow candle stands in an iron holder on the table. 
Another wooden door hangs in a northern exit.

This large yard is cluttered with all sorts of building material.  A row
of partially completed furniture rests under a canvas against the western
fence, while against the eastern is a pile of stone blocks and wooden planks.
The planks lie partly over the fence, which is now half collapsed, allowing
a yard to the east to be entered.

sorts.  Cracked roof tiles are piled in one corner, while in another stands
a broken old butter churn.  An array of well rusted farm tools lie all about
the floor.  The shed itself leans precariously to one side.  The forest

A Young Forest~
The surrounding forest has been allowed to encroach upon this part of the
village.  Where once a yard stretched back from the stone house to the
north, now young trees grow.  An old wooden fence, all but collapsed,
surrounds the area.  Here and there a rusty farm implement lies half buried
in the rich soil.  To the west, through an old wooden gate in the tumbled
fence, lies the village path.  To the east a cleared yard lies, above which
a grey plume of smoke rises.

The Charcoal-burner\@s Yard~
From the soot-stained wall of a stone house to the north, to the
impinging oak forest to the south stretches a long muddy yard.  A spire of
thick, grey smoke rises from a structure in the center of the yard, and
breaks into a helical plume as it reached the high breezes over the village.
The occasional gust of wind down from the forest canopy sends smoke swirling
about the yard.  The source of the smoke is a high mound, built in the
center of a broad, shallow depression.  The mound is covered in earth, but
at its base the inner structure of the mound can be seen - layer upon layer
of wooden logs.  Heat radiates from the entire mound, and the wood at the
base is blackened and charred.  Against the wall of the house, beneath a
narrow shelter, hang large, bulging, burlap sacks.  A wooden door leads
north into the house.  To the west, over a tumbled down fence, the forest
has overtaken the neighbouring yard.

amongst the trees to the west is a low house of white stone.  The small
dwelling is surrounded by tilled strips of land which sprout all manner of
vegetables.

This sturdy wooden cage stands at the eastern edge of a small encampment
on the bank of the stream.  The cage has been built solid enough to hold
even the strongest of prey.  Crude shamanistic symbols are scored around the
cage to prevent escape by magical means.  Thin strips of tanned hide adorn
the walls, gruesome trophies from previous kills, and across the floor are
strewn a few bones, picked clean of flesh.  A door of thick wooden poles
leads west.

A Stormy Ocean~
Waves heave and crash about you on the surface of this vast and stormy
ocean.  To the east a grey, cliff-bound beach can be seen, but to the west
the ocean goes on forever.  Dark clouds churn above, occasionally lashing
walls of rain across the sea.  The rumble of thunder joins with the howling
wind and the roaring ocean, and the distant crying of gulls to create a
wild, tempestuous chorus.

while to the northwest the beach curves away, forming the northern boundary
of a great bay.  Waves lap at the beach, and a brisk wind stirs the sand
among the fallen branches and leaves.  To the east, a thick forest of oak
trees sways in the wind, the leaves rustling quietly on the branches.

An Ocean Shore~
A sandy beach stretches far to the north and south, forming a narrow
border between the vastness of forest and sea.  Foam-studded waves stretch
to the horizon, and crash endlessly upon the shore.  As far as the eye can
see, ribbons of dead seaweed lace the beach, their pungent decay riding the
brine-thick westerly into the forest of tea to the east.

The Ocean Shore~
Atop a low bluff, several meters above the western ocean, a thick growth
of tea trees crowds the cliff edge, making passage very difficult.  The
tree\@s gnarled roots grasp the thin, sandy soil against the blustery
westerly wind, which causes the tea forest to rattle wildly as it blows
across the canopy.  To the north the cliff rises rapidly above the ocean and
quickly becomes more rocky.

Beneath a Canvas Shelter~
The ground has been carefully cleared below an oiled canvas tarp, strung
between three small trees.  A few animal hides make a hard bed, which fills
half of the small space to the south.  Some dense shrubs make a southern
wall to the room, while reeds whistle in the wind and filter the trickling
of the stream to the west.  To the north is a small campsite.

A Cliff Overlooking the Ocean~
A high cliff face rises high above the pounding waves of a wild ocean to
the southwest.  The rock of the cliff is fractured vertically in many
places, and great columns of stone have succumb to the incessant wear of
wind and wave, and now lie tumbled on the ocean floor, or stand precarious
and alone amidst the waves.  The cliff rises to the west, but drops away to
a low bluff to the south.

An Ocean Beach~
A sandy beach stretches as far as the eye can see to the north, its
wind-rippled white sand laced with ribbons of dead seaweed.  To the south
the beach ends in a low cliff face.  Using the many fissures which score the
surface of the rock wall, the cliff may be easily climbed.  To the west the
blue-grey ocean spreads out between land and sky.  Distant gulls circle
above the waves, their harsh cries riding the cold westerly wind.  To the
east a forest of tea grows thick over the dunes.

An Ocean Shore~
A white, sandy beach stretches far away to the north, and comes to an end
at a low cliff face a little way to the south.  The great western ocean
spills its incessant breakers upon the white sand, which drops treacherously
below the surf line.  To the west a forest of tea grows thickly.  A broad
arch opens in the forest, and from the arch flows a wide stream.  The stream
spreads out across the sand, carving winding rivulets in its surface before
pouring into the surf.

A narrow path winds amongst the tall red oak and tangled alder is it

A constant chirping and twittering comes from the canopy above, and half

undergrowth.

The narrow path forms a wide curve through a forest of red oak and
tangled alder as it descends into a broad, shallow valley to the northwest,
and up over the valley\@s rim to the south.  Verdant mossy veils and
colourful toadstools cover the large grey boulders which litter the woods. 
Raucous chirping comes from the canopy above, and the occasional feathery
silhouette can be seen darting amongst the branches.

of silver, rusty red and green.  The canopy curves upward again to darker
forests several miles away.  Thin blue-grey streams of smoke rise from the
western part of the valley.  To the south the path descends through a
rolling woods of white birch, riddled with tumbling streams.

takes on a silvery sheen as white birch trees cluster upon low hillocks and
line the banks of swift rivulets which tumble their way southward.

The land here forms a tight network of shallow valleys and ridges,
channelling little rivulets into the flattening plains to the south.  The
trees grow more densely as the land rises to the north, the oak and rowan
becoming mixed with tall-growing white birch.  To the south the land drops
away, and the trees thin into scattered coppices upon the hilltops.

Approaching a Forest~
As the land rises to the north, the plains abandon their level march and
roll like great grassy dunes.  Each rounded rise is capped with small
growths of oak, smattered with red-berried rowan.  The ground grows more
rugged and forested to the north, and little rivulets flow from the higher
land, disappearing amidst reedy marshes in the shallow valleys.  To the
south the plains flatten and stretch away endlessly.

An old track winds north and south across the vast Arien Plains.  This
ill-travelled path is little more than a shallow depression in the clayish
earth, grown now with the sparse brambles and spiny tussocks which stud the
flatlands.  A pale, twisting thread, the track can be seen meandering for

A faint trail winds amongst lichen covered boulders and through gullies
and folds in the overgrown forest floor.  The oak and elm trees grow thickly
here, their tall, straight trunks wrapped in ivy.  Shadows play across the
ground as the canopy moves in the wind, and birdsong can be heard from high
above.  To the west a high bank of earth blocks passage, and to the south
thick, thorny undergrowth makes movement impossible.

ground, and many sapling trees poke timid green shoots above the carpet. 
The pine forest continues downhill to the west, but to the east it gives
gives way suddenly.  A barren outcropping of granite sees an end to this
forest.  Above the outcrop a forest of tall elm begins.

pines giving way to tea trees and brambles.  The air here is thick with the
resinous scent of the evergreens, mingled slightly with a briny smell, which
seems to ride the westerly wind.  Light filters through the canopy, dappling
the needle covered ground with motes of dark green.

The occasional pine grows tall amongst the tea, blending their resinous
scent with the smells of the ocean.  The path forms a broad dip here,
leading upward to an overgrown dune to the west and to thicker pine forests
to the east.  Little undergrowth survives in the sandy soil, with only a few
brambly shrubs and tendril-like grasses binding the earth.

into the horizon.  The sound and the smell of the sea mingles with the

their hunger upon the howling west wind.  The path descends to a sandy beach
to the west, and into the forest to the east.

building seems to serve both as a residence and as a meeting place for
villagers and travellers alike.  Several beds of soft furs line the walls,
and at the southern end of the hall stands a solid oaken table holding clay
pots and vessels.

The first sheet of papery bark on the west wall depicts a tranquil forest 
scene. A small brook flows beneath weeping pines, and a single doe stands 
drinking on the bank. A group of seven blackbirds sit on the branches of a 
lone oak atop a small hill.
 
The second westerly sheet depicts a pack of wolves leaping though the 
forest, travelling down a steep, rocky incline. The pines in this drawing 
are snow covered. A couple of human-like figures bound on all fours with 
the wolves, with wolf tails trailing from their rears.
 
In the next image a group of figures surround a small fire in the midst of 
a clearing. Men and women, as well as large wolves make up the group. The 
people are naked, and stand closer to the fire while the wolves prowl about 
the edge of the clearing.
 
The last sheet on the western wall shows a group of people dressed in furs 
and holding spears and bows. A low wooden shelter stands near them, and 
they watch as a group of wolves walk away into the darkness of the 
surrounding forest.
 
The first sheet on the eastern wall shows a man hunting. He bares a spear 
and a bow, and he is shown chasing down a huge red stag. The man is young, 
but has white hair and a long wolf\@s tail grows from his rear.
 
The next eastern sheet depicts the same man, now standing still and playing 
a small flute. An obese hag next to the man dances wildly to tune.
 
The third eastern bark sheet depicts a battle scene. The same man as shown in 
the two previous images is now lying on his back, his hands raised to cover 
his eyes. Above the man stands a huge humanoid beast, bellowing in rage, 
with hideous fangs protruding from its mouth. Next to this beast stands a 
very tall man, swinging his sword down onto the beast\@s head.
 
The last image is of a single wolf standing in the forest. The charcoal of 
the wolf\@s coat sheens silver in the dim light of the hut. A few dark lines 
cross the wolf\@s eyes, as though it were blind.

The last sheet on the western wall shows a group of people dressed in furs 
and holding spears and bows. A low wooden shelter stands near them, and 
they watch as a group of wolves walk away into the darkness of the 
surrounding forest.
 
The first sheet on the eastern wall shows a man hunting. He bares a spear 
and a bow, and he is shown chasing down a huge red stag. The man is young, 
but has white hair and a long wolf\@s tail grows from his rear.
 
The next eastern sheet depicts the same man, now standing still and playing 
a small flute. An obese hag next to the man dances wildly to tune.
 
The third eastern bark sheet depicts a battle scene. The same man as shown in 
the two previous images is now lying on his back, his hands raised to cover 
his eyes. Above the man stands a huge humanoid beast, bellowing in rage, 
with hideous fangs protruding from its mouth. Next to this beast stands a 
very tall man, swinging his sword down onto the beast\@s head.
 
The last image is of a single wolf standing in the forest. The charcoal of 
the wolf\@s coat sheens silver in the dim light of the hut. A few dark lines 
cross the wolf\@s eyes, as though it were blind.

A Leaf-Littered Path~
The path leads through a tiny village in the forest.  Small thatch roofed
log huts can be seen through the elm trees.  The air is crisp and fresh, and
the murmur and babble of the stream can be heard in the distance.  The path
continues to the south, and enters a small clearing to the west.

Ceramic pots and glass bottles filled with pungent herbs clutter every
surface of this small hut.  Parsley, fennel and rue dry on a table in the
center of the room, next to sweetly fragrant sprigs of jasmine and lavender.
Jars of hellebore and nightshade are stored safely on high shelves.  From
the rafters hang strings of garlic and ginger, and less recognisable roots
and flowers hang about the walls.  A small bed stands in the southwest
corner, next to a little fireplace hung with a black cauldron.  The only
exit seems to be the northern door.

A damp tunnel gradually descends to the west, while to the east it a
crevice drops into the darkness of the earth.  A tiny spring trickles out of

many several inches long, protrude from the walls and roof of the tunnel, or
lie drowned in the stream at the base.

A large cavern opens beneath the earth here, making a space the size of a
small room in the rocky earth.  Half way up the wall to the west is a dark
opening, and a similar egress in the ceiling can be reached by climbing the
tree roots and boulders which protrude from the walls.  Thousands of worms,
both tiny and huge, squirm in the damp earthen walls and on the floor below,
probing like damp tentacles anything which comes near them.

A Dense, Rugged Forest~
The ground is treacherous here, as it rises steeply to the north. 
Ancient oaks, their black bark covered in fungi and moss, spread their
massive limbs above you, while their buttressed roots twist amongst the
boulders and gullies of the broken forest floor.  Here and there a tall
mountain ash stands, sombre and grey in the dim light.  Evergreen thickets
of holly and juniper surround you, blocking passage to the south.

The air is heavy with the smell of decaying leaves and pungent herbs. 
Old, dark trees loom above, their ancient trunks covered in drapes of lichen

An Old, Tangled Forest~
Here the forest seems very old.  Grim, dark oaks straddle the rocky folds
of the broken forest floor, their massive, grasping limbs spreading out just
above your head.  A thick layer of decaying leaves and plants covers the
ground, filling the air with an almost intoxicating smell.  Curtains of moss
and lichen drape from the black bark of the trees, and small dark shapes
scurry in their upper limbs.  Dark leaved shrubs form dense thickets,
blocking travel eastward.  To the north and west the old forest continues,
while to the south the land drops and the forest opens slightly.

A high granite ridge thrust out from the northern hills ends in a steep

A Small Clearing~
A small clearing is here, hidden completely from the rest of the forest
by a thick line of bushes to the south, east and west.  The ground here
looks packed from the long passage of many feet.  A small fire smolders in
the center of the clearing, lighting the dark overhanging forest with a dim
flickering red glow.  To the north rises an outcropping of granite.  Small
shrubs and slender trees grow amongst the rock, making it easy to climb.  At
the base of the outcrop is a dark cave, from which comes the smell of
pungent herbs.  To the east the clearing extends, and from there comes the
sound of a trickling stream.

Here the forest seems very old.  Grim, dark oaks straddle the rocky folds

for height.  A valley rises to the north between two out thrust spurs of

but many evergreen shrubs struggle amongst the rocks. The air is clear 
here, and cold. High above you can hear the moaning of the wind in the 
canopy. Southward, the forest descends.

floor can be glimpsed.  The forest canopy reaches the level of the ridge in

A Steep, Rocky Slope~
A rocky spur from the northern hills ends here as it slopes down to the
forest southward.  Here, shallow drifts of soil cling to the granite,
allowing small shrubs and slender trees to grow upon the slope.  A clearing
extends southward on the forest floor below, and a faint flickering, as of a
tiny fire, can be seen beneath the low canopy.  To the north the ridge
rises.  There the wind moans through grey pines high above the forest floor.

A Rocky Valley~
Thorny bushes catch at your clothing as you move through this rocky
valley. Narrow spurs of granite from the northern hills rise on either
side, channeling a cold gusty wind between them.  Tall pines grow amongst
the rocks and on the high ridge, and the air is fragrant with their smell. 
To the north the valley narrows, and its end can be seen as the hill country
begins. To the south the valley descends into a forest of pine.

A Windy Ridge~
A forest of pine reaches its uppermost branches to the level of this
high, narrow ridge.  The wind buffets you and weather beaten spruce and pine
trees cling to the shallow soil.  To the east and west, the forest seems to
carve deep valleys into the northern hill country.  Valley after valley
stretch as far as the eye can see.  To the north the ridge continues, fading
into a sea of broken hills and jagged, tooth-like crests.  To the south the
ridge pierces deeper into a dark forest.

A Pine Filled Valley~
A forest of pine grows beneath a high eastern cliff face, covering the
rocky ground with needles and filling the air with a rich fragrance.  To the
northeast another high granite wall rises, channeling a cold wind from the
northern hills through this valley.  Thorny bushes grow thick between the
rocks and around the edges of the valley.  To the south a thick growth of
young pines blocks the way.

A Stark, Windy Ridge~
A stark, icy wind tears at you as it blows down from the endless
northern hills to the southern forest.  Upon the top of this granite ridge
the wind is at its fiercest, screaming weirdly through the scant foliage of
the few stunted pines and spruces which cling to the shallow soil.  Far
below the ridge lie rocky valleys, strewn with brambles and shattered
boulders.  To the south the trees grow thicker, both above and below the
ridge, until the sheer spur rises high above a deep forest.  A flattened
space in the centre of the ridge bespeaks some ancient campsite, a few sharp
spikes of stone indicating the remains of some long-destroyed structure. 
Northward, jagged ridge upon jagged ridge rise into the dark, distant massif
of the mountains.

spike spikes structure~
These spikes seem to once have formed an arch, broken in the centre now,
and the once-jagged ends worn smooth by time.  Two of these arches remain on
this flattened space, at the eastern and western ends.  While vague marks
can be felt out on the remains of the arches, time and the elements have
ensured none can be deciphered at all.  
~
E
campsite centre flattened~
There is little remaining here to mark the passage of whoever has spent
time at this place, the years of wind having ravaged it, destroying any
temporal remains.  The stone remains scorched from ancient fires, however,
and a few stones remain worn smooth, possibly once used as seats, or simply
eroded by the elements.

its way from the northern hills.  Green weeds sway back and forth beneath
the icy water, and mold and fungi cover the banks.  Trees crowd on either
side, leaning their heavy old trunks over the water and creating a tunnel
with their interlocked branches.  Twisting roots erupt from the banks and
plunge thirstily into the gushing flow. Reeds grow thickly between the trees. 
Here, the steep, crowded banks look impossible to climb.

rocky, making it impossible to climb.  The eastern bank, however, is a low,
muddy slope here and may be scrambled up by grasping the many protruding
roots.

A Stream~
A rapid stream tumbles around mossy rocks and over tiny falls as it makes
its way from the northern hills.  Green weeds sway back and forth beneath
the icy water and reeds grow thickly on the banks.  The wind hums loudly
between their stalks above the accompanying cascade of the stream.  Here the
western bank is to steep to climb, rising quickly to meet a granite spur
from the north.  To the east a similar spur ends in a cliff face just to the
north, allowing the bank to be climbed here.

A Stream~
A churning stream rushes southward from the northern hill country.  The
narrow waterway has carved its path between two high spurs of granite.  High
above, dark pines frame the sky, swaying upon the windy ridges.  Here,
however, there is no sound but the tearing of the stream as it forces its
path amongst the choking, algae-slick boulders, filling the chasm with
drenching spray.

A Boulder Strewn Embankment~
Here the ground slopes steeply to the west, from where the sound of
running water can be heard.  The boulder strewn embankment is impossible to
descend, with water-hungry trees clustering thickly between the rocks.  The
deep canopy still arches above you, and the colourful fungus is rampant as
the forest approaches the steam.  Northward, thick juniper covers the rising
ground, making travel in that direction impossible.

A Dense, Rugged Forest~
The deep canopy of this old forest arches above you, allowing only the
occasional glimmer of green light through.  Ancient bearded oaks spread out
grasping limbs, while their buttressed roots twist amongst the boulders and
gullies of the broken forest floor.  Passage on this rugged, pathless ground
is difficult, the undergrowth claws at your clothing as you move.  To the
east, a low outcropping of granite blocks passage.

Elm and birch struggle with the mighty oaks for a glimpse of the shrouded
sun.  High above, the sound of twittering birds can be heard.  Here on the
rugged forest floor all is dark and still, save for occasional rustlings in
the undergrowth.  To the west an overgrown granite outcrop blocks passage,
while to the east a thick coppice of hawthorn impedes all movement. 
Northward a low hill rises, covered in thick ivy.

A Hill in the Forest~
On this small hill, the oaks have given way to giant elm and birch trees,
and the forest is bathed in a rich green glow.  Here and there a rabbit or
squirrel will stop and watch you, before scurrying quickly into the thick
undergrowth.  Passage on this rugged, pathless ground is difficult.  Thick
nets of ivy drape from the trees and boulders, catching your clothing as you
move.

The Bank of a Stream~
A small clearing has formed here below towering elm trees.  A steep bank
leads down to the east into a rapidly flowing stream.  A well-worn furrow
cuts the bank, leading to a small beach on the edge of the stream.  Beyond
the clearing vegetation grows thickly against the stream, making travel
north or south impossible.  To the west a path leads through a forest of
elm.

A deep, narrow crevice cuts through the forest floor, channeling a stream
at its base.  The damp earth walls brush against you as you move along. 
Networks of roots protrude from both sides, making passage through the

Boulders and damp earth press in from all sides, alive with fibrous roots
and worms and crawling things.  The tunnel extends into darkness to the
east, but opens into light to the west.

A Deep Rock Gully~
A deep rocky gully cuts the forest floor here, concealed from the surface
by thick bracken and dense shrubs.  The gully continues to the west, or you
may pull yourself to the forest floor using bracken as a handhold.  A narrow
tunnel opens in the end of the gully, through which you may crawl eastward.

A Passage Through the Holly~
A tunnel-like passageway leads beneath a dense thicket of holly trees
along the edge of a deep gully.  Bracken covers the ground, hanging over the
gully\@s lip.  From here you may clamber down into the gully, or pass
westward through the holly.  To the east the thicket becomes too dense for
passage.

Here the forest opens up to the sky above, and thick green grass grows in

song of a bird comes from somewhere above.  To the north and west, boxthorn

A Cluttered Cave~
This cramped little cave seems to hold an impossible amount of stuff. 
Shelves have been built against the walls and are crammed with bottles,
books, pots and herbs.  Dried vegetables and meats hang from the roof along
side peculiar instruments of glass and metal.  It is almost impossible to
move without bumping your head on a string of garlic or an ornate lantern,
or some mobile of less obvious function.  The floor also is covered with
junk, lying in piles or spilling out of chests.  The whole cave reeks of
herbs.  A bed of straw and furs occupies a nook in the northern wall.  

An opening to the south leads out into a clearing, while to the north a
black fissure seems to scar the cave wall.

An ugly smear forms the bulk of the Scar of Gagaroth\@s inscription.  Made
from wide, thick strokes, the main part of the of the scar is a base for a
series of dangling arcs which begin on the edge of the figure.  Each of them
creeps across the surface of the ground like some sort of wound, reinforcing
the metaphor that this symbol is an actual scar.

Peering more closely at the fissure in the north wall, you realise that
it is not an opening in the mundane sense.  Rather, it appears to be a
thickly scrawled symbol of power - the Scar of Gagaroth, smeared in blood.

Staring into the symbol, you notice that its depths are more than illusory,

darker planes.  Perhaps more understanding could be gained by studying it.

As you stare into the Scar of Gagaroth, the smeared mark seems to deepen
and lengthen, as though forming a crack in the very walls of the material
plane.  It seems now that you stand at some great distance, staring at an
impossibly vast chasm spanning all of reality, cracked from its abyssal
depths to its uttermost heights.  Narrow fractures radiate from this scar in
all directions, and as your incredulous eye follows these, you find that
they join with other fissures and breaks, until you observe that the entire
boundary of reality is riddled with a jagged network of deep scars - such
that the planes of the boundary which are still smooth and unbroken appear
only as tenuous islands, barely clinging to one another.  

Shapes now seem to shift and move behind network of scars, as though
jostling for a way through the veil.  One fissure gains your focus, and your
vision races up to embrace it - impossibly deep and cold, you sense a
frantic movement from its depths.  A howling, as of a hunting beast sensing
its prey, erupts from the scar.  As the burning eyes of the demon race
toward you from those depths, you know that you are that prey.  

Suddenly you find youself in the cave once more, staring at a bloody smear
on the wall.  However the intricacies of the Scar of Gagaroth have scored
themselves indelibly on your mind.

A Tiny Camp~
A small clearing opens amongst the reeds and shrubs which cluster by the
eastern bank of the stream.  This space is completely hidden from the
outside forest by the dense growth around it and by the foliage of
overhanging trees.  A camp has been set up here.  The cold ashes of an old
fire lie in the center, and a canvas lean-to has been tied to some trees to
the south.  Several animal skins hang from trees about the clearing.  To the
east, a sturdy wooden cage sits.  The ground slopes steeply down to the
west, beyond the clearing, but thick reeds block the way to the stream.

A Hidden Clearing~
Beneath the wind-ravaged trees an old clearing lies.  The thick foliage
of the tea-tree forest forms a dome, just high enough to stand beneath, over
a flat piece of ground some ten feet wide.  The space is well protected from
the wind which can be heard howling over the tree tops above.  In the center
of the clearing stands a low, rectangular black stone, which appears to be
carved with various images.
