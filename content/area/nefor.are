Oajma the fire shaman~
Oajma the fire shaman stands next to the flame.
~
Oajma, fire shaman of the Rahh-Nefor, is a middle-aged, middle-sized
nefortu.  The brown of his leathery skin is so dark as to be almost black. 
A crimson red tattoo of a flame-wreathed claw is centered between his
eyebrows, and it stands out sharply against the dark skin.  It emphasizes
his hard features--the sharp angles of his cheeks and jaw, the bloodshot
glaring eyes, and the cruel turn of his lips.  

Originally from Kzaya Ha canyon, Oajma came to Rahh-Nefor as a youth.  Not
long after, he challenged and defeated the resident fire shaman, taking his
place.  Since then he has supported the Ajim-Chiaj in their brutality
against both the drakes and the other nefortu.  His primary duty as shaman
of the colony is to teach young nefortu the arts of fire, but he spends more
of his time trying to convince them--through object lessons--that the fire
of Bayyal is the true master.

Ulel merchant trader shopkeeper~
Ulel~
Ulel the nefortean clothing merchant vends her wares here.
~
Ulel is an elderly nefortu with deeply lined skin of pale brown hue.  She
holds herself with an air of sophistication, unlike most of her folk in
Rahh-Nefor, and she is well-dressed, her finery typical of styles that are
seen in lands far beyond the sea cavern.  Ulel\@s fashionable apparel
contrasts with her wares, simple cuts of the dull grey cloth favored by
those who prefer to avoid attention.  There are many tiny silver rings in
her pierced upper and lower lips.

A juvenile nefortu flies about the chamber.

This young nefortu is between two and three feet in height, and very much

no ring-piercings yet, unlike the majority of its elders in the sea cave. 
Its large black eyes constantly shift about and are full of poorly-concealed

the Ajim-Chiaj guard~
A nefortu templar guards the entrances to the Ajim-Chiaj hall.
~
Dressed in a dark clothes emblazoned crescent-moon motif of the
Ajim-Chiaj, this small nefortu templar hovers in place, ready to stop any
who trespass in the hall of the Ajim-Chiaj.  His eyes are an intense dark
brown, and they glimmer with enchantments for magical sight and detection. 
The flesh on his shoulders and down the visible portion of his back has been
scarred and burned.  It looks as if he has been repeatedly whipped with a
burning chain.

A slender granite drake is here.

This granite drake is rather slender, and despite its fifteen foot length
it still looks quite ferocious.  Its eyes are black and filled with hunger,
and the sound of its scales as it flaps its wings and moves about is a
soft grinding, grating noise.

Etzlawan soothsayer nefortu~
Etzlawan~
Etzlawan the soothsayer is here, gazing thoughtfully at the altar.
~
Etzlawan is a wizened, ancient nefortu, the eldest living member of the
Rahh-Nefor colony.  He has mottled brown skin that is so creased and
wrinkled that his whole appearance is one of decay and withering death.  His
wings and hands have a slight tremor, and one of his eyes is sickening milky
white.  Despite his decrepit appearance, his clear eye--a deep
brown--sparkles with willfulness and tenacity.  An unpleasant odor of
alchemical reagents surrounds him.  

Etzlawan combines crude nefortean mysticism, a smattering of Tzajai-worship,
and alchemical practices to maintain his status as soothsayer of the
sea-cave colony.  His penchant for bloody cruelty in his alchemical
experimentation is well-known, so most of the colony adults warn the young
ones away from him.  However, many will also ask Etzlawan for a roll of the
bones to help guide them in making important decisions.

tzayjal ajim-chiaj leader nefortu~
Tzayjal~
Tzayjal, leader of the Ajim-Chiaj, is here.
~
Tzayjal is a dark-skinned, surprisingly muscular nefortu.  Most of the
left side of his head is a mass of mottled red-brown burn scar tissue which
reaches partly across his face, almost to the small pug nose.  A small
protuberance of scar formerly an ear bears a single polished black ring. 
Tzayjal\@s eyes glare, dark and baleful, a perfect match to his customary
sneer.  The enamel of his upper canine teeth has been stained a permanent
flame red, making them stand out nearly as pronouncedly as the scarring.  

Once a rising star of the Earendam\@s Company of the Jackal, Tzayjal became
increasingly involved in the Company\@s politics--until he was commanded to
lead a Company action against a ravaging Flame Dragon.  Terribly wounded by
the dragon after his fellows suspiciously retreated without him, he was sent
back to Rahh-Nefor to convalesce.  Tzayjal saw no reason to return to the
Jackal, once he became aware that he could strong-arm his way to dominance
of the Sea-Cave, whipping lesser nefortu into action against the drakes and
supporting himself well through the \#voluntary\# contributions of the
citizens.

Jiyko the mist shaman~
Jiyko the mist shaman stands here, surrounded by a light haze.
~
Jiyko, mist shaman of the Rahh-Nefor, has earth-brown hairless skin which
is slightly wrinkled at the joints and along his bony forehead.  The
membrane of wings from his arms to torso seems rather thin and atrophied,
and it is pierced by a tangle of fine silver cords strung with feathers,
small sparkling rings, and brightly colored beads.  His eyes are full of
mischief, though the rest of his face is more grim than playful.  

As the mist shaman of the sea-cave colony, Jiyko has two official duties:
aiding the defense of the colony when it is threatened, and helping juvenile
nefortu when they begin learning to fly, using his magics of both air and
water to assist early flight and mend the occasional broken wing.  But as a
practical matter, Jiyko is much better known and valued by all Rahh-Nefor
for his entertaining stories, brought to life by his ventriloquism and
illusions.  And like the other shamans of the colony, the recompense for
Jiyko\@s service is free food, drink, dwelling, the regard and attention of
females, and the use of several personal servants.

Kalilaqa~
Kalilaqa, matron of Rahh-Nefor, is perched here.
~
This old nefortean female has as her charge the care of all the young
nefortu in the colony.  She has wrinkled, dark leathery skin, slightly
glazed eyes, and an impressive collection of pale scars.  Most of the scars
appear to be from old injuries from her younger days--but there are some
newer-looking marks as well, testifying to the nastiness of the pranks and
misdeeds of her charges.  She is mostly toothless, and her limbs and
wing-arms are thin but not frail.

Lanoqij~
Lanoqij the nefortean ring merchant models his merchandise.
~
Lanoqij has soft brown skin and a keen contemplative eye.  His nails are
manicured to perfection, but there are calluses on his brown hands.  Older
than most nefortu, he has managed to keep his age from showing except for
around his eyes, where the leathery skin wrinkles into deep, crack-like
furrows.  Making a tidy profit catering to the Rahh-Nefor fetish for rings,
he wears all of his goods to display their fit and utility.

Meran Middins is a middle-aged human, with streaks of gray in the
otherwise thick long black hair of her head.  Her face is beautiful by most
standards, despite a sterness that has set in with permanent lines and
wrinkles.  

Once a fixture of the Var Bandor underworld, she parted ways to set up her
own group of bandits in Rahh-Nefor.  Specializing in abductions and ransoms,
Meran and her group make more than enough to pay the occasional Ajim Chiaj
\#tax\# and support a fine, if secluded, lifestyle in the sea-cave.

You stand upon a barren hillside, alone save for a war-banner of plain silver-gray.
You reach towards the banner-pole to take it up, but find it too heavy to lift.
Mustering all of your strength, you at last raise it high.  Light shines around you.
The burden of its weight nearly causes you to fall. You attempt to set it down.
Your hands have become grafted onto the banner!  You cannot let go of it!
Stumbling awkwardly, you trip and fall, struggling to keep the banner aloft.
You cannot keep it raised, and at last the gray ensign touches the soil.
The ensign sinks through the earth, as if in quicksand--and it begins to draw you down with it!

You are standing on a high, stony precipice, a band of imposing companions behind you.

Cheers and victorious cries ring out from your companions.
You reach down, and from a crack in the stone, pluck out a solitary flower.
A suddenly wind whips around you, and you feel...odd.  Light.  You begin to glow.
Rising up into the air, you survey the scene as if from another\@s eyes.  Your companions drop to a knee.
You hang suspended in mid-air, and suddenly lightning flashes.  You experience pain greater than any you\@ve ever felt before.

>data_prog 1~
In your dream, you rest at the altar of balance in the temple of Var Bandor.
The altar begins to hum lightly, dispersing the fine layer of dust upon it.
Lines of glowing silver begin to move along its surface, writing out runes and symbols.
You approach the altar and reach down a hand to touch a large symbol, the triangled eye.
Within the triangle, the eye turns, focusing upon you. The air hums with unseen energy.
Under the gaze of the eye, a dual sense of peace and purpose begins to swell within you.
The glowing runes suddenly fade, and you feel a sharp pain where you touched the altar.
You look at your hand. Your fingers are cut and bleeding. Crimson drops stain the altar.

two~
I spoke with various nefortu to information about the folk here:  a 
merchant, a few drunks at in the common area up in the stalactites, and an
old fellow who demanded 50 gold before he would say a word.  Everyone else
just sneered when I approached them.  Well, if 50 gold were always the
price of knowledge, we Seekers would be poor but happy.

  The Nefortu call this vast sea cavern Rahh-Nefor.  In their language, it
means, simply enough, \@The Nefortu Sea\@, and designates both the particular
colony of nefortu, and this gigantic sea-cavern.

  The Rahh-Nefor have ongoing conflict with the granite drakes that roost
in the southern area of the cave in a giant crevice.  The drakes primarily
feed on fish, a drunk told me, but then he showed me a nasty scar and told
me that they didn\@t think twice about eating a slow nefortu.  I don\@t 
doubt the drunk was very lucky in his encounter.

  The following pages detail the information I\@ve collected thusfar.
~
E
three~
When I asked about their leadership, I got sneers and chuckles in
response.  I did manage to find out from the old fellow that there is no
official authority, nor formal rule of law, as one would find in a more
advanced society.  However, there several primary figures in the nefortu
colony: the leader of the Ajim-Chiaj, a group of templars who lead the 
fight against the drakes; the soothsayer, a primitve alchemist who is the
closest thing the colony has to a priest; an air shaman and a fire shaman,
who each perform a particular role in the colony; and the matron, the
oldest nefortu female, who has the responsibility to care for the young
(and, if I am told correctly, is well-paid to put up with them!).

  Other than that, the civilization is quite unstructured, bound together
by old tradition, mutual distrust, and common business interest.

  Several of them were angry at the Ajim-Chiaj, and one old fellow told 
me (after looking around to see that we were alone) they were worse than
the drakes--they force a \#protection tax\# on the colony. He said they 
could eradicate the drakes whenever they wanted, but colony wouldn\@t long
stand for their strong-arming and harrassment without their also helping
to occasionally push the drakes to the southern ends of the sea-cave.
~
E
four~
Regarding diet, the Rahh-Nefor, like the drakes, feed primarily on fish
and seaweed found in the large sea below their dwellings.  They do have
steady trade and regular merchant visitors, and so have developed a taste
for foreign food, though they prefer fish above all else. 

  Regarding clothing, they are quite aware of the styles and events up
on the surface world. They import much of their clothing and styles are
generally influenced by Var Bandorian pan-Avendarian sensibilities. However,
they do have a fascination with rings and piercings--ear rings, nose rings,
wing rings, even toe rings! The most successful merchant in the cavern is
the ring trader.
~
E
five~
Regarding language, they speak the tongue common to all of their race,
but have developed particular proverbs and idioms. I offered a gold per
expression, in the tavern, and had to stop eventually as it became clear 
they were making them up on the spot. But the following are those which
seemed most genuine, along with the interpretations they gave me.


Proverbs 

- Dice, not stars, are faithful.            (trust to luck over fate, gods)
- The sharpest sword cuts best.             (skill, not size, matters)
- Not every light\@s the cave entrance.      (don\@t be duped by shiny goods)
- Every worm has its hole.                  (always have a back-up plan)
- Alatharya have thick fingers.             (good thieves must be clever)
- Today\@s fire won\@t smoke tomorrow\@s fish. (think long-term for profit)
- The mouth that always talks never eats.   (don\@t give away secrets)
- Verdah are philosophers.                  (idle thinking brings no profit)
  

Idioms -- as they don\@t often translate well, my definitions are approximate.

- A coin has two faces.                     (luck, bad or good, will change)
- trade gold for copper                     (to be drunk or crazy)
- have seven rings and nine scars           (to not learn from experience)
- be perched on a pike                      (be in a dangerous situation)
- to eat ash with Bayyal                    (negative but just consequence)
- a Tzajai gift                             (a mixed blessing)
- flap your arms                            (do something the wrong way)
- haggle with rings in your tongue          (be an unskilled trader)
- unsmoked fish                             (plain, bland, boring, innocent)
- to have one\@s spikes pointed inward       (to be the worst sort of stupid)
~
E
six~
\#ayzal\# (luck charm): a ritualistic behavior performed to bring good luck.
This is like the warriors of my homeland who always eat the same meal before
battle, or refuse to wash their underclothes after a victory. Absolutely
disgusting! 

Some of the nefortu spend a great amount of time considering what might 
have contributed to their good luck, and then repeating the circumstances. 
They\@ll also avoid circumstances connected with past bad luck.


\#ayyth\# (luck sign): many nefortu eventually settle on not only a lucky
number, but a lucky day/month, lucky metal, lucky animal, and all manner of
other signs of luck. A nefortu may have hundreds of ayyths to consider 
before making decisions.


\#ntul jial\# (parental debt): parents in the sea-cave make a small profit
on offspring because offspring are required to pay off a \#parental debt\#
and cannot keep money for themselves until they have done so. Parents use
this money to pay the nefortu who handle the communal childcare, and they
pocket a small profit besides (the whole point of having children, or why
bother, one fellow told me!).

Adolescent nefortu of Rahh-Nefor make it a priority to trade/steal/do 
whatever they can to get the coin to pay off the parental debt, and aren\@t
considered adult until they have done so. Many nefortu have a \#Yaye Kiyn\#
(wind money), orcoming of age party when the last of ntul jial is paid. 
These parties are infamous for involving much drink and naughtiness.
~
E
seven~
\#jwaol\# (memory ring): Nefortu of Rahh-Nefor will often get a new piercing 
and a new ring to commemorate a special event or other significant 
experience.  These rings are usually worn in the ears, on the nose, or
lips, but could be--and are--put anywhere.


\#aychalqa (luck bones)\#: consulting a shaman, who will roll bones or 
consult bloodspatter to determine answers to questions or to help make
important decisions. If far from access to a shaman, rolling dice
or tossing a coin for onesself is considered less lucky but still 
better than nothing.
~
E
one~
10 o\@clock pm, Lyrensday, 10th day of Kyanamir
After considerable discussion, Pohe, Gylion, and I finally conviced Gwyd
to join us on a venture to the far-off caverns of the Rahh-Nefor.  I had
enlisted Pohe and Gylion, long-time travelling companions, quite easily
as they are never ones to turn down the chance to explore a new corner of
Avendar. We set out in morning. The reports of this venture will be sure
to make a fine presentation for the Assembly!


7 o\@clock pm, Iolenday, 11th day of Kyanamir
According to the directions I obtained from a portly merchant who spoke
to us of the caves a few days ago, we followed south and west along
the Dantaron.  We used the first of our supply of flight potions to
get over the huge waterfall that spills from the mountain lake that is
the source of the Dantaron. The beauty of the falls and the mountain lake
requires a bard\@s tongue to do it justice.  We camped on the west shore
of the lake, where the dark tunnel leading to Rahh-Nefor begins.  Gwyd
had been a bit melancholy--like most rangers, he is a man of the open
spaces, and despises deep, dark caverns.  He has been suffering from a
cold as well. A fine-looking mountain hawk that lives on the lake\@s edge
has been speaking with him
 perhaps his animal friend will acompany us
and help cheer him up.


11 o\@clock pm, Thelansday, 12th day of Kyanamir
The descent through the tunnels was a testament as to why this place is
so little-known on the surface.  Vertical drops through thin shafts of
stone, an aggressive formation of eslingalis, species verdithius (common
name-verdah slime), and dangerous blasts of wind through a narrow
lava vent kept us on our toes.  Once into the great cavern, we spent
most of the day scouting around the southern half of the sea, finding
little more than fish and the neforteans who fished for them.

Tragedy struck our group today shortly after making camp around 7 pm.
We had stopped in a cavern, nearly hidden in a recess on a narrow
ledge along the western side of the lake. Before we had even set up watch,
we were attacked by a small granite drake.  Gylion was slain--alas that
we brought no water scholar--before we could wound the drake and drive
it away.  I created a small tremor to hide the cavern entrance with
rubble and boulders, lest the drake return to feed on our friend\@s corpse. 
  
Though we are all quite sad over the loss of Gylion, Pohe is in a fury.
He vows to see how well the drakes fight a prepared group.  Tomorrow,
I\@m sure he\@ll have ample opportunity to fulfill the vow, as we explore the
northern half of the sea and the lower air levels, and I attempt to glean
information about this place from its residents.

riddle~
The words of the scroll, an ancient codex,
are written in blood.
 
In darke of night when stars align,
the evil stirs, the shadows stare.
A ripple spreads across the voide,
The Lord of Ancient Evils\@ lair.
To call the Lord from his repose,
The Yldere Recype of Zyrn:
The sparkling tears of icy stars,
A draughte of red-golde wyne of wyrm,
A hingeless box grey-stoned in hue,
The death-tooth of the footless one,  
A lady captured in the stone,  
The greens of verdant terror\@s home.
These things once gathered, summon forthe
Lord Lraj Halsith, to vex the eorthe.

They clatter outside.  My men and the last of the Thrantians are now on
the foredeck, and they have set fire to the main deck to keep the demons
off.  Desperate, but it was my emergency strategy.  

Now, in the light of the fire, I see reflected in the maelstrom, the Gate. 
A shuddeni is near a lake, his spiral drawn in river mud.  I wonder if gazes
out into the darkness, to see ...  Us?  

Borandus calls out words of power, and they are the sweetest words anyone
has ever spoken.  The demons jeer and cackle, slightly diminished by the
spell.  

But then, I see my crew cry out.  SHE arises from the depths.  Bahhaoth,
Borandus names her, blackest ooze shaped into an impossibly horrible female
form.  She reaches for the ship, and I know she reaches out to pull it back.

Darkness, Thirtieth Entry:

[This last entry in a hurried, crabbed hand, as if written in an enormous
hurry.  ] 

This will likely be my last entry.  We have found the gate, and now, the
Ilal heads directly into the maw of the largest whirlpool I have seen in my
waking life.  

As soon as the scholars began the incantation to make it, the seas began to
boil with activity.  Wave after wave of demon and undead emerged, their
sickly slurping a dark chorus to our work.  

The Thrantian warriors pushed them back again and again, while my men and I
backed them up.  I had them light the last of our torches -- if this does
not work, we will have no need of them.  The doppelgangers came next, and
were almost successful -- one took my place, and was directing the crew to
attack themselves.  

The first part of the casting was done, and a dark eye opened in the water. 


Now, I am at the wheel of the ship, in the wheelhouse near the middle of the
deck.  I write this as we turn and move toward the whirlpool.  Skeletons are
thick about the structure, but I have an old rune I bought several trips ago
to lock the door.

Darkness, Twenty-ninth entry:

[Large ink blotch] We have found a gate which is opening.  We are heading
there with all speed.  Borandus says we will make it in time.  The stench
from the sea is thicker now, and the air is expectant.  I cannot sleep as
[incomprehensible] waits for me in my sleep.  I will be ready.

\\\#If we expend this much magical energy in one place, it will almost
certainly draw the attention of the denizens of the plane.  If we have
escaped the Queen\@s notice so far, she will certainly know we are here as we
make our escape.  When we are ready, you must prepare the men for combat. 
We may have to fight our way out.\#  

I put my hand on my sword, nodded, and left them to finalize their plans.  
~
E
pagenineteen~
\\\#The second problem is the fly in our ointment.  These portals, when they
open, are designed to call forth a demon.  But here, in this dark place, all
the demons dwell below the surface of this foul sea.  

In retrospect, your insistence on air scholars may be our salvation.  

When we find a gate, the air scholars will blast the sea with air, making a
whirlpool.  We must sail the Ilal into the maw of the maelstrom, and I will
call forth to the seas as we reach the gate.  The oceans will touch the
veil, and I will cast my spell a second time.  If the gods smile, we will be
transported from this prison.  

If we fail, we will end our lives buried in the Dead Sea, but I can see no
other fate for us than slow starvation as we sail mindlessly under that
maddening red Eye.\#  

I agreed immediately.  Could it be any other way?  

Borandus grinned, \#I thought you might see it that way.  There is one more
potential..  Ah..  Pitfall.\#  
~
E
pageeighteen~
\\\#Get to the point!\#, shouted one of the air scholars.  

Yes, as I was saying.  We do not possess the resources or the wherewithal to
open our own gate through the Veil.  However, any scholar of the void opens
a weakness, or a tear in the Veil whenever he or she conjures a demon.  I am
certain that this place is home to some of the demons that those dark
sorcerers draw from -- your experience with the doppelganger in the hold
proves that.  

That means that, periodically, gates from Avendar to this place, the Dead
Sea, must open.  It is theoretically possible that we could use these holes,
or gates, or bridges, or what have you to escape from here.  

There are several problems, however.  

Firstly, there is the matter of finding the gate when it opens.  We have
discussed mechanisms for finding this, and I believe the air scholars and I
have found a way.  Our magic (as, indeed, all elemental magic other than
negation) is slightly less strong here, on the Void.  

As the boundary between our two planes softens, we should detect our magic
becoming imperceptibly stronger.  We need only follow the path of greatest
strength.\#

Darkness, Tweny-Sixth Entry:

Today, there is hope.  Borandus and the scholars invited me into my cabin,
and laid out what they think could be a plan.  

Borandus assumed his lecturing tone, which I have become all too familiar
with in recent days.  

\#As you may or may not be aware, Avendar and the Void are separated by a
border region, what demonologists refer to as \@The Silver Veil\@.  This
thing, this structure, prevents free travel from the Void to our own world. 


It can be bypassed, of course, if sufficient magical energy is used to
travel to another plane (very difficult in the negative energy well that is
the void), or to open a hole in the Veil.  

It\@s something of a mystery how the Veil was constructed -- some say the
gods placed it there, to save the world from ruin.  Others maintain it\@s a
natural phenomena, a natural membrane between worlds.  Yet others believe
that it was created by the alatharya, who wanted more control over
demonkind, and created a planar artifact of ancient magic.  And the scholar
Akkarlis writes that...\#

Darkness, Twenty-fifth Entry:

They found my first mate, swinging from the yard arm where he had hung
himself.  I cut him down myself, as I had too much respect for the man to
see anyone else do it.  

I wondered what to do with the body -- I didn\@t have the heart to toss it
into the foul darkness over the edge of the boat.  Borandus offered to dry
the body out by draining the water, so we could store it in a makeshift
coffin (a crate, really) without the smell.  

As we were getting a crate from the store room where that accursed void
scholar had cast his spell, Borandus saw the remaining trappings of the
ritual and cried out,

\#Of course!  I have it!\#  

And with that, he and three of the air scholars locked himself in my cabin,
excitedly discussing something.  

Disgruntled, I wrote this, and rested in my mate\@s cabin.  A little morbid,
but I\@m not fool enough to sleep on deck in this place.  
~

Darkness, Twenty-third Entry:

Another attack by the denizens of this place.  Only one casualty this time,
but I can see the light in the men\@s eyes die a little more each day.  They
wonder why they are fighting this fight, when a cleaner death would come at
the hands of their own blades.  
~
E
pagefourteen~
\\\#Can you not simply meld us into this sea, and take us home that way?\#  

I have already tried.  What we are on is not water.  And even if we could,
we are on the wrong the side of the Veil.  I do not have the magics required
to open it.  

Captain, I can only offer my humblest apologies for damning both you and
your crew.  I can see no way out of this dark place.  Tell your men what you
will, and I will aid you against however I can, but I recommend you make
your peace with the gods now.\#  

Before we slept that night, I called the men together, and told them what
Borandus had revealed.  Frankly, I felt that if we were to die, they
deserved the truth.  And, all told, they took it fairly well.  I think some
of them suspected that we were no longer in Avendar, and we had fought
demons in this place.  A few paled, and one of the youngest fainted, but on
the whole there was grim silence.  

Really, I could see no possibility of mutiny here, in this place.  What
would they do with the ship?  Where would they go, or do that we weren\@t not
already trying?  No, my deepest fear was the despair it might have on my
shipmates.  
~
E
pagethirteen~
I will forever remember the cold dread in Boranthus\@ voice.  

Captain, we are not underground, in some great moat of the shuddeni.  If
that were so...  If only that were so.  

Captain, where we are is barely a place at all.  

For we are in the Void.  

This ship, your crew, we all..  We are sailing across the Dead Sea, the Sea
that is Not.  We sail across the ichors of death and decay, in which no
living thing can grow.  

Overhead, that star in the sky.  It is no star.  It is the Eye of Bahhaoth,
queen of this place.  It gazes down, uncaring, on the unlife and
abominations of the Sea.  

You could sail for ten eternities, and not reach the edge of this place.  

I ..  I did not anticipate an acolyte of the void to attempt a potent spell
just as I cast.  The touch of the Void upon my magic twisted it.  Rather
than melding to another spot on the ocean, it took us to the closest thing
to an ocean...  Here in the Void.\#  

There were some moments of pregnant silence, as the news wormed its way into
my head.

Darkness, Seventeenth Entry

Borandus is awake and about on his feet now, although, in my heart, I almost
rue his return now that I know the Truth.  

Borandus progressed rapidly in healing himself yesterday, using his magic to
help himself recover quickly.  He complained of the magic seeming sluggish,
almost weaker than it ought to be, but at first ascribed this as being a
result of the psychic trauma.  

When I took him out of my cabin, and showed him the place we were in, he
very nearly collapsed again.  He staggered, and the look on his face...  It
showed more pain than at any time when he had lain comatose.  

He motioned me back into the cabin, and told me ...  Something I can barely
put words to...  [here, the pen of the captain obviously trembles, and there
is another large inkblot.]

The creatures seemed to flee from fire, or at least, displayed some small
aversion to the light it shed, and that helped us in finally putting paid to
them.  The fight ended, and most of us returned to our quarters, but I kept
a double watch.  

I think that it helped the men to have something to do other than fret and
bellyache, but...  I have already seen the cold fear in some of the eyes of
the younger seamen.  The things we fought tonight were not like anything I\@d
ever seen.  

I cannot voice my true suspicion yet.  It is too horrible, and it would kill
all hope in the men.

Darkness, Fifteenth entry

They attacked while most of us were sleeping.  It was against reason, but I
have kept burning our scant supply of torches each time the men were on
guard.  Call it luck, divine favor, or just cussedness on my part, but my
men saw the things when they emerged from the murk, and started clamber up
onto the ship.  

Some of them were lumps of goo, with mortal faces.  They cursed at us,
spitting a viscous poison at my men.  There were skeletons, covered with the
black waters of the sea, who clutched and clawed at the side of the ship,
dragging men down beneath the waters.  Finally, and most frighteningly,
there were doppelgangers, each of which took the form and abilities of one
of the defenders.  

It was not the hardest fight that I have ever faced, but I certainly have
never seen one more chilling.  I watched Hajja slash through the blobs with
his blades, and tripping an opponent who looked exactly like him off the aft
of the ship.  Then, as I was locked in combat with a half dozen skeletons, I
was forced to watch as two of my best men were dissolved and devoured by the
blobs.

...Morale is lower than ever.  This is my tenth entry since the darkness,
and there seems to be no change.  Rather than let fear seize the crew, I let
one of the air scholars spread his theory that we are in some deep
underground sea, and the red light is a clump of fungus.  I told them to
keep watch for signs of shuddeni, thinking an enemy the men were familiar
with might steel them.  

Borandus still lies unconscious, but his breathing is lighter now.  If he
awakens, perhaps his magic can ...  No, it is best not to garner false
hopes.  

I have a suspicion about our fate, but I will not voice it.

Darkness, Third Entry

The first thing I did when I awoke was to puzzle through the parchments I
found on the recently departed \#crewman\#.  Some of the scrolls were
obviously spells -- meaningless mystical scribblings to me, but I could see
that Kantru was no true sailor -- he was at least a journeyman scholar. 
More troubling, I found a scrap of a letter, from Kantru to a merchant in
Earendam of the name of Bahand.  

Kantru promised in the letter that, \#the captain will meet his doppelganger
and be dealt with before we next meet.  I expect payment in the usual
location.\#  Bahand is the leader of a small consortium of merchants in
Earendam I refused to trade with because I felt their prices were
exorbitant.  

I can only suppose that the creature Kantru summoned was this doppelganger,
only his spell had gone drastically wrong.  If it was his summoning which
disrupted Borandus\@ spell, then perhaps it cuts both ways, and he met a
horrible end at the hands of the demon he sought to bind with his own blood.


The rest of the day was relatively uneventful.  As far as I could tell, we
made no real progress in any direction, but it\@s hard to tell, owing to the
lack of landmarks and the fact that the accursed red star never moves a
degree.  

As I write this, there is little more to report than Borandus still lies
sleeping.  We poured water down his throat, but there was little more that
could be done.  

[At this point in the log, several pages have been ripped, and the next
entry is fragmentary] 

~
E
pagesix~
After we had moved aside what little remained of its body, we were free
to examine the room.  The crewman, a human of the name of Kantru, had
obviously been using this room as some sort of crude magical laboratory.  A
few scrolls and notes were open on crates near the center of the room, where
an odd spiral shape had been painted in his own blood on the floor.  His
body, or what was left of it, had been dead for some hours.  

It was the air scholar who set me onto this line of thought, and I can\@t put
it out of my head now.  

\#What if,\# he said, in that pedantic tone scholars use, \#This wretch were
trying to conjure a demon while Borandus was casting his spell?  Could that
have set us awry?\#  

I took several scrolls from Kantru\@s tunic, and ordered the men to throw the
body overboard.  He doesn\@t deserve a grave in the sea, as the gods alone
know what he was really doing in my ship.  

After posting guards, I went back to my cabin to sleep and to write this, if
only to organize my thoughts.

Darkness, Second Entry

I awoke in the night to a scream of absolute horror.  I rushed out of my
cabin, sword in hand.  A goodly number of the crew were gatHered around a
storage hold.  We opened the door, and 

[Here, the ink is blotted as if the captain stopped for too long with pen to
page] 

and one of the new men I\@d taken on board in Earendam was there,
eviscerated.  A ghastly caricature of the man had part of his face and
skull, and was busy implanting the grisly totem into a blob of blackish goo.
The crewman\@s body dangled upside down in the room, its blood drained into a
brackish pool in an obsidian bowl placed below it.  

The thing..  The doppelganger screeched at us, and leaped at me.  I slashed
at it, in a futile effort to drive it back.  It grew claws, and sliced at my
throat.  I stepped back, just as one of the air scholars arrived, and
blasted the thing with lightning.  It hit one of the torches on the wall,
and caught fire almost immediately.  It yelled and screeched with its eerie
keening, and within just a few minutes was consumed.  
~
E
pagefour~
As I write this now, we still have no idea where the ship is, I can still
make no reckoning that will locate us.  The sky is utterly dark, save for a
single red star far in the north.  There is not a trace of wind, and the air
is stale and foul.  

I had the men light torches on the deck, and that is when we made our most
disturbing discovery.  We float on a sea of some black liquid, slightly
thicker than water and with none of its wholesome properties.  It is
probably the source of the foulness of the air, and it reeks of
putrefaction.  We tried sounding the depths with our anchor, but could find
no bottom.  

Lacking any sign of land, I instructed the air scholars to generate wind for
the sails, and set course in the direction of the red star.  Borandus is
comatose, so I have set him up in my own bed, as it is all we can do.  

There is no rising or setting of the sun here, and even the red star is
listless and unchanging in the sky.  I end this log entry by candle as I
prepare to sleep, all frame of reference lost.

Evenday, the Thirteenth of Kyanamir

I...  Words cannot begin to describe what has befallen the fate of my ship
and my crew, but I must record it, if only that I might not believe it
ourselves if I did not take a written record.  

The day dawned, and Borandus made preparations for casting the spell.  He
bid the air scholars to cease their magics, concerned that their be no other
form of magical interference.  He stood on the foredeck, and cast his spell.
His voice rose and fell as part of some high chant, and a living warmth
swept through the ship.  

The mighty spell took hold, and I could feel the entire ship beginning to
flow into the ocean....  And then there was a horrible, deadly wrenching. 
Every part of me cried out in agony.  Like a thousand nettles, all jabbed
into the soft parts of your body.  

Most all of us collapsed, some for hours, others, for a few moment. 
Borandus lay slumped on the foredeck, blood trickling from his ears.

Thethelsday, the Thirteenth of Kyanamir

We departed Earendam today, leaving the city\@s docks on the Dantaron. 
Thanks to the presence of the air scholars, we made on our northeasterly
course with all speed.  Borandus tells us that we must be sufficiently far
from land for the spell to work, and I intend to oblige him.  

Nothing else of note, except that we have reached our destination by
nightfall.  I had an excellent dinner in my quarters with Borandus and
Hajja, the head of the warriors from the Thrantian school.  Hajja is a keen
hand with his blade, and Borandus knows the ocean currents as well as any
captain I\@ve known.  If his magic is as good as his gold and his sea lore, I
expect to be sipping Gaald ale by sunset tomorrow.

Nimansday, the Twelfth of Kyanamir

...Borandus is the name of the scholar who wants to try the experiment.  He
claims that he has perfected a new version of the \@Meld with Water\@ spell
that can move far more than just a handful of people -- he claims it can
move an entire ship and its contents!  

Most captains would scoff at the notion, but I own the Ilal today because I
was willing to take risks.  And, unlike many of the other daft sea dogs who
ply the Uthlin, I don\@t have any superstitions about Iandir-knows-what
dragging my ship under the waves for trafficking with scholars.  

The fellow seems to have ties to the Tower, or at least, is independently
wealthy as well.  When I expressed concerned about ending up in mid-air, or
even parts unknown, Borandus provided gold to hire air scholars (I once had
to transport the ship overland this way -- expensive, but effective) and a
contingent of warriors from the Thrantian school.  For myself, I made sure
we had extra supplies, and got a half dozen more sailing men to replace the
ones who\@d left after the last long voyage.  The test is scheduled two days
from now, and Borandus wants to sail from Uthlin to the Lidraeu, some
distance off the shore of Gaald.  It\@s a long shot, but I\@ve taken a cargo
of fine silks and Lithling wine on board.  Even if we don\@t make it to
Gaald, there\@s always a demand for the finer things eastward along the
Uthlin.

a jar of spicy eel paste~
A tightly-sealed jar of yellow-orange paste sits on the ground.~
Eel paste is prized in Rahh-Nefor for its pungent, salty flavor, used as
an additive in soups, sauces, and as a spread.  The process for creating eel
paste is notoriously involved, starting with meticulously filleting the eel,
preserving the liver, brain, and blood, and smoking the meat.  Then the meat
and organs are placed in a wooden contraption much like a wine press, where
they are fermented with herbs and spices for twenty days.  Those more
steeped in the nefortu traditions will insist that eel paste only tastes
correct if the paste is constantly held close to the body during the
fermenting process.  \#Idkilha\# slings (loosely translated, \@body-close\@) are
still made by older generations for this purpose.  This custom extends so
far as sleeping with the maturing product.  After fermentation, the eel
paste is sealed in jars and aged for several more months before consumption.

A buoyant hammock of grey silk hangs magically in the air.~
The famed nefortean air mage, Jiyko, is said to have invented the buoyant
hammock between his other duties, including the telling stories, and the
enjoyment of food, drink, and women.  Hammocks are prized items among
cave-dwelling nefortu, because of their ease of hanging and casual comfort. 
A magical one, such as this, would offer the traveling nefortu the pleasures
of home without the meddlesome necessities of actually working, or anything
from which to hang it.

a tiny floating dirk~
A tiny dirk of steel floats in the air.~
The story of the floating dirk is intertwined with the folly of Noljech,
an incompetent but devious nefortean assassin.  After attempt after failed
attempt to assassinate a Bandorian merchant, Noljech devised a plan: he
would beseech Tzajai the Jester, and convince him to make him into the
greatest assassin in Avendar.  

By some odd stroke of chance, Noljech managed to get the attention of
Tzajai, who told him that whoever could beat him in a game of hide and seek
would be rewarded.  Noljech quickly agreed, and searched high and low for
the hiding place of the Jester.  He traveled to the far corners of the world
in pursuit, only to turn up empty-handed.  

Finally, in despair, Noljech flew to the top of Mount Khorak.  He let out a
loud, frustrated cry, and flung his dirk into the open air.  Astoundingly,
the blade managed to prick Tzajai; thus, the Jester declared the dirk the
winner of the contest, imbuing it with magical flight forever.

a pair of glittering golden wingblades~
A pair of glittering hinged wingblades forged from gold lie here.~
These magical wingblades are said to have been created by Tzajai the
Jester.  According to the legend, He created them to impress Ayaunj the
Sterling, whose love for all that glitters is unmatched by mortal or god
alike.  She was, of course, quite taken with the blades and wished to
possess them; Tzajai delighted in briefly commanding Her fascination.  

However, Ayaunj was cleverer than Tzajai anticipated, and challenged Him to
a series of games for possession of the blades.  Never to turn down any
game, Tzajai quickly accepted.  Ayaunj tricked Him into playing ludicrously
unfair games with labyrinthine rules, often thousands of pages in length. 
To win the last, Tzajai had to write His name in seven-hundred and thirteen
different places, as well as initial fourteen more.  

Upon His apparent victory, He taunted Ayaunj, who then revealed that the
final game was a spectacularly elaborate contract for possession of the
blades, as well as nine-hundred and seventy other treasures created by
Tzajai.  She claimed them all, and then sold most of them for a handy
profit.

Forged from gold, these wingblades are a segmented series of metal pieces
designed to fit over the unique curvature of a nefortean wing.  Low, curved
blades of sharpened steel arc along their outer edges.  A series of clasps
and leather harnesses secure them across the wings and about the torso,
aligned in such a way that the wearer would need to shrug into the
assemblage, one wing at a time.

The Western Shore~
The western shore of the lake is rocky and barren.  Rough stones and
pebbles make up the beach, and back from the water\@s edge, boulders and
splintered-off shards of obsidian indicate that the lake is nested in an
ancient volcanic crater.  Between two large rocks, a gaping hole descends
into the ground.

Amidst the rocks, a dark cave-like hole descends at a steep angle.  A
faint draft of air comes from the hole, carrying upon it a musty, salty

A Damp Tunnel~
The hole widens out into a jagged tunnel.  There are handholds aplenty in
the rough walls, but they are slippery and covered with moisture.  Patches
of ochre-colored lichen spot the walls.  Above the light from the tunnel
opening faintly glimmers.  Below, there is only darkness.

A Wet, Jagged Tunnel~
The tunnel here is very rough and jagged, with large slabs of stone
nearly blocking the path in some spots.  The rocks have broken edges and
scrapes, indicating that something or someone has been using the tunnel. 
The tunnel extends west from here, though a dark hole in the ceiling allows
upward travel.  There are small puddles of water pooled among the stones.

The Western Rim of the Sea~
The dark, sprawling sea is still.  The only ripples and waves that mar
the surface are those caused by your movement.  Directly to the south and
west, steep stone walls rise and curve overhead.  Below the surface of the
sea, faint shapes stir and move.  Echoes from the cavern\@s inhabitants sound
faintly in the distance.

Near the Middle of the Sea~
The enormous sea cavern stretches out in all directions.  Around you, the

High above the sea, the grey stone walls are riddled with caves, and rise
higher and higher until they become lost in the distance.

The Cabin of a Strange Vessel~
The cabin walls are fairly intact, having been spared from the fire that
burned portions of the deck.  There is low window that rings the cabin, and
still holds a few shards of scum-covered glass.  Towards the front of the
cabin, a short wooden pedestal stands.  

The sinuous, winding form of the Spiral of Bahhaoth is inscribed here.

spiral~
This inscription is made from dozens of glyphs, each in sequence after
another, gradually tracing out the winding pattern of a spiral.  The
blasphemous runes twist and wind, each one a sinuous structure in its own
right, yet also blending into the next.  

This particular instance of the symbol pulses with a certain power all its
own.  Perhaps if you were to study it, you could learn more.

symbolvision~
Images flicker at the edge of your vision as you study the spiral.  

Each glyph takes you to a different image, until they all blur together in
one unending experience.  

A ship sails on a dead sea, and a red eye looks down on it from above.  

A man takes the face of a woman who takes the face of a man who plunges a
dagger into another man\@s heart.  

Horrible, burbling things arise from the shores of a black ocean, basking in
a place that will never know light.  

Mortal flesh and black ooze are intermingled in the form of a cruel queen,
who laughs as she lashed out with oozing tendrils.  

Black fluid wraps itself around you.  Your throat is closed, and your lungs
ache with the burning of its page.  Your heart seizes...  

The visions are gone, and the image of the spiral is burned in your mind.

A Narrow Grotto Passage~
Along this length of the grotto, the tunnel narrows, so that further
travel to the west is impossible.  The pale granite walls here have a faint
brown-grey cast, and the irregular, rough bumps and nodules on them make the
walls look like an old, poxed human hide.  From the narrow crack to the

Here the grotto walls close inward, making further passage quite

Under a Low Ledge~
The ledge narrows even further here, but rises higher over the water
giving you a better view of the sea to the northeast.  There is an
overhanging stone above you; with that and the ledge, it seems almost like
some giant claw has made a long swipe across this corner of the cavern.  The
ledge curves here, running north and east.  A crack in the ledge, wide
enough to squeeze through, leads to the south.

Directly to the east, an elevated corner of a stony island blocks movement
in that direction.  Around you, the sea waters are still.  Below the water,
faint silhouettes drift and glide.  High above the sea, the grey stone walls
are riddled with caves, and rise higher and higher until they become lost in
the distance.

A Small Stone Hut~
The hut is quite small, and the low ceiling has in its center a
smoke-hole ringed with soot.  Below it, a rusty iron stove rests near a
dirty, crumb-covered table.  The floor is wooden, and the thin boards creak
and groan under your weight.

A Bleak Stone Island~
Rising up out of the middle of the sea is this small stone island.  Rough
and craggy stones elevate about four feet above the waterline, and continue
on to the south and west.  Also to the west, a strange hut built of rock
slabs stands at the corner of the island.

The Eastern Side of the Sea~
The enormous sea cavern stretches in all directions here.  The dark azure
waters are still, and below them, faint silhouettes drift and glide.  High
above the sea, the grey chamber walls are riddled with small caves.  The
walls rise up higher and higher, until they are lost in the distance. 
Directly to the west is a small stone island.

This huge, jagged stalagmite has been worn down over time.  The dark grey
stone is rough, but generally level--it looks like a fang that has been
filed down.  It now serves as a porch for the cave that leads into the west
wall.

The Roof of a Stone Hut~
You are over the island, on top of the small stone hut that is set high
in the northwest corner of the island.  The roof of the hut consists of thin
slate shingles.  There is a hole near the center of the roof, and a thin
wisp of smoke rises up from it.  The island extends further south and east,
and is quite bare except for a bit of flotsam that has washed up on the
stony beach.

High Above the Sea, Along the Northern Wall~
The air is warmer here than down on the surface, and is as calm as the
waters of the sea.  Around you, the walls of the cavern are dotted with cave
entrances, but the majority are located along the northern and eastern
walls.  To the south, a crevice cuts into the wall, forming a huge sheltered
ledge.  Directly overhead, the cavern slopes inward, cutting off further
upward movement.

stalactites hang down like daggers and spears from the top of the ceiling. 
The small cave openings aren\@t limited to the chamber walls, but are carved
up into the stalactites themselves.  Far below, the underground sea is lost
in the distance and darkness.

near the tip, opening up into a cave that you can fly into.  Elsewhere at
this level of the sea cavern, many stalactites hang from the ceiling, slowly
dripping water as they have for eon upon eon.  To the south, an even larger
stalactite hangs, blocking movement in that direction.

A Narrow Crevice~
Here in the crevice, the walls close tightly around you.  The crevice
opens up to the north, where a ledge stands out over the sea.  A large
boulder blocks the crevice to the south.  A soft grey dust covers the stone
floor like a carpet.  Claw- and boot-prints are tracked through the dust.

Among the Stalactites~
You are flying along the very top of the cavern, surrounded by
stalactites of varying lengths and thicknesses.  The air up here is
comfortably warm, and is moist enough that most of the stalactites have a
slow, rhythmic drip.  Only darkness is visible beneath you.  To the north

A Turn in a Small Crevice~
The crevice floor here is difficult to transverse, as the boulders make
walking treacherous.  Flying is no help, as the crevice is too small to
elevate very far.  A faint smell of rotting flesh seems to grow stronger to
the west, and boulders can pushed to the side to return to the ledge
northward.

Here the crevice widens into a small chamber.  The chamber is irregular
in shape, with a rough, uneven floor.  There are a few bones strewn about,
and the repugnant smell of rotting flesh fills the air.  The smell of flesh
and the sight of bones are signs that a creature has been living for some
time here.

This is a long curve in a crooked, twisted tunnel.  Though the tunnel
bends back and forth at odd, but precise angles, one way leads generally

burrowed the tunnel.

The Undersea~
The sea floor is much lower here than in the center and southern areas of

fungal growths.  Small stalagmites rise from the stone floor like skeletal
fingers, and schools of pale-colored fish swim among them.  There is a
current flowing gently from the south to the north.  To the west and north,
tunnels open up in the stone wall.

The sea floor is much lower here than in the center and southern areas of
the cavern.  The grey stone of the bottom is spotted with strange plants and
fungal growths.  Small stalagmites rise from the stone floor like skeletal
fingers, and schools of pale-colored fish swim among them.  There is a
current flowing gently from the south to the north.  Directly north, a small
tunnel leads further past the walls of the cavern.

The sea floor is much lower here than in the center and southern areas of

The Weapon-Trader\@s Nook~
This small, mostly-square trader chamber is hewn from the stone high
above the sea cave of Rahh-Nefor.  It is dimly lit by four large brass
lanterns, two flanking the open entryway to the stalactite tunnel northward,
and two set in the rear corners of the room.  Hooks, stands, and pegs cover
the west, south, and east sides of the room, each bearing weapons which
glint dully in the lanterns\@ light.  The mingled smells of smoke, blade-oil,
and resinous wood permeate the air.

The Hall of the Ajim-Chiaj~
This low-ceilinged chamber has been carved from rough grey stone.  Smoky
torches set in brass sconces light the chamber in a flickering red-yellow. 
The dim light reveals tapestries upon the walls and carpets padding the
floor, and the furnishing are so disparate in color and style that they
appear more a display of stolen goods than carefully selected decoration.  A
few diminutive tables and chairs are placed throughout the room.  The hall

This portion of the L-shaped hall opens up into a spacious room with a
vaulted ceiling.  Three chandeliers formed of drake-skulls hang down, the
flickers of magical fire within the skull eye sockets casting a wan reddish
light throughout the chamber.  Lavish carpets and colorful tapestries adorn
the room but are dominated by a huge black canvas hanging crookedly on the
southern wall, upon which is a painting of crescent moon wreathed in flame. 
A few nefortean-sized tables and chairs are scattered about the room.  Broad
passages lead away to the north and west.

The Den of the Granite Drakes~
The tunnel branches here in three directions.  To the south, a large pile
of bones is visible.  To the north and east, the tunnel continues out
towards the underground sea.  Scattered all about on the floor are bits and
pieces of corroded, broken armor and weapons.  What seemed like smooth grey
stones, on closer inspection, appear to be granite-like scales shed or
broken off the drakes.

A Nest of Bones~
You are in a huge pile of bones stacked and bunched up in a rough
nest-like shape.  In the center of the bone nest, brittle light-grey pieces
of eggshell remain from the drake eggs that have recently hatched.  Small
shreds of rotting flesh are scattered about--it seems the drakelets are
messy eaters.

Almost the Talons of a Drake~
You are tightly clutched in the talons of a hunting granite drake.  The
drake is nearly twenty-five feet long, counting the whip-like tail, and is
covered in stone-hard grey scales.  It glides gracefully, occasionally
beating its wings to maintain altitude.  

Or that was the plan, anyway. An idea before its time...

A Dwelling-Hole Above the Sea~
This small cave houses a family of nefortu.  Past the oval-shaped
entrance leading to the sea-cavern, the cave widens out and continues back
into the stone.  Carved into the walls, shelves and cabinets hold the
various personal items of the family.  The only furniture, a frayed black

Small ledges along the walls are dotted with candles of varying colors and

the room.  Upon it sits a red sandstone altar.  The scent of incense is
heavy in the air, but it fails to completely cover the acrid odors which
waft from the room to the south.

reaching up to clutch it.  The flame burns no visible fuel--it simple twists
and turns into an unnaturally thin and tall tongue of fire, flickering
through its ceaseless and deadly dance.  It may be possible, though perhaps
not very wise, to {Wtouch{x the flame.

The End of a Lava Tube~
Though this lava vent seems to be ancient, its walls are smooth, uncaked
with the dust normally associated with crumbling igneous rock.  Any bits of
stone that might break apart are swiftly swept away by a powerful wind
rushing through the tube from the north, slowing only as it finds egress in
the larger southern passage.  To the north, the lava tube continues into a
darkness filled with the sound of swiftly-moving air.

Though this tunnel is all but featureless, it nonetheless manages to give
off an impression of being very, very old.

The passage grows too narrow to proceed to the west, from which rushes
the powerful wind which fills this lava tube.  A small alcove has been cut
out of the tube, granting a minor measure of relief against the roaring air
currents.  In the alcove and well above a human\@s eye level, a strange runic
pattern has been etched into the wall.  This place is otherwise featureless,
worn smooth and weathered by the constant wind.
