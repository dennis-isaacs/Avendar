Inenilon Loebern heads the Druids of Nendor, high priest of their order. 
Surprisingly young for one so far advanced in the druidical arts, he barely
seems old enough to head such an ancient order.  Most reknowned for his
defeat of the fire devil, Ada\@Chemta\@Boghor.  Saving the woods from the
ravages of that beast of the crimson sands, he won the respect of the entire
order with a single fight.  Now, he tends the altar to nature that is the
center of the religion of the Nendorian druids, teaching the acolytes of the
order the way of Oneness.

The Scrying Pool of Nendor~
This quiet clearing in the forest is completely surrounded by immense
oaks.  Not a single briar or bramble grows here, and the sounds of the
animals which normally fill the wood seem strangely distant.  The
centerpiece of the clearing is a massive stone bowl, filled with
mirror-perfect water.  It is here the gods to gaze into the Scrying Pool of
Nendor to learn much of the mortal world, and watch the mortals that tread
these woods.

A Trail into the Forest~
This trail snakes its way southward through scrubland, gradually heading
into the fabled Woods of Nendor.  The path is lined by a series of smooth
grey stones, clearly demarcating the border between the path and the wilder
regions beyond the trail.  A good ways to the north, you can make out the
walls of Var Bandor, while to the south you can enter the forest proper.

carved with a strange runic character.  To either side of the path, the
woods become overwhelming in short order - tall leafy trees and thick
brambles lie on either side of the trail.  To the north, the forest seems to
lighten somewhat, while to the south the trail continues.  A small side path
leads into the woods to the west.

A Break in the Trees~
These rolling hills pass through the southeastern regions of the Woods of
Nendor.  Less vegetation grows on these stony hills, but here and there a
shrub or two dots the surface of a hill.  Hills stretch all around you, some
steep, some low, stony paths connecting them all together in a complicated
pattern of ups and downs.  To the west, a winding path runs through the
woods.

Bottom of a hill~
You stand at the bottom of a large hill, its surface a mixture of hard
rock and clay.  Little grows here near the bottom of the hill, the hard rock
foundation providing little basis for the roots to take hold.  To the north
and east, the slopes become to steep to allow for travel, while a small path
leads up the hill to the west.  Southwards, a trail leads toward a small
pool, where you can make out the sounds of a waterfall.

shrubs, holdovers from the Woods of Nendor which lie to the northwest.  This
vegetation makes distinguishing one from another a difficult task, so the
hills seem to stretch out for quite a ways.  The stones on the ground seem
mainly hard bedrock, indicating these hills are built on solid rock.

The trail in this part of the woods is more a break in the trees than
anything else.  While the trail is clear and seems well tended, the
underbrush picks up gradually rather than cutting off sharply at the borders
of the trail.  Off to either side of the path are a wide diversity of trees
and foliage, given the forest a very expansive feel.

resumes to the north.

North of the Circle of Stones~
The large stone monoliths to the south form part of a large ring, in the
center of which is the druidical altar to nature.  The stone obelisks are
arranged in a gatelike fashion, where for every two standing vertically, a
third rests horizontal on their top.  The entrance to the guild lies to the
north, or you can enter the inner circle to the south.  To the east and west
a path circles the stone circle, and you can make out altars of some kind.

A Bandit Lair~
The rough walls of this cave are what one would expect from a natural
formation, but the torches and sounds that fill this chamber speak to its
sapient occupancy.  The ceiling is quite high, and the room is illuminated
by the torches which are affixed to large stalagmites.  The room is brighter
to the south, while a rocky formation nearly blocks off passage to the east.

Sleeping Chamber~
This cramped cavern is rather dim, with only some phosphorescent fungus
growing on the large stalagtites providing any illumination.  Signs of
habitations are also visible here and there, where stacks of fir needles are
strewn on the floor, some bunched into piles large enough to provide
cushioning from the hard stone floor.  Most of the room is enclosed by rocky
stalagmites, and the only exit is through a cramped opening to the west.

A Larder~
This rocky cavern is lit by long wooden torches, which frame a wooden
cabinet hung by pegs on the wall.  Several tables and chairs fill the floor
of the room, and the stains and smells of this room indicates that is used
as some sort of larder for food.  Little attention is paid to cleanliness,
and most of the accomodations appear quite old, though well-carved.  Exits
lead to both the north and east.

A Bandit Lair~
The centerpiece of this chamber is a carved wooden throne, which sits
with its back to the east wall.  Silk tapestries hang on the wall, somewhat
torn and soiled, but still obviously works of high quality.  Various furs
drape the throne, placed in an a crude imitation of the trappingsusually
associated with a more royal setting.  The only exit of this chamber is to
the west, where a narrow passage moves between two stalagmites.

shrubs, holdovers from the Woods of Nendor which lie to the northwest.  This
vegetation makes distinguishing one from another a difficult task, so the
hills seem to stretch out for quite a ways.  The stones on the ground seem
mainly hard bedrock, indicating these hills are built on solid rock.

A Heavily Wooded Forest~
This part of the forest is extremely dense, the enormous girth of
old-growth trees blocking travel as the trees grow in close patches.  Thick
brambles also grow in abundance on the ground, making for travelling
conditions that only an experienced woodsman would not balk at.

A Trail in the Woods~
The trail in this part of the woods is more a break in the trees than
anything else.  While the trail is clear and seems well tended, the
underbrush picks up gradually rather than cutting off sharply at the borders
of the trail.  Off to either side of the path are a wide diversity of trees
and foliage, given the forest a very expansive feel.

A Light Path~
Small oaks and beeches line this well-travelled trail.  This part of the
forest is lacking in undergrowth, either from outright culling on the part
of travellers, or just from a fairly large body of pedestrian travel.  The
wind rustles the leaves in the trees here, and the sounds and signs of game
are abundantly present.

The Thin Trail~
This winding path leads away from the main trail, heading deeper into the
forest.  The pattern of crushed underbrush along this trail indicates it
sees more traffic from animals and the like rather than being formally
tended.  The trees also tend to cluster thickly here, letting in only the
occasional sunbeam, resulting in a trail more shadowy than the main path. 
The taller trees show some evidence of being stripped of their bark, and the
lower branches have been picked clean of leaves.  The main path picks up
again to the west, while this smaller trail heads into the brush to the
east.

This winding path makes its way through the woods of Nendor, heading deep
into the forest.  The pattern of crushed underbrush along this trail
indicates it sees more traffic from animals and the like rather than being
formally tended.  The trees also tend to cluster thickly here, letting in
only the occasional sunbeam, resulting in a shadowy trail.  The taller trees
here show some evidence of being stripped of their bark, and the lower
branches have been picked clean of leaves.

The Owlbear Nest~
This part of the trail is mainly blocked by an enclosure of downed trees,
arranged in a pile to protect its contents.  The surrounding foliage seems
to have been used in its construction, leaving few enough trees in the
vicinity for this to be termed a clearing.  The trail leads away from the
enclosure to the both the south and west, heading off into the underbrush.

A Light Forest~
Young trees grow here and there, widely separated and lacking the massive
girths of more ancient trees.  The undergrowth here is sporadic, small
bushes and vines rather than the thicker brambles which grow elsewhere. 
This combination of factors makes for easier travel, and the places where
the undergrowth has been trampled indicate heavy travel of both animal and
otherwise through this region.  A small path leads to the west, and the
ranger\@s guild is to the south.

A Rough Earthen Cave~
A musty animal odor fills this cave, permeating the surrounding air.  The
walls are rough in most places, though some of the stalagmites in this room
show signs of clawmarks of some sort or the other.  Precious little light
trickles into the room from the cave\@s sole exit, which lies through a
narrow opening to the west.

The Stream~
This tributary of the Dantaron river flows gently along through the Woods
of Nendor.  The banks are covered with thick trees, but the branches seem to
hang back from the center of the stream, ensuring that it is well lit.  The
water is cool and unusually clear, even for the Dantaron.  Below the water,
stony rocks litter the stream bottom, most worn smooth by the passing of the
river.

The Pool~
A cool natural spring is the source for both this pool and the small
stream which flows off to the west.  Scooped from the soft ground, the
bottom of this spring is filled with smooth rocks, which help to maintain
the integrity of the spring basin.  The water grows more shallow to the
west, where a small trail leads out of the pool.

A Heavily Wooded Forest~
This part of the forest is extremely dense, the enormous girth of
old-growth trees blocking travel as the trees grow in close patches.  Thick
brambles also grow in abundance on the ground, making for travelling
conditions that only an experienced woodsman would not balk at.

The Decaying Forest~
This portion of the woods seems empty of the wildlife that makes its
presence known in other areas.  The trees here all seem to be either dead or
dying, and they all seem covered in a pale, clinging fungus.  Overhead, what
few leaves there are rustle in the cold wind that rushes through this part
of the forest.  Piles of organic debris litter the ground, evidence of a
decay still in progress.  A stench also seems to permeate these woods, above
and beyond what one would expect from decaying trees.  The landscape of
decaying trees also makes for difficult navigation, as the bleak set of
these trees seems to stretch all around you.

A Game Trail~
This old animal run is now used as a trail through the forest.  The
undergrowth is especially thick along the path, and here and there the
entrance to animal burrows peak out from under the cover.  Trail trees are
home to a wide variety of bird nests, accounting for the cacophony of bird
songs in this area.

A Forest Trail~
This section of the forest is much like any other - tall trees split by a
twisting path through the undergrowth, the trees branches forming a canopy
overhead.  The forest life proliferates in abundance here, and the overall
impression of the trails here is that they are little travelled by anything
other than animal life.  Trails lead off to the north and west, but to the
east, the trees stop as a grass clearing opens.

Grassy Area~
This area of the forest is completely devoid of trees or extensive
undergrowth.  The ground is covered with a brownish grass, which grows on a
layer of thick sod.  Trees grow in a circle around this grassy clearing,
while the trail heads off to the west.

Circle of Mushrooms~
The first thing that strikes you about this room is the preponderance of
mushrooms, of every shape, size, and colour.  More striking is the
arrangement of mushrooms, which grow in a circular pattern around a patch of
clear ground in the center of this clearing.  Every so often, a faint haze
rises up from the ground, spores released from the plentiful fungi here. 
The lack of a breeze gives this place an almost stagnant feel, as the air is
filled with the exhalations of the mushrooms.

Trapper\@s Camp~
This plot of ground near the banks of the river shows many signs of
recent use.  Stretched over rocks on the ground are various animal hides,
some halfway in the process of being cleaned.  On large stakes, leather
sacks hang, most containing a mixture of cleaned hides and salts.  To the
south and west are campfires, while forest looms to the north and east.

This portion of the woods seems empty of the wildlife that makes its
presence known in other areas.  The trees here all seem to be either dead or
dying, and they all seem covered in a pale, clinging fungus.  Overhead, what
few leaves there are rustle in the cold wind that rushes through this part
of the forest.  Piles of organic debris litter the ground, evidence of a
decay still in progress.  A stench also seems to permeate these woods, above
and beyond what one would expect from decaying trees.  The landscape of
decaying trees also makes for difficult navigation, as the bleak set of
these trees seems to stretch all around you.

A Campfire~
Cooking implements are arranged in piles around this campfire, most
showing signs of recent use.  A large spit is arranged over the pit of the
fire, which is filled with hot coals.  Most of the trees in this area have
been chopped down, as evidenced by the bundle of wood near the fire and the
crude fenced enclosure to the west.  The forest resumes to the east and
south, but north lies more of the camp.

Small oaks and beeches line this well-travelled trail.  This part of the

of travellers, or just from a fairly large body of pedestrian travel.  The
wind rustles the leaves in the trees here, and the sounds and signs of game
are abundantly present.

A Charnel Place~
A fetid stench fills the air of this dark place, an olfactory portrait of
the true nature of the heart of the decaying forest.  A blackened moss
covers the trees of this chamber, which ring a small mound in the center of
the room.  What few leaves dot these trees are covered with red splotches,
providing a stark contrast to the normal greenery of the forest.  Most
shocking of all, though, are the skulls which lie stacked about the dirt
mound in the center of this place.  Here and there a full skeleton is
present, but most seem covered by the creeping black moss.  A chill wind
rushes between the trees, filling the air with a soft wail from the hollow
skulls which litter the ground.

A Well-tended Trail~
This section of paths through the forest is quite definitely maintained
by some force other than animal.  Carefully carved from the surrounding
woodland, the trails criss-cross this area of the forest, making efficient
use of natural terrain and plant life.  Game seems plentiful off the edge of
the path, but on the trail proper most of the wildlife one might expect
seems to have shied away from this section of the forest.  To the north, the
trees seem browner, and a fetid wind creeps between the trunks of the trees.

The trail into the guild has been cleared of brambles or other entangling
undergrowth, and the trees grow on either side of the main path.  To the

This glade is devoted to testing the mettle of young rangers through the
use of physical trials.  Chopping blocks are set up to test endurance,
practice dummies rest against trees to test facility with the sword, and
there are even a series of ropes hanging from tree branches to teach
dexterity.  A path leads the glade to the south, where a wide variety of
trees grow.  Northward, you can leave toward the entrance toward this ranger
dwelling, while trees block all other exits.

A camp has been pitched on this small overlook on the river Dantaron.  A
large fire has been built in the middle of the room, surrounded by a circle
of grey stones.  On the banks of the river, wet clothing has been spread,
showing signs of having been scrubbed recently by the soft sands of the
beach.  To the south is a fenced enclosure, while to the east some stakes
jut up out of the ground.

The Altar of Life sits northwest of the of the circle of monolithic
stones.  Carved from pure quartz, it is decorated with the druidical runes
of life, growth, and regeneration.  It is here the Druids of Nendor come to
celebrate each new birth to their order, and the rites of passage into
adult, on the celebrated days of Rebirth.  A path follows the circle of
stones to the east and south, while a wall of elms blocks passage to the
north and west.

every day at dawn and dusk.  Trails follow the circle to the west and south,
while a wall of oaks prevents passage to the north and east.

West of the Circle of Stones~
The large stone monoliths to the south form part of a large ring, in the
center of which is the druidical altar to nature.  The stone obelisks are
arranged in a gatelike fashion, where for every two standing vertically, a
third rests horizontal on their top.  To the north and south a trail follows
the ring of stones, where you can make out some sort of altars.  The only
other exit lies east into the center of the stone ring.

Center of a Circle of Stones~
You stand near the center of a circle formed by a series of massive stone
obelisks.  It is here that the Druids of Nendor attend to the rites of their
religion, and it is here they have erected an altar to nature.  Growing out
of the ground, the altar is living wood, shaped by the prayers and rituals
of the druids.  The only marking on the altar is the sigil of the Druids of
Nendor, which is not carved but rather appears as a raised relief on the
surface of the altar.  Exits lead out through the stone monoliths in all
directions, leading to the exterior path around the circle.

fertility, freedom, and the hunt, this altar is visited once each night by
the Druids of Nendor.  To the north and east a trail follows the circle of
stones, while a wall of maple trees blocks passage to the south and west.

South of the Circle of Stones~
The large stone monoliths to the south form part of a large ring, in the
center of which is the druidical altar to nature.  The stone obelisks are
arranged in a gatelike fashion, where for every two standing vertically, a
third rests horizontal on their top.  A trail follows the ring of stones to
the east and west, where you can make out some sort of altars.  The only
other exit lies north into the center of the ring.

The Altar of Death~
The altar of death sits southeast of the circle of monolithic stones. 
Carved of black ebony, the altar is marked with the druidical runes of
death, burial, and decomposition.  It is here the druids come when one of
their order passing, or one the celebrated Days of the Dead.  To the north
and west, a trail follows the circle of stones, while the way south and east
is blocked by a wall of pines.

A Secluded Grove~
This small clearing is dominated by a grove made up of an astonishing
variety of trees.  Most every tree that grows here in the Woods of Nendor
has a representative here, the rangers preserving and learning from the
trees.  It is here that young rangers learn more of the ways of woodscraft,
hiding themselves in the branches of these trees, and gathering the forest
remedies they are reknowned for.  A little path leads east out of the grove
to a small fire, while a larger glade lies north.

The Tale-Telling Fire~
A campfire burns here, maintained by young rangers.  It is here that
apprentices of the Rangers of Nendor come to learn the lore and eclectic
bits of magic that elder rangers are known to possess.  Less formal training
and moral oral tradition, the fire is the place for the telling of tales,
giving those who come here a sense of their own history.  The only exit from
this small clearing is west, into a grove of trees.

Secret Chamber~
Chiselled from bare rock, this chamber is a roughly hewn cube.  A dim oil
lantern provides the only illumination for the room, casting eerie shadows
down the stairwell which winds out of the southeastern corner of the room. 
The room seems nearly featureless otherwise, the only anomaly being the west
wall, which appears to open outward.

A Storage Room~
This carved stone chamber is lined with a series of shelves, on which all
manner of junk has accumulated.  Various sacks sit on the floor, some
falling apart at the seams, others showing signs of being recently stashed
here.  Tallied on the wall are a series of hash marks, marking a numerical
acquisition of some sort or the other.  The only light in this room is from
a pitch torch on the east wall, and the only exit to be had is the stairs
which lead upward.

The Emerald Dragon\@s Lair~
This burrowed tunnel seems to be the lair of some large creature.  The
floor is littered with bits and pieces bone, with the more complete pieces
stacked in a pile on the side of the room.  Along with the remains of the
dead, beautiful emerald scales are strewn about the room, the ocassional
bits of flesh attached indicating their source is the molting of the
creature that has made this burrow its lair.

Above the Pit~
In the air above the pit, you can see that the sod floor below you is
actually arranged in such a way as to fold under the proper amount of
weight, dumping the unwitting victim into the pit below.  You can return to
safer ground to the west, or descend back into the pit by heading down.

An Earthen Pit~
This rounded pit appears more burrowed than dug, and shows signs of
recent occupancy.  The floor of the room is covered with a wide variety of
skeletons, ranging from what appears to be a small bear to what is clearly
the skeleton of human origin.  The walls of the pit seem too steep for
climbing, and the only other exit is a tunnel which stretches into darkness
to the east.
