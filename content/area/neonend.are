The emerald dragon is here, swinging its head about in search of prey.

The emerald dragon growls darkly, slitted eyes scanning it\@s lair.  It
stands encased in scales of dull emerald coloring, lusterless and coated
with with a fine layer of dust.  Large, deadly claws made for burrowing, but
just as effective at hewing through flesh, sprout from the dragon\@s legs.  A
pair of vestigal wings sprout from it\@s back, now useless for flight.  A set
snapping jaws adorn the serpent\@s mouth, set under flaring nostrils which
sniff the air loudly, trying to catch the scent of prey.

Black eyes gaze out from a transparent ashen face, solid spots of pitch
amidst the diffuse figure.  A cruel grin twists Kirasect\@s features,
malevolence sparking in his black orbs as he regards you.  A pair of whispy
grey wings flow from his back, keeping him aloft without a flap.  Ethereal
flames burn about his figure, flowing over and through the ghostly
apparition, causing the air about him to waver.  An echoing, sourceless
laugh seems to surround him, a dark cackle seeming to come from everywhere
and nowhere.

A large tree, twisted and black, grows amidst the carnage.

A thick tree strains to escape from the very ground, its bark as black as
night.  The ent drips bloodlike sap from a multitude of cracks in the pitch
bark.  Knots of wood seem to travel about its surface, searching.  Great,
twisted black branches reach out from it, searching for flesh.  From its
base spreads a blanket of dark roots, spreading into the diseased forest. 
The roots churn the ground, dragging the gore about the grove to the ent.

A large mass of gray fungus lies here giving off short jets of spores.

A cloud of spores seems to hang about the stony mass, the growth
expelling more with each passing moment.  The fungus is easily several feet

the bandit leader~
The bandit leader rests upon his throne, clad in ragged finery.
~
This man seems a mockery of regality.  His clothes were once of fine make
and perhaps of high fashion, but that was quite a time ago.  The garish
colors of the mis-matched finery, ranging in origin from Earendam to Gaald,
makes him seem almost comical.  The muscles under the colorful raiments and
the fearsome glare upon his face, however, make him one few would laugh at. 
He holds his decorated cudgel with ease as he lounges upon his makeshift
throne, awaiting reports from his underlings.

Down on all fours, the grizzly bear still rises several feet into the
air.  A coat of brown fur shields her from the elements, the rich brown
turning to the gray as it reaches her paws.  Her paws are impressive, large
as a man\@s head with several sharp claws growing from them.  Yellowed teeth
are visible within her muzzle, designed to crush and rend.  A soft grunting
radiates from her as she moves her massive bulk through the forest.

ravages of that beast of the crimson sands, he won the respect of the entire
order with a single fight.  Now, he tends the altar to nature that is the
center of the religion of the Nendorian druids, teaching the acolytes of the
order the way of Oneness.

A trapper mills about the camp, seeing to his hides.

The rich forest green of this ethron trapper\@s hair has been dulled
somewhat by the dirt and grime of outdoors living.  He seems to know his
trade well, carrying his skinner\@s knife with an easy familiarity.  An
unkempt beard no more than a few days old grows on his chin while green eyes
scan lazily about the camp.

Illia~
Illia, the First Templar of the Ashta Harrud Guild of the Void stands here.
~
The human woman before you regards her surroundings with an air of
detachment.  Hard blue eyes look over her surroundings in a calculating
fashion, although you have the faintest impression she does not include
herself in the equation.  Her flesh is coppery-tinted, yet pale, as to
suggest it rarely catches sight of the sun.  Illia seems solidly built, but
her oval face is distinctly feminine.  Her dark brown hair is done up in a
bun behind her head, a few strands wafting loose.  

A long black cloak flows down her back, its surfaces stitched with the
Vhenerin Web of the Ashta Harrud Guild of the Void.  Over her silken
clothes, plates of black steel protect her body, the metal dull and
unreflective.  Upon her hands she wears a pair of delicate midnight gloves
trimmed in white fur.  Her clothing seems unnaturally clean, not a speck of
dust or hair mars them.

the void shade~
The black silhouette of a humanoid stands here, absorbing the light.
~
A humanoid shape of purest black is here, hovering slightly above the
ground.  It reflects nothing, instead appearing to be a simple void of
existance.  The shade appears to be the midnight reflection of a woman when
viewed from an angle, but even this is difficult to tell, as the very being
disappears into itself.  Only one thing breaks the silhouette of inky
darkness, a pair of shining, mercurial eyes gazing hungrily from the void

An inky silhouette of some small beast shambles here, absorbing the light.

Seemingly formless at first, observation lends the silhouette to that of

utter blackness as the shade twists and writes, seeking life to feed upon. 
An unnatural chill surrounds the lesser void shade, seeping into your flesh.

The wide body of this lizard-like beast is covered in hard, stony scales

basilisk with surprising speed and strength.  From its back a nest of
blackened spines grow, twitching with its every movement.  The most
arresting feature of the basilisk, however, is its head, with its great
fanged maw and gleaming yellow eyes.  Its cavernous mouth is filled with
teeth that glisten with poison.  Its eyes are a vivid yellow, arresting
those who it sets its gaze upon with petrifying magic.

A huge grey avian flaps overhead, keening in fury.

A huge grey avian holds itself aloft with great, deliberate beats of its
massive wings.  Elephantine in size, this ancient dust goose sports a razor
sharp beak on its head, perched on a long, flexible neck.  Its black eyes
glitter in insane fury, doll-like orbs promising only death.  A great scar
mars its dust-grey plumage, raking across its stomach.

This nightmarishly large squid looms here, its rubbery, boneless flesh a

the dead sea megalodon~
A great undead shark of impossible size drags itself with frightening speed.
~
This dragon sized shark, surely a relic of some bygone age of giants,
appears to have been dead for some time.  It\@s denticled flesh is riven by
claw-marks and hangs from the grisly cartilidge at places.  Its advanced
decay appears to slow it not at all.  In places brackish black ooze replaces
torn flesh and missing sinew, granting animation to the ancient horror.  

The black ichor boils out of its empty eye-sockets and fearsome-many toothed
maw; a set of jaws able to swallow a man whole.  It lashes out pseudopods of
its unholy, elastic mass to seize the earth and drag its rotting charge with
terrifying speed.

Chapter One: The Dark Pond- The Void Ripple Theory.  

It has been surmised that the channeling of the void for the purpose of
casting creates ripples within the space of the void.  While many of the
lesser castings, simple maledictions and calls for knowledge, cause
insignificant disturbances, other more powerful incantations create
noticable ripples.  

For the most part, these ripples have little effect upon our craft.  It
raises interesting possibilities, however.  If this proves true, it may
allow for the detection of other spells cast by fellow void scholars.  Some
have said that the true reason for the harmful effects of the spells of
\@gate\@, \@nexus\@ and \@phase door\@ are due to the disturbance caused by the
ripples of the casting.  I suspect this to be untrue, however.  The effects
of remaining within the void upon living matter would most likely be
detrimental.  There have been reports of people cast into the void while
under magical observation.  The subjects were reported to suffer no ill
physical results, but began to gibber madly.  They soon began to repeat some
incomprehensible phrase in desperation before they were apparently unmade. 
The claim that no physical harm was incurred is interesting.  Perhaps
survival within the Void would be possible, if the mental degeneration could
be avoided.  

The chapter continues, putting forth ideas on survival within the void.  
~
E
2~
Chapter Two: Demonic Resonance- Could Demonic Summoning be Refined?  

It is theorized that certain ripples resonate with the inhabitants of the
void.  The incantation sends out a ripple that beckons demons to enter this
realm.  The apparent randomness of demonic summoning suggests that these
demons are all clustered approximately the same distance away from the viel.
One wonders what may lie beyond the simple demons we now call.  Perhaps if
were able to somehow delay the effects of the ripples, or make them
undetectable to certain beings within the Void, we could find greater powers
to bind and call forces with more accuracy 

The summoning of Greater Demons is perhaps an example of this.  Have we
incidentally hit upon a way to slip the resonating ripples past the weaker
powers of the void?  If we have, how deep do we penetrate?  Are we ignoring
other demons between the lesser and the greater?  Many questions are raised.
With the refining of the summoning process, answers might be found.  

The chapter continues, giving forth proposals to streamline the summoning
process.  
~
E
3~
Chapter Three: Black Swells- The Result of Ripple Interference.  

There have occasionally been reports of abberent results to rituals and
spells involving the void.  While many are the results of inept handling of
compenents or mispronounciation of an incantation, several incidents can not
be so simply explained away.  It is believed that when several powerful
ripples meet, it can cause a turbulance of sorts within the void, to
oft-unpleasant results.  Many cases of mispossesion and missummonings have
been credited to such.  Incidents of void scholars being stuck within the
other body and negation of personality are discussed in length in a treatsie
by one of my contemperaries, Rzkakiz.  

Missummonings are noteably less common, but usually more dramatic.  Jyraka,
a high wizard of the Yithoul tribe, reportedly attempted to summon a runaway
slave back to the temple.  Despite a reportedly flawless circle, the spell
went awry.  The result was the chaja being summoned into her body, the two
merging into a formless mass.  The resulting dissection showed the bodies
had indeed fused.  At the time, no less than 3 nexuses had been opened
around the cavern.  

The chapter continues, giving many more gruesome examples of failed
summonings.

The Forest Path~
A thin but well worn path winds through the forest of Nendor.  Stones
inscribed with odd runic markings dot the side of the path every now and
again, standing on the border between road and forest.  Large oaks line the
path on either side, leaves casting shade upon the path below.  The singing
of birds echoes through the forest, providing a constant murmur of sound. 
To the west and south the trees seem slightly more crooked, branches and
trunks slightly twisted.  There seems to be a break to the south, into the
twisted growth.

A Trail Through The Hills~
This trail leads through the rolling hills of southeastern Nendor.  The
hills are relatively unvegetated in comparison to the rest of the forest. 
Even so, an occasional beech or shrub springs up on the rocky slopes.  Hills
of varying size spread all around you.  Westward, the forest begins to
encroach upon the hills, the density of shrubs and trees thickening.

of the ground, the altar is living wood, shaped by the prayers and rituals
of the druids.  The only marking on the altar is the sigil of the Druids of
Nendor, which is not carved but rather appears as a raised relief on the
surface of the altar.  Exits lead out through the stone monoliths in all

A Cleared Path~
This path through the Nendor woods has been kept meticulously clean.  No
twigs or growth mar the fine dirt path running though the forest.  The sides
of the path are lined with dense shrubbery.  A break in the shrubs allows
passage to the south, while the neat path continues westward.  The trail

Entrance to the Ranger Guild~
A carving on a tree reveals this to be the location of the band of the
fabled Rangers of Nendor, one of the oldiest bodies of its kind in Avendar. 
The trail into the guild has been cleared of brambles or other entangling
undergrowth, and the trees grow on either side of the main path.  To the
south, the trail leads into the guild proper, while the main path lies
north.

A Ranger Grove~
This glade is devoted to testing the mettle of young rangers through the
use of physical trials.  Chopping blocks are set up to test endurance,
practice dummies rest against trees to test facility with the sword, and
there are even a series of ropes hanging from tree branches to teach
dexterity.  A path leads the glade to the south, where a wide variety of
trees grow.  Northward, you can leave toward the entrance toward this ranger
dwelling, while trees block all other exits.

A Secluded Grove~
This small clearing is dominated by a grove made up of an astonishing
variety of trees.  Most every tree that grows here in the Woods of Nendor
has a representative here, the rangers preserving and learning from the
trees.  It is here that young rangers learn more of the ways of woodscraft,
hiding themselves in the branches of these trees, and gathering the forest
remedies they are reknowned for.  A little path leads east out of the grove
to a small fire, while a larger glade lies north.

A Shaded Forest Path~
A wide path cuts a swath through the thick undergrowth here.  Tall trees
of all sorts grow thickly here, their heavy branches interlocking overhead
to block out the sun almost entirely.  Streams of sunlight shine through the
thick foliage here and there.  The path is marked by wagon ruts and
footprints leading east and west.

A Dark Forest~
The forest continues all about, almost seeming to entwine itself behind
you.  The forest is dark now.  Very little light penetrates through the
canopy of leaves.  The branches about you seem to reach out for something,
their forms twisted as if in agony.  The ground beneath you looks damp and
mossy, becoming moreso to the south.  The stench of decay is heavy in the
air, the smell almost overpowering.

A Path Through the Thick Woods~
A wide path cuts a swath through the thick undergrowth.  Tall trees of
all sorts of varieties spring up along the path.  The sky is visible,
foliage doing little to obscure it.  Footprints and wagon ruts mar the dirt
path, showing it has been recently traveled.  The density of the elms and
oaks along the path make stepping off it most difficult.  The woods become
darker to the east, the thick and lush trees blocking the sunlight.  A small
game trail crosses the road to the north and south.

The forest becomes less dense, small oaks and beeches lining the trail. 
This part of the forest is lacking in undergrowth, either from outright

A Thickly Wooded Forest~
Thick undergrowth packed between dense trees makes movement through this
part of the forest difficult, and in some places impossible.  Bits of light
finding their way through the verdant foliage provide adequate illumination
and allow the growth of the brambles and weeds that spread around the trees.
You notice a the low branches of a nearby oak, offering firm purchase for
climbing.  To the south, the forest grows dark and twisted, and the stench
of decay and rot can be clearly detected.  No animal tracks whatsoever lead
to this area, as if all life shuns the decay.

A cool natural spring is the source for both this pool and the small

The Tale-Telling Fire~
A campfire burns here, maintained by young rangers.  It is here that
apprentices of the Rangers of Nendor come to learn the lore and eclectic
bits of magic that elder rangers are known to possess.  Less formal training
and moral oral tradition, the fire is the place for the telling of tales,
giving those who come here a sense of their own history.  The only exit from
this small clearing is west, into a grove of trees.

From your vantage point above the pit it is apparent the sod was little

Twisted trees spring up all around, branches warped in the throes of

The forest continues all about, almost seeming to entwine itself behind
you.  The forest is dark now.  Very little light penetrates through the
canopy of leaves.  The branches about you seem to reach out for something,
their forms twisted as if in agony.  The ground beneath you looks damp and
mossy.  The stench of decay is heavy in the air, the smell almost

Rveyelhi Helpfile Room~
Rveyelhi, a once-mortal shuddeni Guardian, is a servitor diety of Iandir.
He currently oversees the house of Guardian in Iandir\@s stead while the
greater diety tends to other planes and worlds.  

A brutally efficient guardsman in mortality, Rveyelhi endorses a similarly
strict manner of dealing with criminals.  Followers of Rveyelhi believe that
those who would break the law are little more than rabid animals clawing at
the tapestry of civilization.  These beasts are to be put down, lest their
scratching unweave it.  Law breakers, as well as anyone else who would bring
chaos to the world, are to be dealt with by any means within the bounds of
law and with no mercy.  

Followers of Rveyelhi found worthy are branded with the Sigil of the Black
Staff.

A Dirt Path Through the Forest~
This dirt path seems to be rarely traveled, used more by animals than
anyone else.  The trail cuts through the dense woods of the Nendorin hills. 
The path has managed to avoid becoming overgrown, making travel easy enough,
and enjoys the shade of the tall forest trees.  The trees become
increasingly sparse as the Nendor Forest approaches it\@s border to the north
while to the west, the path loses itself in the dense foliage.

partially obscuring the sky.  As the path winds south, the forest grows

road branches off to the west, marked by many footfalls and wagon wheels.

This heavily-wooded dell is almost a cleft in the ground, the earthy
walls rising sharply all around the bowl-shaped depression.  Predominantly
walled in with ferns and creeping briars, the dell is filled with the earthy
smells of uninhibited growth.  Tall oaks arch together overhead.  A slab of
green-speckled malachite juts from the most level space in the center of the
clearing, seeming to spring from the very foundations of the earth.  The
flora all about seem to strain and reach, each leaf, branch, and stalk bent
towards the altar-like stone.  A small, moss-covered path climbs its way out
of the dell, rising to the north.
