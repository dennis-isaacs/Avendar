This passage through the sewer is cold and dank, with a floor of thick,
black mud.  The walls here are sturdy granite, the ancient stones mortared
together time and again over the centuries.  Numerous small pipes and drains
are poised to empty raw sewage from above, but they have all been sealed
over recently.  To the north, the sewer continues, and the air is rancid and
foul. Here, though, there is surprisingly little stench.  Instead, a faint,
almost alchemical odor is present, growing stronger to the south.

esay \@lists, brushing his fingertips along the wall as he walks\@ As the tongue of the flame, the path of the Raging Inferno sears and consumes all it touches, most of all the wielder. It is destruction and evanescence.

A templar swordsman slouches against the doorway.

This templar swordsman slouches against the square doorway which leads
northward, idly staring at those who pass.  His armor is in a general state
of disrepair, but it is still clearly the livery of the Company of the
Jackal, one of Earendam\@s chartered fighting companies of less than noble
reputation.

Lord Davgar~
Lord Davgar frowns as he examines a scroll at his desk.
~
Lord Davgar is the youngest son of one of Earendam\@s more modern noble
families.  Taking what little inheritance bequeathed to him, he gambled a
small stake into enough gold to form his own chartered company-in-arms. 
Known for their ferocity and double-dealings, the company has quickly grown,
by offering its services to nobleman and merchants as far north as the
Brintors.  Davgar himself is still a young man, although his face betrays a
life given over to dissolution and taking the quick and easy path along the
magics of Fire.

Calirin aklaju conclave eguild eguildmaster guildmaster~
Calirin~
Calirin sits at his desk, lost in thought as he pens a scroll.
~
Calirin is clad in the black robes of his order, his hood framing a face
unusually free of the lines of those in their middle years.  A man in the
odd position of being at the confluence of two of Earendam\@s social classes,
he holds himself with an air of aloofness befitting his position.  As the
high priest of the Aklaju, he occupies a lofty, if socially distasteful role
as head of the clergy of the dark temple.  In his dual capacity, he is also
a formidable scholar, using his position as keeper of the temple to delve
into the magics of void once forbidden under the Republic.  Known for his
abilities at manipulation, Calirin has managed to amass a power base for
himself rivaling that of many a nobleman, while maintaining a relative
social anonymity.

Elerand~
Elerand putters about the library, absent-mindedly tending its books.
~
Famed in his younger days for his creation of the Avlistan Wall, Elerand
has now retired from the role of active archmage to tend the Glallian
School\@s library.  A tall and gangly fellow, his thin face is stretched like
parchment across his bird-like features.  Now a bit absent minded, he can
occasionally be heard muttering about forgotten enchantments to himself.

Anteles is a portly man, well beyond his middle years, but still known
for his magic.  Almost as famous for his bald pate as he is for his
appetites, his sharp blue eyes belie a man who has sucuumbed neither to age
nor indulgence.  Heading the administration of the school, he serves as the
liason between the artists and scholars here and their noble patrons. 
Possessing a shrewd legal mind, the school\@s interests have prospered in no

nobility.

A provocative beauty even in her middle years, Lania is one of Earendam\@s
most famed artists, along with being a formidable archmage of earth.  Her
raven hair is only slighty broken by a hint of silver, and her face shows
the inevitable signs of matronliness, but her body is still that of a young
woman.  Known in her youth to enjoy the Patrician\@s personal patronage, she
parlayed herself into a position as headmistress of the Glallian School,
despite powerful opposition from the male-dominated patron system in
Earendam.

Lilisa stands here, small and forlorn, staring vacantly at the world.

Curly red hair swirls around the face of this willowy, spectral figure. 
Lilisa\@s features, once youthful, have now assumed a timeless, stagnant
quality.  Her face has no wrinkles or other overt signs of age, but lines of
grief and anguish are cut deeply into her smooth face.  Her flesh is a bony
white, offset only by lips the color of blood.  Pale blue veins line her
hands and arms, adding to the marble-like quality of her skin.  Most
haunting, though, are her eyes -- grief-stricken and sunken into the hollow
of her skull.  Unmoving, they stare sadly as she gazes out into the world.

Tessolos shade~
the shade of Tessolos~
An eerie caladaran shade floats here.
~
The shade of Tessolos floats listlessly, his pale form a mere inches
above the ground.  Despite the absolute absence of color, an intricate
pattern of pale lights and darks trace out his features.  

A mane of wild ghostly hair frames his sepulchral features, wildly askew
like the mane of a lion or a poet\@s.  His large, blunt nose is framed above
by thick, long eyebrows, and below with a drooping moustache.  

Most striking, though, is his gaze.  Still gripped by the passions of his
life, his eyes are easily the most solid part of this shade, smoky black
orbs which stare relentlessly out at his surroundings.  

Breaking the intensity of his stare are long lines which crisscross his
face, marking his stern demeanor with visible marks of agony and sorrow.  

The shade wears a set of battle armor, over which is draped a garment closer
to a shroud than a tunic.  Inscribed in its tunic is a black triangle, with
an open eye squarely in its center.

say Hierophant of a druidical order which had not sided with the srryn in the war, Saldaris came forth from the woods of Lithling to help heal the damaged lands of Avendar.
say His gifts to the humans living on the Dantaron are memorialized in Saldarin Plaza, which is planted with the trees he so loved.

>data_prog qalnistra~
say Qalnistra lived in the age of Earendam\@s rise to power.
say A devout priest of Jolinn, the ardor of his faith fueled his quest to build a temple to his god in Earendam.
say For thirty years, he collected the money and manpower to build the temple, rousing the citizens of his day in a religious revival. 
say Qalnistra lived to see the cornerstone of his temple set, and was laid to rest in a bier in the stones of the temple to his beloved god.

>data_prog dantaron~
say Ah yes, the mighty Dantaron. 
say The river has been fished by humans since the dawn of recorded history, providing the fertile grounds for the beginnings of civilization. 
say The origins of the word are lost to history, though I suspect it may have referred to some ancient word for a river spirit.

>data_prog cetilin~
say Elas Cetilin was a famed bard, whose favored instrument was the lute. 
say Designing countless arrangements for the lute for private performance, Cetilin proved equally the master composer and musician. 
say The tone of his pieces were notably melancholy, perhaps stemming for the times in which he lived-- the waning years of Earendam, following the War of Night.

>data_prog crescent~
say Crescent Street\@s nomenclature is much more commonplace, I fear.

>data_prog frinia~
say Frinia Alarand was an archmage of air, who was known for her illusions as well as her superb paintings.
say Living in Earendam\@s gold age, Frinia\@s works were considered masterpieces in her own day, and are now quite priceless.
say Rumoured to weave illusion in the permanent media of canvas and paint, most of her subjects are scenes of beauty and grandeur, with the occasional diversion of an epic battle scene. 
say The patronage of her supporters was instrumental in founding the school of the Silver Griffin.

>data_prog trinian~
say It is thought that \@Trinian Way\@ is a corruption of \@Truna\@s Way\@. 
say Truna is one of the near mythical figures in Earendam\@s history, that people the early days of the city.
say Truna was accounted a great hunter among humans, and made his living trading in furs and game caught in the fertile Lithling Valley.
say He is reputed to have traveled further and longer than most of the humans who lived in their primitive settlement on the river. 
say In time, he met the ethron who lived in the western Lithling valley, and took one of their own women as a wife. 
say Making peace with the ethron, he became exceedingly wealthy due to trade with their people, becoming one of the most famed of Earendam\@s heroes.

>data_prog jralin~
say Some say this street was named after a long-departed noble family, but I find it a far more likely that the street name is actually a corruption of the god Jolinn\@s name.
say There is evidence for this, as the name obeys the rules of the ancient human tongues of those who once hunted this region.
say I am certain that the street has been rebuilt many times in Earendam\@s history, but its location in the new city points to this far more fascinating linguistic explanation for the street\@s name.

>data_prog calvala~
say Calvala was Earendam\@s second Patrician, being appointed after Corvandil\@s death. 
say His reign saw the return of prosperity to Earendam, as he negotiated a series of trade treaties with Var Bandor. 
say While derided by the aesthetes among Earendam\@s nobility as allegedly being of common descent, Calvala was actually the scion of a minor, if very well established house. 
say His appointment proved that no one faction among the nobility would come to dominate the appointment of Patricians-- 
say He was in fact the fourth candidate proposed for the position, and offered as a compromise between competing views.
say His economic successes provided needed funds to continue Earendam\@s support of the Great Library, and he ended his life well-loved.

>data_prog salyra~
say Salyra is an old name in Earendam, you know.
say She was the first human archmage of water, and renowned as a healer.
say Following the War of Fire, she organized the building of what we now know as the tower of Salyra.
say It became a center for the study of the magics of water, being built on an isle in the Dantaron. 
say The old city grew up near the tower, as it was a center both for culture and magic after the War of Fire.
say It has remained in existence since that time, tended by an order of healers.

>data_prog scero~
say Malvus Scero was a prominent merchant, who donated large sums of gold to help build the \@New City\@ following the first Kankoran Wars.
say Rumors of his association with the black arts aside, Scero\@s influence allowed for the official toleration of the magics of void.
say The grounds were that their divinatory powers could help forestall another invasion such as that seen in the kankoran wars.

>data_prog glallia~
say Vaelan Gllalus was one of the greatest earth scholars in human history. 
say Living at the very acme of Earendam\@s glory, he revolutionized both architechture, aesthetics, and the magics of earth.
say Prior to his lifetime, the magics of earth had been used to build walls, homes, and shelters for men, but had not been used to create great art.
say Gllalus used the magic not only to create buildings, but to imbue them with his own personalized aesthetic style. 
say Today, you can see this style everywhere in Earendam, and in the school that bears his name.

>data_prog pasintian~
say Of all the great beauties associated with Earendam, none is more memorable than that of Pasintia, reputed to be the fairest of Earendam\@s daughters.
say Living in the golden age of the Republic, Pasintia was widely sought after by the men of her day. 
say Spurning all human suitors, Pasintia left Earendam for the love of an aelin prince, choosing to live in beautiful Ilodaiya, forsaking her own people and city.
say Her decision to leave Earendam enraged her father, a powerful Senator, who saw fit that she be banished forever from the city.
say Legend records two fates for Pasintia:
say One, where her aelin lover lead an army to defend Earendam from an attack by a rival human kingdom, and they were received as heros.
say The other, where she and her lover are invited back by a forgiving father, only to be poisoned in a final act of treachery.

>data_prog jyndril~
say Jyndril Dragonbane is an almost mythical figure from Earendam\@s golden age. 
say A swordmaster, Jyndril gained fame in securing various settlements in the Brintors from the incursions of hill giants.
say Allegedly visited by the god Jolinn himself, Jyndril traveled south, where the popular story is that he slew an ancient dragon of flame named Akal\@Naris. 
say After slaying the great dragon, he returned to Earendam, where he brought the dragon lore he had learned in time to thwart an uprising in Sythtys, where the shamans of fire had bound a flight of fire drakes to their will.
say Of course, all such stories must be taken with a great of salt (a single man slaying a great dragon?).
say It is true howerver that those of Ashta Harrud venerate a \#Jyndru\#, who they claim saved their city from a great dragon of fire, perhaps lending some credence to this otherwise unbelievable tale.

~
>data_prog lystaran~
say Lystaran was a storied general from the time of the War of Night, who lead the fighting company known as the Company of the Golden Hand. 
say Early successes in the war against a possible srryn incursion lead to his elevation to head of the bulk of Earendam\@s templar contingent.
say He proved a superb tactician, fighting the shuddeni to a draw at a time when other leaders were being routed by the unfamiliar tactics and magic of the shuddeni.
say His innovative combat strategy served the forces of the light well, until, tragically, he fell in one of the final battles of the war.

>data_prog kaagn~
say Kaagn\@s name darkens the history of Earendam.
say Originally, he was a noble scholar of earth, a scion of one of Earendam\@s wealthiest families.
say Widely considered the greatest scholar of his generation, Kaagn\@s researches took him far afield from the commonplace enchantments of earth. 
say With hindsight, we can now realize Kaagn was actually the one behind human expeditions that eventually unearthed the shuddeni, and that he profited immensely in learning the ways of their dark magic.
say It is not known whether Kaagn was his own master, or merely a pawn of Yithoul, but his obvious talent with his magic speaks of a man not easily bent to the will of others. 
say During the war, his connections to the shuddeni remained unknown, and he advocated a policy of utilizing the tools of the shuddeni against their masters, without ever overtly revealing how far he had progressed in the dark arts. 
say In the end, seeing his plans for open studies of the dark arts thwarted by the coming of the ch\@taren, he moved to broker a deal that would deliver Earendam into the hands of the shuddeni, only to be foiled by the cunning of the rogue Tyril.
say Kaagn met his end atop his tower in the old city.
say Revealed in his allegiance to the dark gods, he duelled the spirit templar Telan Nador, and fell to his death on what is now known as Kaagn Row.

>data_prog tyril~
chuckle
say You would be hard pressed to find a more controversial figure in Earendam\@s history than the legendary Tyril.
say Some accounts have him a minor noble of a house disenfranchised by political enemies-- but these same accounts are made by the window dressers of history. 
say Without a doubt, Tyril was a rogue, making his living working for wealthy patrons who had need of his services.
say Certainly though, his temperment was not entirely mercantile in character. 
say It was Tyril who foiled the machines of the archmage Kaagn, who had planned to make truce with the shuddeni, and deliver the city into their hands.
say To add to the turmoil surrounding Tyril\@s eventual fate, there are even conflicting accounts of his final end!
say The traditional story has Tyril stealing Kaagn\@s spellbook and plans, but perishing as he fought to keep them safe.
say I feel compelled to point out that this ending obeys the canons of the heroic epic. 
say While it is certainly true that the gods appreciate fate\@s more pointed ironies, the similar format to the epic in this ending in my mind makes it almost certainly fiction.
say Other endings have Tyril making off with an exorbitant reward from the Senate following the war, and leading a retiring life on an obscure and outlying estate, far removed from his enemies.
say In my mind, this version of events seems the most likely, especially given Tyril\@s character.
say More sinister accounts (generally favored by the anti-Republican elements of our society) have Tyril assassinated by a jealous senate, who feared his phenomenal popularity with the masses.
say Regardless of the actual outcome, the northern square and gate of the city bears his name, where his statue stands, a monument built by the victorious Patrician Corvandil after the first Kankoran War.
say As you can see, his life is a tapestry of legend, half truths, and outright fabrications -- much the way, I reckon, that he lived it.

>data_prog corvandil~
say Ah yes, the first Patrician.
say Corvandil has become something of a legendary figure among Earendam\@s nobility, representing the strong favor which the Patricians\@ rule has experienced.
say In the chaos of the kankoran wars, with an horde of kankorans approaching the walls of the city itself,the Senate (allegedly, mind you), disbanded, cravenly acting to save itself.
say Corvandil Novis, a templar and nobleman, stepped forward to lead the troops into battle. 
say Since his leadership was viewed as having saved the city, and the Senate was in acute disfavor at the time, a new government was ushered in, with Corvandil as Patrician.
say Once he took office, Corvandil took on the name Lyceonis as the new name of his house.
say Nowadays, the Patrician is selected by a council of noblemen, every ten years. Typically, successful Patricians will be re-elected, and remain in power until their deaths.
mpunfocus
~
>data_prog valectis~
say Perhaps the most notorious of the Patricians, Valectis ruled Earendam roughly a hundred years following the appointment of Corvandil.
say Valectis\@ rise to power came with a movement for reform in Earendam\@s legal and social institutions, many of which were holdovers from the days of the Republic.
say By and large, his reforms were needed. Most notable was the changing of the calendar to our current system, measured in years since the end of the Republic. 
say Along with these, he issued a series of edicts, gradually increasing his own power, in the person of the Patrician\@s office.
say While Earendam prospered under his reign, nobles and commoners alike feared his rise to power, and he was eventually the first Patrician to be assasinated.
say Whether or not this was the catalyst for the second Kankoran war is a more complicated matter --
say I suggest you consult a good book on the subject.

>data_prog valvaria~
say Valvaria Street is known for the pleasures it offers to those who have the time and wealth for such things.
say While there is no historical Valvaria, she is typically portrayed as a wanton or licentious woman. 
say Some have hypothesized that she originated as a fertility goddess, worshipped by early humans.
say There is at least some evidence for this, as seen in the choice of symbols for Earendam\@s House of Games; a golden sunburst, which could vary easily represent the life-giving energies of the spring sun.

~
>data_prog earendam~
say As you know, it is a widespread myth that our city was named after a specific man who founded it.
say The story of Earen, the brother of Aramril and Salyra, was popularized by the first Patrician, Corvandil, during a period of patriotic revival in the city. 
say Sadly, the story of Earen is just that-- as most scholars realize, \@Earendam\@, in the old human dialect, means \@place of the river\@.
say This simply describes the place of trading fish and game that was the predecessor of the modern city of Earendam.

note + 
note + - Please tell us where you are looking at having your building placed. If you
note + have a specific room in mind to build from, please suggest that, or simply the
note + area you are looking at building in, and a general vicinity within that area.
note + 
note + - Please also describe what you are looking at building, in general-- what it
note + should look like, what features you are interested in having, such as places
note + to sit, drinking water, etc. If we do require further information, we will
note + contact you directly.
note + 
note + - If you are interested in building a shop of some sort, please tell us what
note + you are looking at selling, how you want the shop keeper to be, and so on.
note + Please keep in mind that shops can be a great deal more expensive than a
note + simple house. However, we do offer assistance in terms of financial backers--
note + you will be expected to roleplay such a thing out, but it is possible to find
note + investors who are willing to front some of the cost of the final total. Keep
note + in mind, however, that these people will be part owners of your business, and
note + are absolutely entitled to their proportional share of the proceeds!

A slender, rather plain looking woman busies herself here.

An unremarkable human woman of roughly thirty years of age, Garelna\@s
nondescript features, bowed head, and timid gaze lend to the impression of a
shy, aging spinster.  Slender and petite, she moves with a quiet determined
demeanor.  Somewhat thick spectacles perch on the end of a thin nose, the

aelin burly woman female luthelle mayeran uncanny looming~
Luthelle~
An uncannily burly aelin woman looms here.
~
Luthelle Mayeran is a notorious priestess of Alil, famed for being thrown
out of half the drinking establishments in the Dantaron river valley.  Her
frame carries some obvious pudge, enough to make an aelin like herself
noticably overweight, though it leaves her merely curvy by human standards. 
Her hair is elaborately styled, rarely seen in the same colour or shape
twice, such that the famed Converumir Brawl was reputedly started over
accusations of wig-wearing.  Rather than robes of office, she wears an
elaborate set of leather armour, of a form-fitting and rather revealing cut.

the shade of Professor Turaythe Oneaci~
The shade of a tall scholar hovers near the desk.
~
The shade of a tall man hovers before you, reaching near to seven feet in
height.  Seemingly put together by some humorous deity with an eye for
extremes, his translucent frame might best be described as stretched.  That
adjective is easily transferred to each appendage and features.  His graying
hair is unkempt, indeed unkeepable, standing straight out, lying flat, or
sticking at something of an angle, each strand seemingly unaffected or
uncaring of the direction or disposition of its neighbors.  His fingers are
unnaturally long, so much so as to require modification to his gloves, with
each of those having the tips of the fingers cut open to allow the digits to
protrude out past the first knuckle.  Arms, legs, and torso sport similar
dimensions, although he appears to have found a tailor willing to craft
garments to fit his frame in those respects.  Atop his finely crafted pants
and shirt, though, he wears armor that is obviously not crafted specifically
for him, leaving gaping holes where it is short in length, and bunching up
where breadth is over-stated.  His elongated countenance gives him a
melancholy look, with an exaggerated point to his chin, long and hooked
nose, and dangling lobes on tall, narrow ears.  Even his eyes appear
stretched downward, rounding out the orbs and making them appear to bulge
oddly in their sockets.  Over his body he wears a long cloak, though like
the rest of his garb, its ethereal nature does little to mask his ungainly
appearance to the very casual observer.

riatha eilol~
Riatha Eilol~
Riatha Eilol studies quietly, keeping half an eye on the cipher-viewer.
~
Possessed of a pale, pinched face and unusually slim physique, the aelin
Riatha Eilol appears little more hale than some of the patients downstairs. 
One of her wings is clearly damaged, with a large section torn away to
expose ragged, scarred-over edges.  The other wing, which occasionally
wavers feebly in the air, is missing some feathers but otherwise seems
intact.  Brought to the tower of Salyra as a young aelin already maimed,
Riatha has never spoken of the source of her injuries.  Instead, she has
devoted herself to scholarship, eventually becoming an able journeywoman of
water with an unusually-deep knowledge of ancient texts.  These days she is
rarely found outside the Chamber of Study, where she tends to the
cipher-viewer passed down the generations by the Archmage Salyra herself.

Etziza~
A one-eyed nefortu hunches over a glass forge, blowing through a long pipe.
~
Burn scars line this grey-brown nefortu\@s hands and arms up to nearly
their elbows, and their left eye is permanently blistered shut.  This alone
identifies them as Etziza Kiisoth, a nigh-legendary glass-blower who fled
far-off Ashta Harrud some years ago for reasons never made public.  The
numerous plugs and fangy spirals pierced right through their lengthy ears
show obvious skill and craftsmanship, even at a distance.  More prominently,
however, is the crystal sphere that hovers over their left shoulder, green
and white, like a strange disembodied eye.  As part of an agreement with the
Glallian school allowing them to do business in the glass trade, Etziza has
agreed to take on certain students of the School\@s who have particular
interest in metalwork and forge-crafts.

Yiskurra wears the deep reds of the Arkhilra, those who have pledged

both magic and the sword lead to his meteoric rise to power in the hierarchy

Elisheba woman dark skinned~
Elisheba~
A dark skinned woman stands quietly by the hearth.
~
A woman with black hair and dusky skin stands motionless by the
fireplace, her eyes scanning a small book, which she holds in one slender
hand.  Somewhat small in stature and smooth of skin, the woman gives an
immediate impression of youth, although furrows of concentration on her brow
and the confidence in her poise suggest years beyond her appearance. 
Dressed in a short, black evening dress, she looks to be in the height of
fashion for Earendam, but for her lack of footwear and the long, scabbarded
sword she wears by her side.

Laeru Atheniel~
A thin aelin man sits behind a large desk, watching you expectantly.
~
Laeru Atheniel sits attentively behind his polished, rosewood desk.  The
most notable thing about the aelin is the perfection of his grooming - from
his short, immaculately arrayed black hair to his cleanly pressed, spotless
black suit.  Even his tasteful burgundy cravat is aligned with precise
symmetry.  Groomed wings of charcoal-grey are folded primly behind him, and
his slender, pale hands are clasped upon the desk in front.  The man\@s brown
eyes follow your movements expectantly.

an aelin cellist~
An auburn-winged aelin cellist fills the hall with a resonant rhythm.
~
A sober, somewhat severe expression rests upon the face of this aelin
man, as he draws his bow back and forth across the cello strings, his nimble
fingers expertly working the fingerboard.  His black-suited body is quite
still, but his wings - a deep auburn in colour - stretch out behind him, and
move in the deep rhythm of the cello.

A small nefortu draws sonorous notes from her clarinet.
~
This small nefortu woman manages to achieve surpisingly deep, resonant
notes on her clarinet, which is almost as long as she is tall.  She is
dressed in a neat, black suit, a similar shade to her skin, and sits perched
on a high stool, her wings hanging down toward the ground.

An efficient, neatly-groomed waiter moves about the hall.
~
A well-trained waiter moves fluidly and inconspicuously about the tables,
tending to the requests of all patrons.  Occasionally he ducks into the
kitchens to pick up a set of dishes, which he dextrously balances on his
arms as he walks.

a Harrudim bodyguard~
A muscular guard, dressed in exotic, colourful clothing, guards the door.
~
A tall bodyguard stands by the hallway door, guarding it with undivided
attention.  The man is heavily muscled, and deeply tanned.  His head is
closely shaven, and his heavy-set features bear a faint sneer.  He wears a
colourfully embroidered waistcoat, open at the front, and loose, silk
pantaloons of fiery ochre.  In one massive hand he grips a large, ornate
falchion, and in the other a coiled whip.

This slightly-built aelin stands with a look of polite attention on his

immaculate grooming - from his short, carefully arrayed black hair to his
cleanly pressed, spotless black suit.  Even his tasteful burgundy cravat is

Neatly-trimmed long, dark hair and a small, elegant moustache are
well-oiled, complimenting his tanned skin.  The man\@s face is almost savage
in its lines, a lumpish nose and a low brow giving him a brutal appearance. 
Ham-like hands appear capable of considerable violence, the nails trimmed
neatly.  The man stands with an obedient pose, hands clasped and head
slightly bowed.

Eniada Chajai is a stately caladaran woman with skin like pale
birch-bark.  Her expression is solemn but serene, her hands and wrists
bearing the distinctive proof of a life lived studying the possibilities of
alchemy.  Her hair is uncharacteristically dark for her race, eschewing the
usual greens or browns for an almost raven-black.  Rigid and serious, she
has flourished by applying her formidable insight to Earendamian politics. 
Attractive by the odd aesthetic of the caladaran, her striking exoticism has
made her a stand-out amongst both her peers and rivals.  She now oversees
the Circle of the Erudite Eye, ensuring that its connections remain intact.

a young student~
A young student of alchemy studies quietly here.
~
This young human is quite pretty; her long golden hair flows in wavy
tresses down her back, bits of it partially obscuring her face as she
studies an alchemical tome.  Her eyes are a bright and sparkling blue, and
her forehead is scrunched in thought.  Her fair-skinned arms are thin but
not frail, their natural grace representative of the rest of her body.

This older guardsman relaxes in his home.  The home itself, originally

the Earendam guard.  The married pair, being aelin and human, had no heirs

Cidone Rotheld~
A tall, sturdy man with steel-grey hair paces about the room.
~
The head of the house of Rotheld, Cidone has risen to some prominence
within the standing armies of Earendam as a general.  Trained in Kor
Thrandir as a water templar, he carries some of their stereotypical chill
demeanor on his stern face.  As tall as any of the nobles of Earendam,
Cidone\@s frame is mostly muscle, from years of wearing armor.  His hair has
gone all steel-grey, which does little to add warmth to his countenance.  He
bears a thin longsword on his hip, always at the ready.  With the end of the
Scourge, he acts as an advisor to the Patrician on matters of war.

Moreth Edeno templar man dark etcandidate~
Moreth Edeno~
A dark-haired man with perfect posture stands here, hands behind his back.
~
Coming to the head of the house of Edeno at an unusually young age,
Moreth still has a particularly youthful countenance.  His dark, nearly
black hair is worn a bit long in a fashionable style, and despite his
serious face, the shape of his mouth seems one inclined to smiles.  His
stance is textbook- perfect, though he carries himself like a man more
heavy-set than his slender frame, typical of the Earendam nobility,
suggests.  A fervent dedicant of Iandir, Moreth has served as a legal
advisor on the Patrician\@s Council since rising to the head of his house,
abandoning his training in the priesthood when called.

A tall, dark-eyed aelin tends the shop from behind the counter.
~
A tall, dark-eyed aelin woman of obvious Harrudim descent tends this
smoky shop, long black hair swept in a fashionable style behind her back. 
She stays primarily behind the counter, but occasionally steps beyond,
gliding on pitch-dark wings to assist a customer with a purchase, speaking

A rotund corn vendor stands in front of a pushcart, roasting corn.
~
A rotund, bald human stands here, wearing a slightly worn and stained
apron.  He stands in front of a wheeled pushcart filled with corn, a small
metal grill set atop a gate-legged leaf.  He seems to be doing a fairly
quick business, steadily adding new corn to the grill as he sells the old,
taking the time between to season his product, or other small tasks.

Liriya~
A petite blonde woman moves around the shop.
~
A petite blonde woman with her hair tied in an elegant bun, Liriya has
made remarkable headway into Earendam\@s fashion scene in a very short amount
of time.  Denying all allegations that she is Silver Griffin-trained and her
distinctive scents at least partially illusionary, her complex fragrances
have earned her much attention.  Unsatisfied with the basic one-note floral
fragrances that had previously dominated the perfumer\@s trade, she works
tirelessly not only at producing new formulae, but also in maintaining her
own shop.

a pudgy shuddeni~
A pudgy shuddeni tends a cart of oversize bugs and grubs.
~
Unusual for one of his race, this shuddeni man is quite pudgy.  An
explanation lies easily at hand, though, as he purveys a remarkable variety
of shuddeni delicacies.  Against all odds, he seems to do a quick business
of selling the grubs and bugs.  This likely is owed foremost to location,
near to the Temple of Darkness and the Conclave of the Aklaju, with the
Company of the Serpent not far north, as well.  Also drawing in customers is
a distinct aspect of showmanship-- he has abandoned more conventional
cooking tools, and instead sears the seasoned bugs to order with jets of
flame from his hands.

an elegant aelin woman~
A statuesque blonde aelin is here, clad in an emerald green dress.
~
An elegant aelin woman is here, aloft on pitch-black wings.  Her golden
hair is styled with immaculate precision, flattering her otherwise narrow
face.  Her emerald eyes match her long, flowing dress, better suited to a
ballroom than daily wear.  An ornate golden belt hangs at her waist, holding
the folds of her dress in place.  She is very tall, with an imperious
posture that seems only accented by the fact that no more than the tips of
her shoes ever seem to touch the ground.

A slender aelin waitress lingers by the staircase between orders.
~
This slender aelin woman is dressed in the flattering uniform of a
waitress, moving swiftly between the kitchens and the tables, taking and
delivering orders with graceful ease.  Oddly, between orders she lingers by
the staircase and not the kitchens, but even this becomes more obvious as
she ushers those who have not paid away from the upstairs.

A wiry aelin man lounges on one of the cushions, one eye glancing about the room.
~
Dressed in dark but well-tailored clothes, this slender aelin man lounges
almost lazily in one of the piles of cushions, a drink close at hand. 
Despite this, he looks unusually alert, eyes taking in all activity in the
room.  Notably, he partakes of his drink but rarely, only enough to remain
on the barest outskirts of social drinking.

~
A tall caladaran woman stands here, long, mahogany-coloured hair falling
in kinks down past her shoulders.  Far taller than usual even for a woman,
she does not seem particularly imposing at the first glance, or even second,
but the longer one remains in her presence, the greater an aura of pensive
serenity surrounding her becomes obvious.  Her eyes are a deep, distant
blue, with an almost dizzying depth, and even a single glance from them
creates an unshakable certainty that there is nothing they miss.

Yaesuna Iasar~
A tiny blonde aelin sits in meditation on a moss-covered rock.
~
The last remaining scion of the wealthy house Iasar, Yaesuna returned
from her studies at the Hakurah Monastery several years ago.  While her
contemplative nature, open Jalassan faith, and unfashionably short hair
would suggest a certain personal austerity, her impressive political acumen
has led to her ascendence within the Four Flowers school of psionics.  She
has taken quickly to the intrigues of Earendam and its guilds, and in little
time, has also acquired a whispered reputation for certain scandalous
romantic entanglements.

a grey-robed acolyte~
A young caladaran in a grey robe tends the receiving desk.
~
A tall, willowy caladaran tends the receiving desk here, occasionally
getting up to tend the flowers or carefully arrange a new vase.  As guests
and students enter and exit the School, she does not even look up but
somehow perfectly discerns those who belong within and those who do not. 
When she speaks, it hardly seems as though her lips move at all.

This slender monk sits cross-legged on a mat, eyes closed as he
meditates.  His robe drapes loosely around himself, hood raised to hide his
hair.  At times, he chants quietly to himself, to aid in his focus on
matters of both the mind and greater enlightenment.  Aside from that, he
sits still as a statue, shoulders barely rising as he takes slow, measured
breaths.

Ilea Sirie~
A pearl-bedecked aelin busies herself about the shop.
~
A recent Ilodaiyan expatriate, noted couturier Ilea Sirie is rumoured to
have accepted a personal invitation from the Lady Vaelania herself to set up
her workshop here.  Bringing her daring takes on classical aelin designs
from the skyways of the High City to Earendam, she has already secured the
patronage of several majour aelin merchants who operate nearby.  She herself
exemplifies the styles she designs, her dark hair cut short enough to shock
society both local and foreign, but styled in purely feminine curls.  A long
rope of pearls loops around and around her neck, matching the cluster of
pearls in her ears.

salad cheese tomatoes caprese basil~
Rather than being set on lettuce, this salad uses a fragrant, leafy green
herb instead.  Thin, round slices of a white cheese are alternated with
juicy tomato slices, and the salad is dressed with pepper and a dark, sweet
vinegar.

On the Character of the Planar Beings of Earth:
  
As is well known, the scholars of earth have used
servants from that elemental plane since the 
dawning of their art. According to myth, elementals
were even used in the construction of parts of the old 
city, helping to build the city\@s walls when labor grew
scarce.
  
Little has been written about the nature of the common
elemental, however, and I have written this text to 
make a general study of the subject. 
  
Now, unlike those who dabble in the void, we do not 
call our elemental servants unwillingly into the 
prime material, nor do we threaten or bribe them. 
Rather, most elementals of earth actually crave the 
unfamiliar taste of matter in the prime material, and 
enjoy helping scholars create new structures of
matter, or rearrange existing structures.
  
This taste for exotic matter is possible because 
elementals as such do not transfer their physical 
matter from the plane of earth -- to do so would require
opening a stable gateway to that plane, which would 
require far more concentration and mana expenditure.
  
Rather, when an elemental is summoned, the animus, 
or animating spirit of an elemental is conjured, and 
they inhabit a shell of matter in the prime material. Of
course, the power and versatility of the spirit called 
will depend on the proximity of the caster to the plane
of earth. It is well known that elementals within
caves or fissures have greater strength, resulting in 
this property.*



The rest of the text concerns technical matters, 
including various tests of hardness and magical 
strength.

An excerpt from \#A History of Earendam the Grand: Portrait of a City and
its Times..\#  

By Jofis Tabr, historian and scholar

The fortunes of Earendam in the centuries following the War of Night would
bring it from Republic to city-state, from feared to contented, and from
mythic to legendary.  And yet, despite its decline in fortunes, this city
was and continues to remain the heart of human culture in Avendar.  

Purported to have been founded after the War of Fire, it is certainly the
oldest known city founded by humans.  Beginning as a fishing village built
on the banks of the Dantaron, and near the shores of the Uthlin, Earendam
had long been a center for trade and council among primitive men, even
before the War of Fire.  

After the war, the human templars and sorcerers who had lead their people
against the aelin met with death and exiles.  The vast majority of humanity,
tired of war and conflict, settled with relative ease under the leadership
of the likes of Aramril and Salyra.  

Earendam\@s rise to power is not the subject of this treatise, but it is
sufficient to know that those who associated with the ancient banner of the
blue and white rose brought with them more than force of arms, or powerful
magic.  With them rode the tide of culture, and the force of its coming
changed the face of Avendar.  

By the time of the War of Night, the Republic embraced most of the main
continent of Avendar, with ties to the mountain strongholds of the aelin,
and the more primitive ethron.  Moralists among the priests of Jolinn and
Iandir decried the onset of decadence in the people and the government of
Earendam.  With most frontiers closed, the eyes of Earendam turned inward,
desperately seeking some novelty, some new thing, to come from within.  

At the war\@s end, some predicted a new golden age for the Republic,
supported by the new magics of spirits and united by the threat of the
shuddeni.  Few counted on these very factors forming the foundation for the
fall of the Republic.  

The new magics used in the War of Night had a deeper influence on the
culture of the Republic than might have been expected.  It was not a matter
of citizens summoning demons or speaking to dead relatives, but rather the
more subtle powers of the magic that began the process.  The simpler magics
of void allowed for easy travel across vast distances, as well as the
similar powers of the scholars of spirit.  Knowledge traveled quickly and
easily between cities, and fractious and dissident thought proliferated. 
When the magics of air came into the second century, traditional trading
practices also were turned on their head, with a proliferation of free-lance
traders and handler of goods.  

At the same time, the threat of the shuddeni actually served to increase
factionalism in the Republic.  Different city-states offered varying
proposals for dealing with their defeated enemies.  Most supported some
variety of a containment policy, but more radical opinions ranged from
conciliation (often heard from those cities occupied by the shuddeni) to a
campaign of extermination (as advocated by extreme elements in the clergy of
Jolinn).  The political divisions over the \#shuddeni\# problem lead to
Earendam being forced to garrison fortresses such as Kor Thrandir with their
own troops and supplies, greatly weakening an already diminished military. 


This period of decline continued until circa three centuries ago, when a ten
year period of long winters and poor harvests intensified political unrest
in the Republic to the breaking point.  Provinces in the south began to
revolt, refusing to supply the already overpopulated Earendam with the
tribute and food it desperately needed.  In the north, a new breed of
kankorans had migrated from across the Uthlin, lead by fierce far leaders
and fighting with a fanatical desperation.  Trade disputes with Var Bandor
further alienated Earendam from the western provinces, and turmoil over the
open worship of the dark gods caused a furor in Earendam itself.  

When the kankorans began a long and bloody series of campaigns in the
northlands, Earendam\@s military proved unable to satisfactorily deal with
the menace.  Caught unprepared, and lead by generals who had never had
actual experience in battle.  Caught in the itinerant raids lead by
barbarian warlords, Earendam\@s army was defeated in a long series of bloody
battles, and driven back to the walls of the city itself.  

In what is most likely the low point of Earendam\@s history, most of the
ruling Senate fled the city, fearing for their own lives.  The citizens
rallied under the leadership of a man named Corvandil Novis, head of one of
the city\@s oldest noble houses.  While the ensuing battle ravaged the
northern half of Earendam, the battle put an end to the kankoran presence in
the area for the next two hundred years.  

In the aftermath of what became known as the First Kankoran War, Earendam
was forced out of political necessity to cede its claim to the far reaching
provinces of the Republic, and the leadership of the city passed from the
Senate (now in disgrace) to a ruling Patrician, which became a lifetime
leader selected from among the city\@s nobility.  

For those that balk at the thought of the social institutions of a Republic
changing so thoroughly, let us not forget the stresses Earendam faced, and
the fact that the institution of the Patrician mimicked the long- standing
familial order of the city-dwellers, where a single rich noblemen would
support many by his largesse.  For these reasons, some have gone beyond the
claim that the office was born of necessity, but rather, the role of the
Patrician was a cultural inevitability.  

Despite these changes, the unified voice that the Patrician brought to
Earendam\@s politics lead to an unprecedented growth.  The north side of the
city was rebuilt, in part using the magics of earth, and changes in the laws
regarded trade resulting in a small merchant class flourishing.  Artisans
and scholars once more came to Earendam, viewing it once more as a bastion
of culture.  [In this humble author\@s opinion, Var Bandorian scholars choose
to live in a cesspool].

On the Crouble-Gralci Funnel
  
As Belerin, the preeminent scholar of the planes, has recorded, the ancient
alatharya were known to have accessed many planes, including the plane of
air (see Belerin\@s comprehensive work \#Codex of the Planes\#, for a more
detailed discussion of planar travel in general).  The methods the ancients
used are not known, being among the countless treasures of lore lost in the
sundering.  Nonetheless, archmages post-sundering have discovered one manner
of ingress into the border regions of the plane of air.  
  
The method of entering these regions was found quite by accident.  Two air
archmages, Crouble and Gralci, were testing the effects of bringing various
substances of air and earth into conflict.  On a whim, Gralci used an
enchanted dagger of electrum upon a djinni.  When the djinni\@s death-blow
was dealt, a highly unusual funnel was formed.  As the funnel lasts only the
briefest of moments, it took another several years of reproducing and
studying the phenomenon to discover that it may serve (should one be quick
enough to enter) as a portal.  
  
The regions into which the funnel leads are the near-intersections of the
plane of air and the prime material.  They are chaotic realms of air,
vapors, gases, and mists, lorded over by mighty djinn caliphs.  Mortals will
find their senses at a loss, as without physical landmarks, compass
directions in the chaotic expanse are all but meaningless.  Denizens of the
plane fly about, and are, with a few exceptions, quite hostile to mortal
visitors.  Vortexes of poisonous gas and noxious vapors are also extremely
dangerous, if not immediately fatal.  Meandering currents snake throughout
the region, perhaps serving as roads of sorts to the dwellers of the plane. 
Of the three principle currents, the fierce, the unsteady, and the turbulent,
it is said that only those following the turbulent current have returned 
alive to the prime material.

Aquisitions of Alchemical Power
by Parcaldia
  
You who are skilled in alchemy, and as many others as promise
yourselves great riches or chiefly desire to make gold and 
silver through your efforts, which Alchemy in different ways
promises and teaches, and equally, too, you who willingly 
undergo toil and vexations, and wish not to be freed from them,
until  you have attained your rewards, and the fulfilment of
the  promises made to you; experience teaches this every day,
that out of thousands of you not even one accomplishes his
desire. Is this a failure of nature or of the art? I say, no--
but it is  rather the fault of fate, or of the unskilfulness
of the student.
   
Since, therefore, the characters of the sign of element and
power, together with the essence, recipes, materials, and
form are thoroughly well known to such as are acquainted with
this art, it would be altogether superfluous to recur to these
same subjects in the present text, although the use of such at
the proper time is by no means without advantage.
   
This, indeed, will not give scope for a pompous parade of words,
but, nevertheless, in the consideration of those immutable laws

You who are skilled in alchemy, and as many others as promise
yourselves great riches or chiefly desire to make gold and 
silver through your efforts, which Alchemy in different ways
promises and teaches, and equally, too, you who willingly 
undergo toil and vexations, and wish not to be freed from them,
until  you have attained your rewards, and the fulfilment of
the  promises made to you; experience teaches this every day,
that out of thousands of you not even one accomplishes his
desire. Is this a failure of nature or of the art? I say, no--
but it is  rather the fault of fate, or of the unskilfulness
of the student.
   
Since, therefore, the characters of the sign of element and
power, together with the essence, recipes, materials, and
form are thoroughly well known to such as are acquainted with
this art, it would be altogether superfluous to recur to these
same subjects in the present text, although the use of such at
the proper time is by no means without advantage.

The Advisings of Elchin
 He Being of the First of the Disciples of Urbergeron,
 and One Who Has Walked Fully down the Path of Mastery
   
Now I do not wonder, as I did before, why philosophers of the art,
having attained knowledge by experience in full, have not cared to
have their days shortened (although by the virtue of their work they
could have prolonged them) for every true philosopher has all so
clearly set before his eyes, as your face is seen in a glass. Thus
much by way of reply to the frivolous objections of those that
believe not the verity of this art, who hold arcane word and gesture
to be superior to true substance. If you should discover to them the 
process of the common alchemic stone, let alone that great prize
long sought by many, they would laugh at your simplicity, and I
will warrant you never make use of it. Nay, if you should animate
the substance before them, they would think that even in that there
was a fallacy, so wedded to their scholarship of unbelief they are.
So I find them, and so I leave them, and shall forever find them
the same. And although some students of the art, possessed with 
foolish notions, dream that the true matter is to be found only in
some  particular places, at such and such times of the year; yet we
are most certain (according to our master Urbergeron) that, all these
suppositions being false, it is to be found everywhere, at all
times, according to our lore and for our application. For in the
vision of Urbergeron, he saw an empty void of shadow, seperated from
the not-void only by a halo of spirit. Then came powers, of the
Ancient to Transmogrify, and so was wrought according to the will,
between shadow and light, the fundamental matters and energies of
Earth, Fire, Water, and Air (which, with life begun in Spirit and 
gnawed to consumption by Void, are Nature). And the powers utilized
and wrought are essence first, essence of element, essence of truest
being, with which all things resonate in degree according to their
very material stuff and according to the shaping of type. And so
there are nine of fundamental element, and nine is the chief and most
foremost number in the lore of he who would know. He who sees, of the
study and teaching of Urbergeron, can sense their influence in all.
Yet whosoever shall presume to obtain the height of this art, 
according to our most secret ways without the observing and 
understanding of Urbergeron, will certainly find himself mightily 
mistaken at last, having after a great deal of troubles, charges, 
and pains, reaped nothing but discontent; and on the contrary they,
that shall walk in our true and infallible lore, shall with very little
trouble and expenses attain their desired end, which we cordially
wish to all those who are sincere well-wishers to the alchemic 
philosophy. But the true student looks beyond the first essence of 
element to see all other aspects and virtue, vice and design which touch
the foundation of property. These number many and are known to none but 
the minds of those who command the ancient by will, and of their 
influence, are as lasting as the nine. And there is Alteration for 
Enhancement. And there is Detection from Beguilement. And there is 
Travel in the bounds of the Planar. And there is Healing of Damage. And
there is Benediction against Malediction. And there is Revelation from 
Obscurement. And there is Chaos against Order. And there is Protection
from Weather. And there is Knowledge from Mental. And there is Summoning
for Conjuration. And there is Breath of Time. And these in aspect shape
the making even as the element stands at the crux of essence to bring
about what the hands of the philosopher shall fashion. And this work of
the essence from its very beginning to its perfect end may, on our 
certain knowledge, be so perfected by any skillful and careful artist,
that knows the lore of Urbergeron, unless some accident should happen
in the preparation of our great works: which to prevent, we wrought 
them with care, and for better effect in a place of sufficient design
and material which is most agreeable to the practice of the wisest of
philosophers.

~
E
one~
THE CODE OF THE KNIGHTS OF ENAERAI

The Knights of Enaerai seek to uphold the balance in Avendar.  By persuasion
or by force, and acting as a unified military body, the Knights are ever
vigilant that no extreme influence disrupts the equilibrium and natural
balance as created when the three great powers first brought Avendar into
being.  

The Knights revere Enaerai, who is held as their guiding deity of balance,
though no active worship is required throughout the Order.  They also
observe Mettenday, the first calendar day of every month on the standard
Avendarian calendar, as a day of rest, recuperation, and assembly.  No
efforts to actively enforce balance are made by the Knights on Mettenday. 
The Knights are based in the city of Earendam, in a compound adjunct to the
Temple of Enaerai.  

REQUIREMENTS OF KNIGHTHOOD

Adventurers who are neutral in both alignment and ethos may become Knights
of Enaerai.  However, scholars who practice the greater spells of spirit or
void, and templars of those spheres, may not seek entrance to the
Knighthood.  To join the Knights of Enaerai, seek out members of the order
and petition them for entrance.  Knights may be recognized by the symbol of
Enaerai--the eye within a triangle.  

THE OFFICES OF KNIGHTHOOD

The organization of the Knighthood is straightforward, run with the
efficiency and manner one would expect of a military order.  Knights heed
the directions of their superiors without question, sacrificing life and
even soul to the cause.  

The Knight Lord leads the Knights.  He or she is the highest officer and
supreme commander of the Knights, maintaining the order of the knighthood
and directing them in actions to right the balance.  

There are up to three captains of the Knights, who vote for the new Lord
should the office be absent.  Each is also given the leadership of the Mett,
Idris, or Ilthar divisions of the Knights.  

The Captain of Mett is charged with subterfuge, spying, scouting, and
providing necessary reconnaissance, as well as leading the rogue component
and other miscellaneous forces of the Knight body.  

The Captain of Idris pools and compiles knowledge regarding adventurers in
the land and their effects on the balance, and the balance between houses,
as well as leading the magical or scholarly forces of the Knight body.  

The Captain of Ilthar is charged with being the second, under the Knight
Lord, to direct in battle, to administer punishment of final death to
renegade Knights who have broaken their oaths of Knighthood, and to lead the
warrior forces of the Knight body.  
~
E
two~
THE PRIEST OF ENAERAI

In the temple of Enaerai in Earendam, a priest tends the altar.  He will
also occasionally grant his blessings and spells upon Knights who are in the
temple.  

Like most temple priests, he can heal for a price, but he\@ll also grant
benedictions and heal wounds for Knights, of his own accord, and when his
duties permit.  

The priest will also hold items for the Knights, though he will drop
artifacts of great power (such as the Stones of Power) as such items have
the potential to influence the balance and should not be in the temple.  

If a Knight wishes to request the last item given to the priest, the Knight
may do the following: 

request

Finally, when a Knight prays in the presence of the priest in the temple,
the Knight will be able to discern whether Enaerai is near to the realm of
mortals and the prayer is heard, or whether she is distant.  If she is
distant, the priest will take note of the prayer, and Enaerai will receive
the prayer at a later time, when she once more draws near to the mortal
realm.  
~
E
three~
THE KNIGHT GUARD

In the temple of Enaerai, a Knight stands guard at the doors of the
compound.  He will permit only Knights to pass the doors, and those the
Knights wish to invite within the compound.  If Knights wish to invite
someone into the compound, they may say the following: 

escort <name>

The guard will alert all Knights when others attempt to force their way into
the compound, and will also attack renegades of the Knighthood on sight.  
~
E
four~
ADMINISTERING THE KNIGHT OATH

The worthy applicant traditionally stands in the gold ring before the Knight
Lord (or Captain, in the Lord\@s absence).  The applicant is questioned
regarding their desire to take the oath, whether it is done of their own
volition, and whether they understand the consequenses of breaking the oath.


If the applicant gives satisfactory answers, the adminstrator of the oath
questions: \#Will you take the oath upon yourself now?\#  The applicant must
respond \#I will\# (and should be informed beforehand that those are the
proper ceremonial words, without which the oath stone will not bind the
oath).  

This done, the administrator of the oath uses the oath stone in the
following manner: 

oath knight <name>

~
E
five~
ADMINISTERING THE CAPTAIN OATH

Traditionally, the candidate for the captaincy stands in the gold ring
before the Knight Lord (or another Captain, in the Lord\@s absence).  The
candidate is formally charged with directing and upholding the work of the
division they are to direct.  The administrator then questions: \#Will you
pledge to faithfully serve Enaerai and the balance as Knight Captain?\#  The
candidate must respond \#I will\# (and should be informed beforehand that
those are the requisite ceremonial words that must be uttered, for the oath
stone to bind the ceremony).  

This done, the administrator of the oath uses the oath stone in the
following manner: 

oath captain <name> 

~
E
six~
ADMINISTERING THE LORD OATH

At least two Knight Captains must agree on the candidate for the Knight
Lord position, and the prospective Knight Lord given the oath by another
Captain, for the oath ceremony and granting of rank to be considered 
valid before Enaerai.

As with the other oath ceremonies, the candidate stands in the gold ring,
before a Knight Captain.  The candidate is formally charged with directing
the Knighthood and taking responsibility for the balance of Avendar before
Enaerai.  The Captain then questions: \#Will you accept this charge?\# 
The candidate must respond \#I will\# (and should be informed beforehand that
those are the necessary words to be uttered, for the oath stone to bind the
ceremony).

This done, the administrator of the oath uses the oath stone in the
following manner:

oath lord <name>
~
E
seven~
DEMOTING AN OFFICER OF THE KNIGHTS

For whatever reason, if a leader among the Knights is to be demoted or
returned to standard Knight status, the administrator, before the oath
stone, asks the Knight whether they accept the removal of office.  The
Knight must respond \#I accept\# (and should be so informed), and then the
administrator binds the act through use of the oath stone, as follows:

oath knight <name> 

~
E
eight~
NAMING A RENEGADE KNIGHT

Only the Knight Lord may declare a Knight to be renegade and oathbreaker. 
Normally, Knights accused of oathbreaking are given warning and an
opportunity to defend themselves (in a simple court, as directed by the
Lord).  The naming of renegade is a last resort, to declare to the Knight
that their mortal life, which is sworn to Enaerai, is forfeit.  When a
Knight is judged to be renegade, and is present in the realm, the Knight
Lord uses the oathstone in the following manner: 

renegade <name>

~
E
nine~
USE OF THE SCALE OF ORLIN

The Knight Lord is given charge to care for and instruct Knights in the use
of the Scale of Orlin.  The Scale of Orlin is a complex instrument, only
understood by those dedicated to Enaerai and in the knight order.  It
measures the balance between good and evil, between law and chaos, and
between the strength of the houses.  It gives priority to the measure in
that order, as should the Knights.  The scale is used in the following
manner:

consult scale

THE SIGIL OF ENAERAI


Knights receive the sigil of Enaerai, a mark depicting the Eye of
Enaerai symbol, when they first take the oath of Knighthood upon
themselves.  For some, particularly those Knights who would find
themselves within the division of the Mett, the sigil may not be
visible, but exists nonetheless.

The sigil grants Knights a small measure of protection from holy and
negative powers, as well as a slight increase of combat abilities.
It also assists in communications among the Knight Order.  Knights
may speak to each other in the following manner:

 knighttell <message>  or kt <message>

Those who wear the sigil can also address a note to all Knights by 
doing the follwing:

On Restoring the Balance
by High Lord Tessolos

  \#The Knights of Enaerai seek to uphold the balance in
   Avendar.  By persuasion or by force, and acting as a
   unified military body, the Knights are ever vigilant
   that no extreme influence disrupts the equilibrium
   and natural balance as created when the three great
   powers first brought Avendar into being.\#

When the balance is in jeopardy, what action must Knights take? The lines
above, penned into the Code by Orlin the Founder, serve as a guide.
Knights present in the realm, under the direction of any leaders also
present, together are sworn to act against the imbalance and set it aright.

It is known that the wandering guild adventurers offer the greatest
potential for destabilizing (and rectifying) the balance.  And so it is
primarily upon the adventurers of Avendar that the Knights must focus
their attention, doing all in their power to drive forth those who disrupt
balance, and to encourage and strengthen the lesser side of the scale.

In some cases, persuasion suffices--those who would remain friendly the
Knight Order may choose to depart rather than be driven by force.  Many
a time bloodshed may be avoided through discussion, or making other
sorts of arrangements or agreements (with those who would hold true to
such agreements) that also bring the scales back into proper harmony.

But more often, force is required, and thus we are organized into a
military body, to maximize effiency in that regard.  Those who resist
the efforts of Knights, to depart the land or face the blades and spells
of the Knight Order, choose for themselves.  It is known that the ghosts
of mortals weight but little, if at all, upon the scales, and so the 
duty of the  Knights is clear with regard to force.

That is not to say that a Knight is required to suicide against a
superior force, for that would not accomplish the goals of the order, 
and is foolishness.  But in such a situation, the Knight would of 
course be actively working, strategizing, and doing everything within
his or her power to strengthen the force or element opposing the imbalance,
and preparing himself or herself to be able meet the imbalance 
with sufficient force to drive it from the land.

Knights who see no easy way to rectify the balance, and then turn to
their own needs and desires--guild advancement, seeking honors, glory,
or gold and items of power--dishonor their vows, unless such actions
will clearly and directly aid them in preparing for and battling
the superior force.

I have known of Knights who have, with the balance in jeopardy, 
gone upon their way, working toward guild advancement and 
otherwise neglecting to give heed to the work of restoration.
Such faithless and callow fools all eventually wind up the same--as
oathbreakers, outcasts of the order, and hunted by the true
servants of balance.

A long, polished steel halberd rests here.~
At the base of the shaft, this halberd bears the mark of the Earendamian
noble house of Edeno.  As a weapon itself, there is very little special to
be seen about it; it seems to be used as a replacement showpiece for when
the treasured Edeno family halberd is stolen by gangs of marauding
adventurers.

A loose silken shirt, meant to wrap around the body in the aelin manner, has been left here.~
The aelin with their wings are known for disdaining tunics and shirts
that are pulled over the head largely for being awkward around the wings. 
Wing-slits cut into garments are often considered degrading for being
conventions that exist for the sole purpose of modifying the clothing of
other races to their bodies.  The preferred style amongst aelin is
inevitably to specifically design to accomodate this most distinct feature.

This hat is made of a particularly fine fur felt; by the soft nap and

animal native to the highlands of the far western continent and prized by
the aelin for the quality of its meat and its soft, sleek fur.  While not
native to the Dantaron river valley, several small herds have been imported
to the region to serve the needs of the small but wealthy expatriate
population.

neckline is high enough to do little more than suggest.  Both the long,
loose sleeves and flowing skirts are made from a myriad of layers of filmy,
translucent silk, only those layers giving the fabric enough opacity to give
appropriate modesty.  The style is such that the dress will billow and cloud
about when the wearer is airborne, though the skirt is loose enough to
accomodate something worn underneath, to prevent giving those below an
untoward eyeful.

This pair of boots is made of black leather, and polished to an almost

The student of the Bloodpyre -- by the heavens, what a needlessly

term - ah, but I digress already, and in writing no less.  I shan\@t cross it
out and start over, my hand cramps already.  To the point, then.  

The student of the...  Pyre should be advised that these are dangerous
magics not to be trifled with!  Infernal forces must always be kept closely
controlled and carefully watched, lest the unfortunate scholar who exercised
insufficient caution end up like the original Grandmaster Ash, for whom of

{WWreath of Flames{x

This potent effect will draw on the Inferno to increase the power of other
spells in our -- meaning fire magi, of course -- repertoire.  The most
obviously affected have been known as Coronal Glow, Immolation, Frenzy, and
Living Flame by those who care for such needless extravagance.  The details
of how to draw on this power are as...

For use with a pyre bound with diamond essence only:

{WFireflies{x

What a perfectly misleading name -- the swarms of fire imps called forth by
this conjuration may indeed look like \@fireflies\@ to the uninitiated, but
such vulgar diction demeans our Art.  Regardless, those who exercise this
power will find that few near the summoning can remain hidden or otherwise
obscured with so many glowing imps about them.  

I originally developed the expertise for this from the fire shamans of the
nefortu, those who dwell within the sea-caves, and would recommend to the
reader to also learn from their ways.  The nefortu may not be the most... 
Polite of creatures, but they have an uncanny knack for controlling fire
magics.  

After gaining this insight, burn away the eye of a powerful creature in the
pyre; this will attract the imps.  Be prepared to pay them next; a silver
piece each should suffice.  These imps are known to travel in cohorts of a
dozen dozens; \@twould be best to drop the full gross, lest they feel
shortchanged.  

{WBrimstone Conduit{x

Ah yes, the Conduit of Power or whatever name they give it these days; I can
not keep up with the constant debates.  Useful indeed for one who wishes to
draw often on the Heart of the Inferno.  

To make use of this conduit, one must incinerate a scroll of magical power
-- really any will do, releasing thereby its mystic energies into the
Inferno.  This will open the path from the pyre; by then dropping in
something formed of sulphur, the adept may draw power down this path and
into herself.  

I have heard tell that the nefortu of Kzaya-Ha are the only ones to have
truly perfected this spell, so should one seek a greater understanding
perhaps it may be found there.  For my part, I find it too difficult to
travel through Nendor since the Circle ruled against me after the incident
with...  Ah, but I do digress once more.  
~
E
prim4~
{WFlickerfyre{x

Much debate has gone into this effect; is it really true that Inferno can
burn away the lies surrounding us all, and allow glimpses into the past? 
Perhaps, but if so few have accomplished it, and fewer still written about
it.  For my part, I know only this about the ritual: 

If it were to work, it would need a pyre empowered with a diamond and
burning whitely, and before anything from the past could be brought to light
the mists of obscurity must first be removed.  Towards that end, I suspect
that one would first need to incinerate an item made of water, and another
of smoke.  Beyond that point I can offer no advice.

Forged of bronze and glass, this odd device is one of a very few
originally crafted by the famed archmage Salyra for the purpose of
deciphering her own notes.  It is rumored that she felt some of the magics
and knowledge she had unearthed to be too dangerous to be widespread, and so
ensured that only those she trusted be able to read her memoirs by providing
only them with machines such as these.  This particular specimen of shining
metal and lens plates has been well-tended if not often used.

The art of runic magic, it is presumed, dates back to ancient alatharya
times, to the days of the prehistoric magi.  In that long-gone era before
the sundering, the true Names of most things were known -- or rapidly
becoming known -- to those timeless sages.  This consequently led to
tremendous power and achievement, but also great hubris.  Some, it is
believed, sought out the true Names of the gods themselves, and were cast
down for it; though whether the divine were motivated by wrath at such
arrogance or simple fear that it was not unjustified is a matter of some
debate.  

These stories are new only to the youngest of babes, and have furthermore
doubtless changed in the many generations of retelling.  Those few who now
know what truly happened rarely speak of it, and perhaps for the better. 
But what we know for certain is that knowledge of true Names does indeed
grant power, and though most such Names have been lost to us -- and indeed,
even the proper language in which to speak them -- some evidence of that
ancient art remains.  And thus we proceed to runic magic.  
~
E
musty3~
By carving out a true Name -- however imperfectly -- onto a stone, the
skilled may invoke a portion of its power.  Alas that the very means of
discovering new Names has been lost to us; nonetheless, some remnant of
those already learned has been passed down [See Appendix].  These runes,
therefore, may be inscribed into the living earth, so as to gain this power.

Empowering such symbols has always been a daunting task, and not for the
weak of mind.  Besides the years of training required to learn how, even
basic runes can be quite taxing to maintain.  Despite this, their undeniable
utility has spawned considerable interest in the dissemination of this
knowledge.  
~
E
musty4~
While a mage must be in contact with a rune to invoke it, once the power
has been lent the scholar may release it at any time, regardless of
distance.  Indeed, many of the great stories [See Klipus, 347] refer to the
sacrifices of those magi who held their concentration on an ally\@s runes
long enough to preserve the friend, though losing their own lives in the
process.  And no small number of such tales revolve around the magi who
failed to do so.  Legends or not, the bond the mage has with these runes is
undeniable.  

Learning to carve such runes can be a task indeed, and is traditionally
divided into two formal areas of study.  All of those who pledge full
membership in most modern earth guilds are instructed in the basic carvings,
sufficient to empower simple runes of no more than a single syllable.  Those
rare few who dedicate their lives to the art, however, may learn even the
complex polysyllabic runes; or at least those which remain to be found.

Runes known to our Art:

Strength: enables greater physical power, slightly improving strikes and
significantly aiding with carrying heavy weights.  See illustration on last
page for details.  

Bind: protects the bearer with binding magics, causing those who strike him
to fall from flight.  

Truth: known to provide excellent resistance to illusory magics, and to
empower the bearer to banish certain phantasms with simple strikes.  

Sunder: empowers the bearer\@s strikes to harm the mental reserves of his
foe, in addition to the physical harm.  

Erosion: though this rune is known to exist, its purpose remains a mystery. 


Ground: wards the bearer from lightning

Stone: shields the bearer from physical damage

Tremor: as with Erosion, its use remains undocumented.  

Editor\@s Note: many more runes are believed to still exist in the world;

Here is set forth, in concise format, the major influences of every formally 
recognised artistic period of Avendarian history. The reader will, I trust, 
forgive my somewhat dry and direct discourse in this presentation. My 
intention is to provide a work of reference, rather than a subjective 
commentary of the field - for such a treatise, the reader is encouraged to 
refer to the author\@s autobiography:

                 The Periods of Avendarian Art

The listed races for each art period are those who principally created and 
participated in that period, and is by no means exclusive. Artists of every 
race were to be found to participate in many styles, even if their final 
contributions to the developement of that period was limited. 

Little is known about the historical developement of shuddeni art, as it did 
not appear on the surface until just previous to and during the War of Night. 
The modern alatharya tend not to engage in artistic pursuits, beyond the 
crudest adaptions of primitive styles, so they are not listed beyond their 
first mention.

- Experimentations in shape
- Caladaran

NOTE: When the word \#Detamnat\# is spoken, most will think of the developed 
caladaran ceramic art, instead of its actual beginnings in superstition. It 
no longer has any purpose besides ornamental telling of history.

                 ----------------------------------

Slirucasro (aelin - quintessence)
- Worked mostly on canvas, some sculpture
- Began to stray from religious topics
- Skill of the artist become more important
- Studies of still life and form very common
- Buildings again become more ornate
- Aelin, Human

                 ----------------------------------

Aelin Hisilan (aelin - revelry)
- Worked mostly on canvas, some sculpture
- Art begins to become a bit frivolous in the attention given to detail
- Part of the worth of the piece is how clever it is, how many subtle stories 
  or messages lie within it
- Aelin

                 ----------------------------------

Ashi Uzitha (shuddeni - beautiful darkness)
- Work on canvas, cloth, and some sculpture
- Brought from the shuddeni caves
- Typically dark scenes of horror and torture, but where it melds into a 
  beautiful composition
- Proportion was often extended or changed, to fit the piece compositionally
- Human, Shuddeni (mostly sculpture)

               ==================================
~
E
4~
==================================

Krag Uzitha (shuddeni - living darkness)
- Work on canvas, cloth, and sculpture
- During the war many artists were commisioned to do works for the newly 
  conquered cities
- As during the Ashi Uzitha period, the works were of torture and suffering
- Aelin, Human, Shuddeni (sculpture mostly)

NOTE: Some Nefortu created works of Krag Uzitha, but mostly in tapestry. 
Many scholars don\@t consider the Nefortu work truly Krag Uzitha, but their 
content and the time usually puts them in this period.

There are two main differences between the Ashi Uzitha and Krag Uzitha 
periods:
- Krag Uzitha pieces are sometimes set outside, often during the day
- Krag Uzitha proportion is more regulated and realistic looking, owing to 
  the influence of the Aelin Hisilan period.

                 ----------------------------------

Celestial (Same time as the Th\@cirre Mel period)
- Work on a variety of mediums
- Not as strictly realistic as in the Aelin Hisilan and Slirucasro periods, 
  more sketchy and fast
- Lighter colours, little shadow or darkness
- Content was spiritual and fantasic in nature
- Scenes of wonder and magic, or the enlightenment of self
- Ch\@taren sometimes set alongside beings of myth or the gods themselves 
  (although no ch\@taren artist is recorded to have represented their race as 
  divine)
- Aelin, Human, Ch\@taren

                 ----------------------------------

Th\@cirre Mel (ch\@taren - common man)
- Work done on board, canvas, and cloth
- Bright colours
- Loosely realistic as in the Celestial period
- Clear shapes, little shading
- Content tends to be the common man, happy scenes of everyday life
- Human, Ch\@taren

                 ----------------------------------

Late Jaranber
- Paintings on animal skins, tents, clothing
- Bold shapes and colours, more abstract in style than earlier kankoran art
- Used as decoration, but not as formal \#art\#
- Last signifigant advancement in Kankoran art
- Kankoran

                 ----------------------------------

Pastoral
- Work done on canvas and board
- People began to focus more on the outside world
- Content usually a landscape, sometimes done of villages and small towns
- Human, Ch\@taren, Caladaran

                 ----------------------------------

Ulidsa (aelin - linear)
- Work done on canvas and board
- Focus changes from nature to the cities
- Strict rules of perspective and detail, very linear
- Again becomes more precise, less hazy
- Aelin, Human

                 ----------------------------------

Ayajli (nefortu - infinite)
- Work done in tapestry, weaving
- Focused on intricate infinite patterns within the tapestry instead of the 
  pictures and scenes of the past
- Wide variety of colours, with hundreds and thousands of threads in shades 
  of every used colour.
- Nefortu

                 ----------------------------------

Aeh Pastoral (aelin - beyond)
- Work done on canvas and board
- Somewhat of a backlash against the confined style of Ulidsa
- Return to outside world, though on a more grand scale than in Pastoral
- Most works of this period focus on the sky
- Landscape becomes insignifigant, takes up only 10-20% of the painting
- Aelin, Human, Ch\@taren

               ==================================
~
E
5~
==================================

Neopious
- Work done on canvas, board, sculpture, and some relief
- Again the focus turns to the heavens, though the style is more relaxed than 
  in the earlier Pious periods
- Stories told of gods and men, and spiritual pieces
- Aelin, Human, Ch\@taren

                 ----------------------------------

High Th\@cirre Mel
- Work done on board, canvas, cloth, and some sculpture
- Demands that focus be put on man and his emotions instead of the world 
  around him
- Bright colours
- Somewhat flat shapes with little shading
- Common man going about a happy day
- Often depicts scenes of taverns, games, picnics, and other lighthearted 
  activities
- Human, Ch\@taren, Ethron

                 ----------------------------------

Oreinn (common - passion) - Current
- Work done on board, canvas, cloth, and some sculpture
- The same lighthearted feel as High Tel\@cirre, though with even more 
  frivolous and sensual overtones
- Somewhat detailed, though there is still the loose feeling to the work 
  stemming back to the Celestial period
- Human, Ch\@taren, Ethron

                 ----------------------------------

Pones (common - heaven) - Current
- Work done on board, canvas, sculpture, and relief
- Developement of Neopious goals, turning back towards the Aelin Hisilan 
  attention to detail
- The gods are portrayed in their many faces and stages, always with 
  reverence
- Aelin, Human, Caladaran

NOTE: The two schools of art currently are very divided.  They are essentially 
teaching two different moral schools; Love life versus love those who gave you 
life, though really they are not so different in the end.

==================================

         A Guide to the Principal Contributions of the Races

Aelin - Responsible for many leaps ahead in the understanding of form, partly 
due to their preserved knowledge from the ancient alatharya.

Alatharya - There are few alatharya artists. The level of artistic
developement of the ancient alatharya is poorly known, although the
few pieces remain suggest it to be considerable

Caladaran - Famed for their ceramic pottery, especially that from the High 
Detamnat period.

Ch\@taren - Inspired the Celestial period, and a looser style of drawing.

Ethron - Known for exceptional carving skills.

Kankorans - Dyed and painted leather and animal skins, only notable art 
developement was in the Jaranber period.

Human - Have contributed to the largest range of styles and periods, for the 
most part after the War of Fire.

Nefortu - Contributions limited, but are known for their intricate patterned 
tapestries.

Shuddeni - Mutated proportions to make beautiful compositions, sculptural 
pieces and reliefs, concentrating on themes of horror.

Srryn - Mostly decorative clothing with teeth, skin, and scales. Little in 
the way of formal art.

The Coalition for the Non-Suck Earendam~
This room is scattered with various maps and charts, depicting versions
of both the old Earendam and the new.  Pasted to the wall is a poster of
Regalas, peppered with various daggers and darts.  Across a low shelf, a
crystal bust of the Neurotic Goddess of Fugue States lays shattered into a
thousand tiny pieces.  From an open window, you can hear the death cries of
spoiled little girls, men with top hats, and the infamous \#Galadon
Crematorium\#.

The Western Arien Plaza~
The Arien Plaza comes to an end here as it approaches the western gate of
Earendam.  Travelers and merchants head out through this gate onto the
Arien road, bringing goods to and from the lands to the west.  Set in the
northwestern portion of the city, this plaza is a square ringed on all
sides by the buildings and walls of New Earendam.  Paved with cobblestones
long worn smooth by the feet of travelers entering the city from the Arien
road, the center of the square lies eastward, where an ornate fountain
serves as a resting place for the main body of the populace in the immediate
area.  Shops line the northern edge of the square, while southward the plaza
eventually terminates in a stone wall.

The Center of Arien Plaza~
The Arien plaza stretches in all directions around this point.  From
here, you can make out the locations on the periphery of this almost
perfectly square plaza.  Travelers head to and from a gate to the west,
filling the square with merchants and others, passing through the city by
way of the Arien road.  Further east, the square eventually leads to the
eastern portion of the city, while a similar passage cuts through a wall a
ways to the south.  The north wall of the plaza is dominated by a series of
shops and taverns, mainly devoted to providing for the merchants who pass
through here.  The exact center of the plaza houses a sizeable granite
fountain, its circular base surrounding a pool whose water source is a
statue of tall caladaran.  The cobblestone ground of the plaza bears shows
many signs of wear and use, the fountain being a popular gathering place for
merchants newly arrived in the city.  A small, square grate sits at the
eastern side of the base of the fountain.

Frinian Way~
Frinian Way is a broad but winding street which heads generally east and
west through New Earendam.  Scholars, artisans, and other craftsmen use this
street, bringing their goods from the east to the Arien Plaza, where they
can be peddled to the merchants that gather there.  The buildings lining
this street appear of more recent construction than the cobblestones of
Frinian, which show the marks of what could only be nigh on hundreds of
years of wear.  In contrast, the surrounding buildings, while hewn from the
Brintors, show signs of the shapings of magic.  In particular, a small tower
and base lies to the north of here, seemingly formed from the melting of
some liquid black stone.  Home to the enigmatic Brotherhood of the Golden
Flame, the tower seems active, but no entrance is apparent from this side of
the street.

craftsmen use this street, bringing their goods from the east to the Arien
Plaza, where they can be peddled to the merchants that gather there further

while hewn from the Brintors, show signs of the shapings of magic.  In
particular, a small tower and base lies to the northwest of here, seemingly

Brotherhood of the Golden Flame, the tower seems active, but no entrance is

the area known as New Earendam.  The square continues to the north and east
where it opens up in roads which lead away from the square, while a central
fountain is directly northeast.

South of Tyril Square~
The south half of Tyril square serves as one of the main throughfares for
the traffic which comes from the north gate of Earendam.  Covered with a
cobblestone of glazed brown bricks, despite being well-traveled, this part
of the square is very well maintained.  To the north, a statue inset in a
fountain dominates the center of the square, while the corners of the square
lie east and west.  Southward the square narrows to a spur off Tyril Way.

Southeast of Tyril Square~
The southeast corner of Tyril Square is a popular gathering spot for
scholars, nestled as it is between the sides of two of the city\@s most
renowned storehouses of arcana.  Both buildings lie to the south and east,
and both are constructed in the manner of the grand Republican style --
Brintor marble stairs lead up above street level to pass through ornate
columns into the respective stores, both trying their best to dominate their
immediate environs.  The square opens in streets both north and west of
here, while a central fountain lies northwest.  An ornate marble marker with
inscribed writing here lies between the two shops, identifying features of
each.

East of Tyril Square~
The east of Tyril Square is covered with a smooth cobblestone of glazed
brown bricks.  Near the north gate of Earendam, Tyril Square is filled with
the traffic of artisans and scholars who inhabit this part of the city.  The
center of the square is west, where a marble statue rises out of the silver
base of a large fountain.  South and north are the edges of the square,
where scholars have set up shop to ply the wares of some of Avendar\@s most
famous magicks.  To the east Frinian Way heads into the heart of the
artisan\@s quarter, where scholars and craftsman come to learn and ply their
trade.

wealth and its building materials.  The gate is mainly used by Brintorean
miners, traders, or the occasionally diplomatic party from Kor Thrandir.

Center of Tyril Square~
The center of Tyril square is dominated by a marble statue, serving as
the centerpiece for a concentric series of fountains.  Serving as the
junction for travel between Earendam\@s north gate, the mercantile quarter,
the artisan\@s district, and the occasional nobleman from Old Earendam across
the Dantaron, the square is nevertheless well-maintained, and covered with a
glazed brown cobblestone of Brintorean stone.  The main throughfares of the
square are Frinian Way, which intersects the square in the east and picks
up again in the west, and Tyril Way, which opens onto the square to the
south.

appears as a thin man, with a slightly crafty look.  Other, more apocryphal
legends surround Tyril, portraying him as marrying the daughters of a

gate as it heads toward the Uthlin.  Tyril continues further west, following
the walls of the enormous building which dominates the riverside.  Towering
over the north of the street, the building is the Glallian School, known as
a center for the magics of earth.  In keeping with its ancient tradition, it
is built in the classical republican style of Earendam, complete with the
required marble staircase leading up to its arched entrance.  Hewn from the
brown stones of the Brintors, the lack of seams and cracks in the building
almost suggest a building made of one contiguous piece of mountainside.

comes in an end when it meets the Dantaron river to the east.  The building
to the south, however, is what truly dominates the scenery of this part of
the square.  Made of tall towers of silver, connected by gossamer bridges of
diamond, and topped with glimmering white spires, the building is a marvel
of architecture, encompassing all styles and none.  A massive door shaped
in the mouth of a griffin provides entry into the building, which is large
enough to continue further west.

South Tyril Square~
South Tyril Square is renowned for the performers who come here to show
off their talents.  Located near the School of the Silver Griffin,
illusionists and entertainers of all sorts come to this place, a center
famed for its amusements.  The square continues to the north and east, and
opens in Tyril Way to the west.  To the south, however, stands a rather an
unusual building.  Owing allegiance to no particular style, the building is
a colossal series of silver-hewed towers and pillars, defying notions of
common sense concerning weight, stability, or even safety.  Several windows
seem tantalizingly close to street level, but no actual entrance appears
visible.

Tyril Way~
Tyril Way heads east and west through the streets of New Earendam,
traveling through the heart of the artisan\@s district.  The north and south
sides of the street are a study in architectural contrasts.  To the north
is a building built in the classical republican style, with wide arched
pillars and an ascending staircase of marble.  The building to the south,
however, owes no allegiance to any such style, classical or otherwise.  A
colossal series of improbable silver-hewed towers and pillars, the buildings
seems to defy notions of common sense concerning weight, stability, or even
safety.  Several windows seem tantalizingly close to street level, but no
actual entrance appears visible.  To the west, the street turns, while to

Tyril Way, by contrast, heads off to the east, moving into the area of the
city properly known as New Earendam, home in the main to most of the city\@s
artisans and craftsmen.  Both merchants and artisans trickle through the
crossing, heading south towards the merchant houses which line Calvala
Street, and west towards the beginning of Crescent Street, where most of the

Tyril Way~
A street lined with intricately meshed cobblestones and mortar, Tyril Way
heads east and west through the middle of the part of the city known as \#New
Earendam\#.  By and large the traffic along this road are mainly artisans and
scholars, heading to from the residential district further west, or deeper
into New Earendam to the east.  The buildings here are still relatively
utilitarian, but every now and then the occasional Brintor stone edifice
will sport a column or the steep stairs of the classical Republican style. 
One building which is untouched by these stylistic changes is an open air
butcher\@s shop, which proffers its wares to the south.

End of Trinian Way~
Trinian Way comes to an end here, halted by the course of the Dantaron
and the warehouses which line the north part of the street.  The course of
the Dantaron curves here, turning from north-south to head east and west. 
Crossing the Dantaron to the south is an arched stone bridge, rising high
over the surface of the river to accommodate the naval traffic.  The street
heads off to an intersection in the west.

Intersection of Calvala Street and Trinian Way~
This intersection of two streets lies along the main north-south stretch
of Calvala street, and marks the beginning of Trinian way to the east. 
Trinian follows the banks of the Dantaron, and is lined by the warehouses
used to house the goods which pass along the river.  Calvala heads north and
south, moving through the heart of Earendam\@s mercantile quarter, housing
many of the city\@s merchant families.  Notable among these is the Casidian
family, who has their headquarters beyond the marble walls of the large
building which sits aside the intersection on the west side of the street.

Intersection of Calvala and East Jralin Street~
This intersection of two streets lies along the main north-south stretch
of Calvala street, which runs through the heart of Earendam\@s mercantile
district.  The intersection marks the end of East Jralin street, which meets
Calvala street here in this three way throughfare.  Merchant of varying
sizes line the east of Calvala street, and this juncture\@s proximity to both
the Arien Plaza and the merchant houses here make it a popular stopping
point for merchant parties.  The merchant houses that begin on the east side
of the street here line both sides of the way further south, and an even

The common room of the Silver Wolf is a raucous place, filled with a
crowd of drunken kankorans, interspersed with the occasional savage-looking
human.  The room is illuminated only by torchlight, and the wall space and
ceiling are covered with various animal trophies.  Most prominent are a set
of hides and antlers hanging on the south wall, along with a grinning wolf
skull which is in the center of the display.  Further off to the north is
the bar of the tavern, while an open doorway leads east onto an alleyway.  A
massive oak door is set in the west wall, evidently leading to some sort of
private room adjoining the tavern.

and coarse-grained wood, but racks of antlers are arranged on either side of
the bar as a sort of trophy.  The only way to leave the bar area is to head

large and magnificent oak table.  Seated against the west wall is an equally
massive chair, designed for the head of whatever group makes use of the
room.  Other adornments along the walls of the room include a series of much
stained axes and clubs, along with the occasional battlefield trophy.  The
exit from the room lies through an oaken door to the west.

Krutik\@s Weapons~
Krutik\@s Weapons is a dim place, poorly lit by a single lamp.  Built in
what passes for the slums in Earendam, the shop is coated with a layer of
dirt and grime.  Built to take advantage of its surroundings, the shop is
built flush with the wall of the city to the west, and the side of a stone
tenement to the east.  The north of the shop is panelled with pine, and used
as a makeshift display for the wares of the store.  The shop has no door,
and merely exits out towards an alley to the south.

Pine-Panelled Room~
This small room is panelled in pine on all sides, and is barely five feet
on a side.  The center of the room is taken up by a circular pit, into whose
side is set the rungs of an iron ladder.  The only noteworthy feature of the
room is a panel on the southern wall, which appears to be hinged to allow it
to open.

Scero Way~

tenements in varying states of disrepair, except for two notable exceptions.
To the west, a soot-stained brick structure advertises mercenaries for hire.
More impressively, to the east lies a building carved from blocks of solid
obsidian, a lofty study in columns and other such stonework, rising above
the surrounding buildings.

building.  More dramatically, a tall building carved from obsidian blocks
rises to the east, lofty columns looming over every other surrounding
building.  The street continues northward into an area of tenements and flop

intersection is well travelled by merchants heading to and from warehouses
on the Dantaron, heading to and from various shipping companies and the town
gates much further north up Valectus Street.  Pasintian runs east and west,
moving parallel to the Dantaron to the east, and narrowing into an alley to
the west.  At each corner of the intersection is an iron-wrought post,
topped with an oil lanterns, allowing travelers even in the dead of night to

the wood of the buildings near hear is almost uniformly cracked or rotting. 
Plants push up the cobblestones here and there, resulting in a very uneven
street.  Several cobblestones have almost completely been pushed aside by
the plants in several places.  In the center of the cul-de-sac, the cobbles
slope down slightly to a small square drain.

The East Gates of Earendam~
Earendam\@s eastern gates are made of wrought iron, and framed by an
intricate series of carved pillars which mark the gate\@s break in the wall. 
Carrying traffic from along the Uthlin road and the lands further east, it
tends to bear more aristocratic travel, with the Dantaron River handling

the wrought-iron handrail, hanging artfully downwards to provide a pleasing
view from all angles.  The stairs climb to a landing a ways above, and a
door back into the foyer is to the west.

A Landing on a Flower-Laden Staircase~
A spiral staircase comes to a wide landing here, the floor an intricate
pattern of granite tile.  Hanging from the railings below are ropes of peach
blossom and iris; above this level are alternating hydrangeas and camellias
adorning the staircase.  The staircase extends another storey in both
directions, and westward an open archway leads into a room paneled in golden
maple.

Meticulously carved and cared for, the temple is devoid of the gold and
silver ornaments found in temples to other gods, but in the frieze above the
entranceway, the characters of the bas relief are lined with diamond, and
the center depicts the sapphire spear, symbolically represented by an

Inside a Temple to Jolinn~
The interior of Earendam\@s temple to Jolinn is daunting in its size. 
Topped by a dome of bluish marble, the room is illuminated by the glass
oculus that breaks the surface of the roof.  Light reflects on the carved
mosaic in the floor, which depicts the precepts of Jolinn in shades of
sapphire and inlaid mother-of-pearl.  A rival even to Iandir\@s prevalent
religion in this city, Jolinn\@s temple is tended by an ancient group of
clergymen, and maintained by the city\@s wealthier patrons.  To the west, an
altar is set upon an illuminated dais, while alcoves lead north and south

mural goddess calaera~
This large mural is painted in the Harrudim style - the goddess is

Detailed with pointillation of thousands of chips of semiprecious stone, the
six-winged seraph raises one hand, palm facing you, thumb folded
horizontally along the hand.  Her other hand grips a magnificent flaming
sword highlighted with gleaming peridot, tourmaline, jasper, and ruby.  A
few clouds float around and behind her, but other than that, she is the only

The Common Room of the Arien Way~
The common room of the Arien Way is a large square chamber, panelled with
planks of scented pines.  Filled with tables and the smoke of the torches
which illuminate the chamber, this room is a common gathering place for the
merchants who frequent the Arien Plaza.  The room\@s decor seems to be a cut
above the typical tavern, with the occasional painting adorning the walls,
and a simple tile mosaic covering the floor.  The common room continues
north and east, and meets the bar west of here.

jars of preserved meats and other spices, the shop does a brisk enough
business to demand that these supplies be on hand.  A stone building with a
wooden ceiling, the shop is built in the more modern mercantile style which
dominates this party of the city, known colloquially as \#New Earendam.\#

The entrance to the tower of the Brotherhood of the Golden Flame is a
cramped and hot antechamber, illuminated by glowing bowls of pitch.  Gold
engravings glow red in the flickering light, covering the walls and doorway
in a series of eerie patterns.  Otherwise, the room seems to be made of a
blackish stone, which seems to have been melted into place as a solid lump
to form the ceiling and floor.  A small break in the wall leads out of the
tower to the east, and an archway leads into the interior of the tower to

Septivar\@s Potions~
Septivar\@s shop is littered with bits of alchemical detritis, evidence of
the fact that most of the brewing of his potions is done here.  A cauldron
boils in a hearth set in the north wall of the room, and a workbench is
flush with the east wall.  The only exit from the confines of this cramped
room is a doorway to the west, which leads out to an alley.

Ilyath\@s Scrolls~
Ilyath\@s Scrolls is constructed in the classical Republican style of
Earendam, from the domed ceiling to the intricately carved friezes above the
columns which circle the room.  Between each of the pillars is a glass case,
behind which rest the scrolls Illyath has made available.  Exits lead down

Llantavus\@ Wands and Staves~
This rather well-to-do store is run by Llantavus, a noted scholar
specializing in wands and staves.  Designed in the classical Republican
style, the ceiling is domed marble, and the floor is an intricate mosaic of
tiles.  Columns dot the walls of the room, outlining various cases and
stands which display wands and staves.  To the north and south, stairs lead

Undilsa\@s Boats~
A long stone building, Undilsa\@s Boats serves the burgeoning merchant
demand for river craft.  The back of the shop actually opens on the river,
where a series of small rafts and other ships lie moored.  The rest of the
shop is filled with the clutter of a nautical life.  Various charts of river
and ocean currents line the walls, along with the occasional mounted anchor.
A small desk handles the business transactions which occur here.  Other than
the exit onto the river, a doorway leads west back onto the street.

Mercenary Guild~
A sooty and dank place, this building houses the Company of the Serpent,
one of Earendam\@s chartered mercenary companies.  Hand-crafted from clay
bricks, the building is built flush with Earendam\@s west wall.  This room
seems devoid of furnishings, save an ancient desk.  The only illumination in
the room comes from a pitch lantern, which fills the room with a black smoke
while providing only fitful illumination.  The street lies east through an
open doorway, and a small alcove lies to the south.

Despite the dank air which permeates this room, there is still an aura of

pieces of armor are arranged in racks, and the hard clay bricks of the floor
are scuffed by the marks of passing boots.  A wooden door opens west of

South Wall of the Temple of Darkness~
Earendam\@s temple of darkness is an architectural hybrid, blending the
classical Republican forms with the statuery of Yithoul and the intricate
carvings of the Srryn.  The temple is topped by a barrel-vaulted roof, which
leads from the southern entrance towards the central altar set in the far
north wall.  Supporting the ceiling are a series of onyx columns, whose
intricate carvings serve to frame a set of statues in marble, forming a sort
of gallery along the east and west walls.  A pair of flaming braziers are
near the southern doorway, which burn red from the light of the smoking

the THIRD book .... \#Co-terminal Extraplanar Transport in the Prime Material\#
the FOURTH book.... \#The Ch\@taren Problem:: Elimination or Enslavement?\#
~
E
first~
The central thesis of the book concerns a defense of the use of bonded
creatures over inanimate foci, such as those used by spirit scholars.  
 
One prominent passage reads:
 
The Binding doth serve two purposes in the advancement of the Art:
Firstly, it brings power, and in large measure - certainly, it cometh with
the Price, but the Price is only paid foolish enough to let the target of
their magic dies, and thus satisfies the Rule of Iron: Each punished
according to his folly.
 
 
The second purpose is oft overlooked among the uninitiated though.
Not only does the Binding give one increased strength, it also sharpens
the Will, and gives the scholar a more general practice in the bending of
the hearts of the weak-minded. One is compelled to practice the rites
effectively and diligently. How else could we open the ilamorphs channel
to the Void without the invocation of \#Orbulg\#, or use other such verbal
commands?
 
~
E
second~
The introduction reads:
 
A lesser demon within the planes of Void, the Gharku
is said to dwell primarily in the sulfur vallyes of Alguth,
often serving in the entourage of the Named demons who
pass through this region.
 
 
...
 
The female Gharkus are often quite rapacious, requiring gifts
of magically imbued items to satiate their fury. Male Gharkus,
noted for bouts of lust, resist as long as they can before
succumbing to their nature. The most successful paramours 
often hoard magical items, accepting them in payment for terms
of magical contract, and will often viciously attack any wizard on
sight in hopes of acquiring magical lucre.\#
 
 
The book goes on to describe the actual details of Gharku
intimacy in great detail, including a series of illustrations, 
which the book touts as having been drawn by the observations
of over one hundred seperate Gharku summonings.
 
~
E
third~
The book is nominally a study of the creation of intra-planar gates,
but actually lapses into an abstract series of theses regarding a purported 
link between what areas are proper gates and obscure geometrical
properties of the void and its connection to the prime material plane.
 
The long and short of the book seems to be a theoretical prediction that 
the plains of Shargob are inacessible through the use of the gate spell,
and a conjecture that other such areas of high negative magical energy
might also be inaccessible via gate.
 
~
E
fourth~
Penned by the noted shuddeni scholar Jakhravil, the text 
concerns the problem of the ch\@taren.
 
Since the setbacks at the end of the War our people 
brought to the surface world, shuddeni have long debated
the proper policy of dealing with the ch\@taren.
 
Firstly, the two tenets seem to be at odds. For certainly, the
Principle of Hate assures us that the ch\@taren are little more 
than a pox on the body of the shuddeni, and as such should
be burned away. Bringing their decadent spirit magics and
alien and corrupt moral codes to Avendar, they pose a  
continuing threat to our inevitable and predestined mastery
of the world. Seemingly, the principle of Greed would 
contradict this truth - after all, have not the ch\@taren prisoners 
at work in our cities near the crystal sea shown they can be
used, and used admirably? Should we not use any of
the lesser races in such a fashion, most of all the ones 
which so often have stood against us?
 
As those conversant with logic are aware, there are no true
contradictions, only apparent ones. Both the Principles of 
Hatred and Greed may be satisfied. For, is it not possible
to work a ch\@taren to death in a slave mine?  Can we not
impose more restrictions, and not less on them? May not
a promise of better conditions be employed, when as a
point of fact the translucent ones are worked to their deaths? 
And this says nothing of the possibilities of the intelligent
use of the ch\@taren life force once the foul things perish!
 
Herein, I will present the detailed plans for a new policy
toward ch\@taren that will maximize both our own 
opportunities for vengeance as well as their potential 
use as a slave race....\#
 
The text goes on to outline a rather extensive series of plans
for dealing  with the ch\@taren, including elaborate plans to
use the ch\@taren to expand the east wall of Yithoul into a 
series of chaja breeding pits and a new series of arcane
schools.

Circular Chamber~
This circular chamber resembles a well bottom.  The curved walls frame an
earthen floor, and the ceiling lies out of sight far above.  Leading up the
side of the chamber is an iron ladder, which appears fixed into the bricks
of the wall.  The only other exit lies through an oak door, which opens to
the south.

A Four-Way Intersection~
This chamber is a sort of four way intersection, with the room formed by
the intersection of two stone cylinders.  Torches illuminate the room,
hanging near the exits.  Despite the damp air of the underground, the room
floor is dry and covered with a simple tile.  Doors lie in each of the
cardinal directions, leading out of the chamber.

Chamber of Knives~
A low-ceilinged chamber, this small room\@s northern and southern walls
are covered with a series of knives, arranged as if on display.  Ranging
from whisper-thin daggers to jagged main gauches, the weapons are shown in
an instructional fashion, with differing types placed in different
categories.  Near the west wall, a series of humanoid figures are arranged
on poles, with vital regions marked in red ink.  The only exits from the
room lies through a door, which opens to the east.

Entrance to the Krilin Bull~
The Krilin Bull is a loud and busy tavern, filled with dockworkers and
the occasional sailor from Var Bandor.  Most of the inhabitants of the
tavern gather about the bar to the north, while a very few trickle out onto
the alleyway to the south.  The tavern narrows here as it nears the southern
exit, forcing awareness of its cheap pine walls and sawdust floor.

Near the Bar of the Krilin Bull~
The Bar of the Krilin Bull is a simple and much-abused affair,
constructed of simple pine logs arranged in a rectangle against the north
wall.  Filled with dockworkers and other waterfront toughs, the area away
from the bar is scattered with rough wooden tables and chairs.  The
sawdust-covered floors lead toward the entrance to the tavern to the south,
and a corner to the west.

Corner in the Krilin Bull~
This smoke-filled corner is taken up with a large table, of slightly
better quality than the rest of the Krilin Bull\@s furnishings.  The walls of
the tavern appear to be made from a poor cut of pine here, and the liberal
sprinklings of sawdust only serve to cover the rather common smell of the
place.  The only break in the monotony of the simple furnishings is an oil
painting, which hangs on the rear wall and depicts the tavern\@s namesake.

Entrance to the School of the Silver Griffin~
The entrance to the School of the Silver Griffin is opulently furnished,
but with a style that ranges from the merely exotic to the truely grotesque.
The walls are covered with gaudy metallic tapestries, depicting a series of
bucolic scenes, colored in shades of gold and silver.  The floor is simple
marble, but covered in the hides of furred animals.  Illuminating the room
are a set of colored lights, which float near the ceiling of the room. 
Polished to a mirror shine, the roof above you reflects the light, casting
the odd colors obscenely about the room, highlight some areas in vivid
colors, while leaving others shaded.  To the south, an exit from the room
lies through what appears to be a griffin\@s beak, while a recessed door sits
in the eastern wall.  A relatively plain archway opens to the north.

A lush grove of trees grow here, perched atopped a massive ledge which
drops off to the east.  Peering over the edge reveals an almost
inconceivably deep canyon, whose jagged sides lead down to a bottom not
visible from this height.  The trees are primarily pines, with the
occasional massive oak spreading its massive branches to shade the ground
below it.  The most interesting of the trees, though, is a red-leafed maple,
which has a westward-leading door carved into its bark.

Atop the Tower~
The top of this tower is an open court, bounded by a series of irregular
battlements around the edges.  Sporadically placed around the edges of the
tower are busts of griffins, all made from molded silver.  From the vantage
point, South Tyril Square is visible on the ground to the north, and the
course of the Dantaron snakes along the ground to the south.  Within the
complex of the school, another tower is west of here, with a visible balcony
facing the current landing.  In the center of the tower, an oculus in the
ground leads downward.  Swirling out of the hole is a gust of wind, which
looks buoyant enough to hold a person airborne.  Crossing between the two
towers is a bridge of colored lights, made of a swirling cloud of mist and
vapor.

Zanala\@s Chamber~
Zanala\@s chamber serves as the audience room of the head of the school. 
The opulence of the furnishings is tempered only by the sheer exotic nature
of the room\@s contents.  A delicate chandelier dangles from the ceiling, and
is carved completely from quartz.  Various stuffed creatures float, rather
than hang from the wall.  Among the menagerie is both a stuffed srryn head
as well as a dessicated cave slug.  The north wall is all shelving, and is
filled with all manner of arcane and exotic paraphernalia of the magics of
air.  The shelves hold everything from misty-delicate illusions of the races
of Avendar to a small crystal, which shines with a soft blue glow.  The
seating in the room is haphazard at best -- a leather couch floats a few
inches off the ground, while a few chairs remain obstinately bolted to the
floor.  The only exit from the chamber lies through an archway to the east.

Chamber of Shaping~
The chamber of Shaping is designed with a spherical room, and centers
around a circular bowl in the center of the room.  The bowl, designed as a
sort of great pot, holds a smooth chunk of white marble in place, and is
decorated around its rim with mystical symbols.  Ringing the bowl are knee
pads, designed to allow kneeling persons to examine the marble more closely.
The exit from the chamber lies through an oak door to the south.

Anteles\@ Chamber~
Anteles\@ chamber is used as a receiving room for the scholar.  Meticulous
in a manner that is as aesthetic as it is utilitarian, the chamber houses an
impressive assortment of scrolls and ledgers.  His desk occupies the west
portion of the room, and prominently displays an abacus as well as a quill
pen and inkwell.  The chambers end in the north wall, where an oaken door
opens onto a hallway.

Lania\@s Studio~
These chambers serve as the personal studio of the archmage Lania.  The
place is designed primarily for sculpture, with a large work table in the
center of the room.  Sitting on the table is a half-finished statue, still
emerging from a block of marble.  Conspicuously absent are a lack of
scultpor\@s tools and marble dust in the place.  Elsewhere, an oak door leads
north out of the chamber.

Lania\@s Study~
Lania\@s study is used by the archmage both for magical research as well
as a receiving room.  Furnished in the typical Glallian style, a set of
miniature columns holds up the four corners of the room, each carved with
intricate moldings at the top and bottom.  Also present are the canonical
shelves for scrolls and arcane texts, along with a display case set in the
north wall.  In prominent view, the case holds the magical miscellania of an
archmage -- everything from a series of vividly shimmering crystals to an
odd floating clock.  Lania\@s desk is also here, filled with neat stacks
of scrolls and drawings.  The only exit from the chamber lies through an
ornate crystalline door, which lies to the south.

The Dantaron River~
The placid waters of the Dantaron make their way through the city of
Earendam.  Passing between the artisan\@s district to the north, and the old
city to the south, the river is a major throughfare for travel in the city. 
The waters of the Dantaron are deep here, clouded by the dark mud of its
bottom, and the frequent river-traffic along its course.  The river
continues to the east, but takes a bend to the south further west.

Underneath a High Stone Bridge~
The Dantaron flows beneath this high stone bridge, dividing the two
halves of the city of Earendam.  Muddy beaches line both the north and south
banks of the river, perpetually damp from the lack of sunlight.  The placid
waters of the river continue both east and west, passing into the open as it
heads away from the bridge.

This mural portrays the triumphant conclusion to the War of Fire.  Srryn
and human forces scatter across a great battlefield, as gigantic Titans
march across plains, bearing weapons of pure light to strike at the remnants
of the srryn horde.  Victorious aelin and a small band of humans march with
them, healing dead and shattered lands in the wake of the long years of the
war.  Carrying the banner of the Sons and Daughters of Jolinn, those humans
sided with the aelin march to complete victory.  The scenes after the battle
are those of healing and reconstruction.  Featured prominently are the
humans under the banner of Jolinn, who build two mighty towers.  One,
located near the Brintors, is topped with a dome of gold, and is marked in
runes as \#Aramril\# on the mural.  The other tower is built on an isle in the
midst of the Dantaron, and is labelled \#Salyra\#.  Ascending to reign over
Salyra is a strikingly beautiful woman, while two brothers come to reign at
Aramril.  The mural ends with the focus on the tower of Salyra, where the
god Jolinn rises from the river to extend his blessing.

in icy mountains.  Fighting their way across frozen wastes against primitive
wolf-men, they make their way to a cave.  Within, they fight beings of fire,
living in red caves far below the rock.  At the head of the group at each
step are two men and a woman, marked by a resemblance to each other that is
both of blood and of fierce resolution.  The panel on the north wall shows
the object of their long journey.  Entombed in a flame shrouded bier is
Jolinn, who sleeps beneath the icy north.  The humans kneel before the god,
wrapped in religious ecstasy as the god awakens.  The next shows the god
with the humans, followed by armies of Titans, giant beings wielding weapons
of pure light.

separates the front and back halves of the store, a few cigars set out on it
as a display, and a small object, magically enchanted to produce a small

Scrying Pool of Salyra~
This chamber is shaped as a nearly perfect circle, with a series of
concentric steps leading down to a massive marble basin.  Filling the
gigantic bowl is a pool of water, its flawlessly smooth surface mirror-like
in the room\@s light.  Carved on the sides of the basin is a flowing pattern
of runes, with the cardinal directions marked by particularly large and
elaborate glyphs.  The only light in the room comes from a small slit of a
window, which crosses the west wall.  The resulting muted light is angled to
reflect off the water, giving it its mirrored surface.  The only exit from
the chamber lies through an oak door, which opens to the east.

Lydara\@s Chambers~
These chambers are the receiving room of the archmage Lydara.  While the
rank of the owner of these rooms is obvious from the lavish use of space and
glass in the windows, it is nevertheless furnished in a sparse manner.  The
only settings in the room are Lydara\@s desk, and a slim scrollcase behind
it.  An oak door leads out of the chamber to the south.

Chapel of Jolinn~
This small chapel is devoted to the god Jolinn.  Tall, fluted columns
line the north and south of the chapel, forming a boundary between the
worship area and the stone walls of the tower.  The floor is tiled in a
geometric series of blues and whites, marking traditional symbols of the
chapel\@s patron god.  On the east side of the room is the chapel\@s altar,
which is a block of bluish marble set between two basins of crystal clear
water.  Light comes from an oculus high above, illuminating the altar area. 
An oak door leads out of the chamber to the west.

Corner of the Battlements of Salyra~
This rounded corner serves as a guard station atop the Tower of Salyra. 
Made from blocks carved from the sides of the Brintors, the battlements on
this portion of the tower are functional, rather than ornamental.  Easily
capable of protecting two men standing abreast, the ancient turrets are
still strong.  From the northwest corner of the tower, the mercantile
district of Earendam stretches off, a hodgepodge of stone buildings and

Atop the Battlements of Salyra~
The battlements of the Tower of Salyra are made of blocks carved from the
sides of the Brintors.  Sturdy despite the tower\@s obvious age, the
battlements are still quite functional, with blocks easily wide enough to
provide shelter for two men standing abreast.  This particular portion of
the battlements heads east and west, bounded on either side by the inner and
outer walls of the tower.  To the south is the inner wall of the tower,
which blocks the way to a glass oculus, through which the interior of the
tower is visible.  Below the glass, ivy and other hanging plants grow
downward, dangling out of sight.  To the north is the outside wall, which
looks over the Dantaron and a bridge leading into the new city.  A long road
leads north into the mercantile quarter, and merchant houses predominate the
buildings in this part of the city.

discards most elaborate vaulting common in the area, and has a plain,
decorative edging where it meets the walls.  Each corner of the room holds a

is the door out onto Valvaria Street.

This building houses a complete forge, and is filled with sweltering

clearly designed for work on multiple projects at once.  Beds of red-hot
coals are also here and there, each standing next to barrels of water and
clamps.  Soot stains darken the stone ceiling, and racks on the walls hold a
wide assortment of items produced here.  Other than several narrow chimneys
near the back, the only exit lies through an open doorway out onto Arien
Plaza.

This marble-sheathed entrance hall is generously appointed in the
classical styles, with intricate molding in the Republican styles decorating
the pillars that gracefully support the high-vaulted ceiling.  Rich,
burgundy carpeting covers the floor, though the marks of many feet have left
signs of their passage over time.  Paintings and statuery line the sides of
the hall, the assorted objets d\@art tastefully kept away from the hands of
the public with simple velvet ropes.  The majority of the building remains
clear of the public, but people stride in not infrequently from the street,
seeking audience with the master of this house, the candidate Moreth Edeno,
whose personal study lies further to the east.

A Well-Kept Study~
Mahogany paneling and thickly piled Harrudim carpet create a feeling of
warmth in this room, despite both the height of the vaulted ceiling and
large amount of floor space.  Shaded globes of light provide a steady,
gentle illumination to the room, easy enough to read by.  Solidly built
bookshelves line the northern wall, most packed end to end with well-kept
books, a few knick-knacks occupying the rare empty spaces.  A large desk
occupies a corner near the shelves, a well-used chair left sitting half-out.
A halberd sits hung above the fireplace, which is kept burning steadily in
the wintertime, and left empty in the warmer months.  Two large, comfortable
couches face each other across a coffee table, allowing an easy means to
receive the many guests that stream into and out of this room.

This arched stone bridge overlooks the course of the Dantaron river. 
Passing far below, the river carries the trade to and from Var Bandor in the
west, and the sea trade from the Uthlin, which lies east of the city. 
Carved from blocks of polished marble, the bridge is worn from years of
countless travel.  North of the bridge is \#New Earendam\#, the part of the
city rebuilt after the wars with kankoran barbarians in the past few
centuries.  Southward is the old city, covered in buildings built in the
style of the Republic.  Built wide enough to handle three carriages abreast,
the bridge is a major throughfare for traffic of all sorts between the two
halves of the city.

Cartographer\@s Shop~
While a sign on the door identifies this shop as a cartographer\@s, the
cacophony of items in this room relegates the actual maps to a very minor
role.  The north wall is covered with an assortment of weapons, most of them
rusty and unusable from age.  Southward, a collection of monster skulls and

the room are various free-standing displays, such as saddles mounted on
blocks, a wooden model of a sailing ship, and a pole supporting a set of
plate armor.  In the west of the room is a large display case, which
features the maps and other such scrolls visible under a rare pane of glass.

room below.  Illuminating the room are shimmering balls of light, which
float in a circle around the bottom edge of the dome.  Slowly waning and
waxing in intensity, the globes form a shifting mosaic of lights and darks
across the floor of the room.  Cushions are arranged in circles on the
floor, each positioned in a pool of light.  A round door leaves to the west,
and a small hole in the floor leads to a downward stairwell.

An opulently furnished entranceway, this room is the foyer of the Company
of the Zephyr, a chartered company of gentleman adventurers.  The style of
the decor is a curious mixture of the lofty classical forms, and the

The walls and architecture of this establishment are typical of

Exotic flora fills the chamber, growing from pots or troughs, and even
creeping up the walls.  Vividly colored flowers bloom from delicate pots,
and clinging vines border the walls of the room.  The air is preternaturally
warm, and is filled with smells of damp humus.  A covered archway leads

Antechamber~
Well-lit and meticulously constructed, this antechamber serves as the
welcome area for the Watcher\@s Enclave.  Stone pillars are set in the four
corners of the room, supporting the white marble of the ceiling.  Near the
base of each pillar is a carved rune, and the floor is tiled in an intricate
mosaic of a compass rose.  Looming from the west wall is a statue of Iandir,
bearing his crown and gazing over the room.  Archways exit the enclave to
the north and south, and a smaller doorway leads east.  

A large board stands near the entrance, listing the bounties placed on

Observation Deck~
This observation deck is an open air landing, which marks the top of the
Watcher\@s Enclave.  A square area about fifteen paces on a side, it is
walled on each side by a carved marble battlement.  Towards the north rises
the golden-domed palace of the Patrician, the largest structure in Earendam.
To the west, Dantaron avenue heads along the river that is its namesake, and
the Tower of Salyra stands on a small island in the course of the river. 
Eastward lies more of the old city, with the headquarters of the Patrician\@s
Guard nearby, and more noble houses visible beyond that.  Southward,
Republican Avenue turns into Corvandil Square, whose southern expanse leads
to the gates of the city and the grasslands beyond.  An opening in the
center of the landing leads to a set of spiral stairs, which lead downward
and out of sight.

only serve to exacerbate this effect.  The only seating is an oak desk in

Chambers of Memarus~
Memarus\@ chambers serve as both a training room and his personal offices.
Almost perfectly representative of the classical Republican style, the
room\@s walls are made of huge marble bricks, and the ceiling rises in a
small dome-like structure.  Covering the floor is a mosaic of colored glass,
forming a picture of swordsmen at war.  The northern half of the room is
cleared of furnishings, and a small series of red tiles mark its boundary
from the rest of the room.  Plush chairs and a small writing desk provide
the southern half on the room with its function, and a small bookshelf runs
along the west wall.  The only exit from the room is to the east, where a
stone door opens onto a hallway.

along the north and south walls, each tinted with a yellowish impurity that
gives them a golden hue.  Above them is a frieze carved in hammered gold,
depicting historical scenes, with emphasis given to great battles.  The
floor is a mosaic of amber and golden tiles, which swirl about in an
intricate circular fashion.  Marble pews are arranged in a series of aisles,
which run parallel to the columns.  To the east is a raised dais, on which
rests an altar carved from what appears to be a block of huge gold.  The
only exit is the west, where an archway leads out of the chapel.

flourishes and grandeur of the classical Republican style.  Simple stone
blocks form the walls and floor of this square room, and a flat wooden
ceiling is built overhead.  Open doorways lead north and south out of the

The Ruins of the Temple of Enaerai~
This chamber was once a temple to Enaerai, a goddess worshipped by the
knights who bear her name.  The sides of the place once formed a triangle;
the marble walls have been brought down, and heaps of rubble now stand as a
testament to the destruction of the temple.  An intricately carved statue of
Enaerai stands on a dais in the rubble.  The statue is battered and chipped,
having suffered much abuse recently, and closer inspection shows that the
face has been utterly obliterated.  A door leading to the north is
completely filled with rubble.

statue~
A statue of an armor-clad woman is here, her left arm raised at a
ninety-degree angle from her body.  In her extended hand, she holds a set of
golden scales, which shimmer at any breeze in the room, swaying gently. 
Each fingernail is inlaid with a formed ruby that glints dimly in the light
of the room.  She is depicted as a human, and her pale complexion has been
formed of ivory.  Atop her head sits a helm with two massive horns
protruding from it.  The helm itself has been formed of brilliantly-gleaming
platinum, while the horn on the right is made of flawless white marble and
the horn on the left seems to draw light into its deep onyx form.  Wind
seems to dramatically whip at the smooth hematite curves of her skirt,
giving her an overall dramatic appearance.  Over her dress, her thick
obsidian and platinum breastplate shines like a mirror, reflecting back the
light from the sconces about the room.  At the base of the statue is a small
engraving.

on which to sit.  A faint, barely-audible sound of music lingers on the edge
of hearing, granting the room a serene air.  Eastwards, the wall opens in an
arch onto the granite landing.

The Room of the Scale~
This simple stone side-room opens to the Assembly Hall to the west.  A
trim wooden door is set the eastern wall.  Made from immense granite bricks,
the walls of the hall are sanded to a smooth grain, and the floors are kept
clean of dust and dirt.  In the center of the room, a massive granite
tri-stone rises up from the floor, forming an altar upon which an intricate
golden scale rests.  The scale reflects the light from rows of thick white
candles set in niches along the walls.

scales~
The golden scale is none other than the mystical of Scale of Orlin, said
to have been given the first Knight High Lord by Enaerai herself.  It is an
intricate work of several linked balance-pans, bars, and counterweights,
some of which slowly rotate in a semi-orderly fashion.  Those who have true
dedication to the philosophies of balance consult it to understand how the
balance lies throughout Avendar.

A Small Antechamber~
The most noticeable features of this small antechamber are the stone
doors to the north, east, and south.  Above each of the doors is a rune,
chiseled in stone.  High along the walls, rows of thick white candles set
into wall-niches shed a pale warm light.  To the west, a trim wooden door is
set in the wall.

A sheet of parchment is tacked to the wall, below a row of candles.

An Elaborate Study~
Polished mahogany paneling covers the walls of this high-ceilinged
chamber, with stylized molding in the Republican style, connecting the
panels to the vaulted roof.  Illuminated by the flickering light cast from
sparingly placed candelabras, the room is suffused with a dusky, subdued
atmosphere.  On the far end of the chamber, a heavy-set desk of polished
burgundy is set, facing the doorway.  A high-backed chair of matching
burgundy rests behind the desk.  Solidly built bookshelves line the northern
wall, each one packed end to end with a variety of dusty books and tomes. 
On the eastern edge, a large oaken bureau lies flush with the wall, its
layered base lying at the edge of a thick rug.  To the south, a strikingly

The Dining Room~
A long, arched chamber of hewn granite stretches northwards, braced
against supports of sanded pine.  Along the length-wise walls, intricately
woven tapestries of brightly colord silks have been hung from the rafters. 
Placed at the head of the chamber is a large oil painting, framed in a
stylized set of golden laurels.  Resting atop an expansive rug, a dining
table of rich burgundy stretches across the chamber, covered with sets of
fine porcelain, crystalline decanters, and glistening silverware.  Along
each side of the table are a dozen matching chairs of polished burgundy,
their seats plushly upholstered in a soft, dark leather.  Above, an ornate
crystal chandelier fills the room with its flickering, refracted light.  A
strikingly simple stone doorway leads to the east.

craftsmanship.

The Master Bedroom~
As wide as it is tall, the master bedroom is a masterpiece of tasteful
ostentation.  Dominating the southwestern corner is a richly carved bed of
dusky mahogany, covered in a silken canopy.  At the head of each bedpost are
images of winged angels, bearing the sleeper\@s dreams into the heavens.  The
bed itself is covered by a stack of heavy blankets and an assortment of
variously shaped goose-down pillows.  At the foot of the bed lies a
hide-bound footlocker, strapped shut with a thick leather band.  An ornate,
golden candelabra rests by the bedside, gleaming in the light provided by
its scented wax candles.  Opposite the bed, a burning hearth has been set
into the hewn granite walls.  Atop the mantel rest various pieces of colored
glass, as well as a small marble bust set into the wall.  A heavy oaken
door, set in a strikingly simple doorway, leads to the north.

A High Vaulted Chamber~
A large circular chamber, some fifty feet across, rises to a high vaulted
ceiling far above.  The chamber is girdled by a wide spiral staircase, which
meets the floor on the eastern side of the room, where it fans outward to
face the chamber\@s center.  The staircase leads to a semi-circular landing,
which curves across the western half of the chamber before continuing its
rise. Great pillars of white marble, inset into the walls, support the
staircase on ever-rising arches, and rise beyond the staircase to found the
high marble arches of the ceiling itself.

Around the walls, and hanging from the edges of the stairway grow a great 
number of potted plants, all lush and tropical. A large fountain in the 
center of the room fills the chamber with the trill murmur of falling water. 
The chamber is flooded with light spilling in from windows high above. 
Archways lead from the chamber to the north, south, east and west. All but 
the south are set with bronze-bound mahogony doors.

A Marble Antechamber~
A vaulted ceiling of green-veined marble roofs this octagonal
antechamber, atop pillars of similar marble which are set into the walls at
each vertex.  The four cardinal walls are wider than the diagonal walls.  To
south an archway leads into a hallway, while the western wall is set with
solid, oak double doors.  In the center of the room stands a large desk of
richly grained rosewood, which faces the northern arch.  In one of the
corners of the desk stands a small, brass-faced sign.

A Wide Landing~
A wide landing forms a semi-circle around the western half of this high
circular chamber.  It joins a spiral staircase on the northern side which
curves down to the floor, some thirty feet below, and on the southern side
where the stairs rise to a smaller, outward-jutting platform near the
vaulted ceiling high above.  Great white marble pillars, inset into the
walls, rise from the floor to support both staircase and landing, and rise
yet higher to found the intersecting marble arches of the vault.  Between
the pillars, just below the uppermost arches, are set huge windows, which
flood the chamber with white light.  

As well as the staircase, which leads up and down, two archways lead from
the landing, to the north and south.

The Great Hall~
A row of magnificent flying buttresses support the high roof in this
great hall.  Like a vast series of ribs, these ornate arches project from a
series of pillars set into the smooth, granite walls.  The ceiling itself,
decorated with extensive moldings, is hung with six enormous iron
chandeliers, in two rows of three, whose hundreds of candles wash the hall
with warm, yellow light.  Adorning the high walls are many tapestries,
exotic animal skins and finely crafted weapons.  In one corner is a small
display stand.  

This westerly half of the hall is warmed by two great open hearths, set into
the north and south walls.  The floor here is clear of furniture, beside a
few leather divans to the sides of the fireplaces.  Upon a raised platform
in the southwestern corner a small group of musicians play fine, soft music.
The hall continues to the east, while to the west a set of bronze-bound
mahogany double doors leads out.

corner small display stand~
Standing in one corner of the great room, this elegant stand is formed of
a dark stone, marbled with streaks of white.  The stand itself is empty, but
a brass placard notes in a flowing script:

Here rests the remnants of legendary Blade of Iniun, broken in a
long-since-forgotten battle centuries ago.  The intricate detail of the
bladework suggests that this piece was crafted by the famed Ghertin of
Avirle himself, though there is no actual record of such.  The blade is
rumored to have emitted a faint hum when it was whole, but if so, no trace
of such a sound remains in the shards.

Beneath the placard has been written, somewhat less elegantly on folded
parchment: With the recent threat of the so-called Scourge, and at the Order
of the Patrician, the pieces of the Blade of Iniun have been relocated to
safer locales.  If you wish to view it, you will need to inquire with the
Patrician himself, for part has been moved to his vault, or with the Port
Town of Gaald, which considerately offered to protect one of the larger
shards, or with the Tower of Aramril, which now keeps charge of the
remainder.  We apologize for the inconvenience.

A Marble Hallway~
A hallway leads northward from a great, light-bathed chamber, visible
through the wide arch to the south.  The length of the corridor is framed by
a series of smooth pillars supporting rib vaults.  Both vault and pillar are
carved from green-veined marble, and marble also are the high walls into
which the pillars are set, and the mirror-like floor which forms a perfect
reflection of this magnificent hall.  The florid architraves and orniture
are carved in alabaster and jade, and seem to shine in transluscent
splendour.  Two archways, set with bronze-bound mahogany doors, face each
other between sets of pillars to the left and right.

The Baths~
Three pools of water are set into the marble floor at the northern end of
this large, square chamber.  Each wide enough to hold several people, the
three pools form a triangle, with two parallel to the northern wall and one
close to the room\@s center.  A larger, rectangular pool of crystal clear
cold water occupies the southern half of the room.  Fluted marble columns
support the mosaiced roof, and archways lead from the east and west walls.

The Earendam Gallery~
This square chamber rises some forty feet to a high domed ceiling above. 
The dome is supported by wide arches, which in turn are supported by
unadorned pillars in each of the four corners.  The dome, arches and pillars
are of a dark, veined marble, but the walls themselves are of smooth, white
stone.  The chamber is bathed in a natural light, although its source seems
far from natural - a great chandelier high above flickers with magical
were-lights.  

The white walls of this gallery are lined with many works of art, done in a
wide variety of media.  A few armchairs, set near the center of the room,
allow for more comfortable viewing.  A tightly-wound spiral staircase of
wood and iron leads to a balcony some twenty feet overhead, where yet more
paintings are displayed.  Open archways lead through the east and west
walls, and a set of bronze-bound mahogany double doors stand closed to the
south.  Next to the doors stands a low, marble pedestal, atop which is a
leather-bound tome.

             \#The Dance of the Naiad\#, by Elfeal Qilheni
              - Oreinn period, water colour on canvas

One of the early works of renowned ethron artist Elfeal Qilheni, \#The
Dance of the Naiad\# is an excellent example of the Oreinn style of painting.
Here we see the well-known hallmarks of this style: strong sensual
overtones, and a freedom, even a frivolity of imagination in choice of
subject matter.  The freedom of the subject matter is paralleled by a
freedom of style.  None of the rigours of the earlier Hisilan or modern
Tierild appear here.  The artist uses her water colours to capture an
intuitive impression, rather than a precise, detailed representation. 
Perhaps the true mastery of this piece is in the motive exuberance with
which the element of water has been captured; both in the graceful, fluid
frolicking of the naiad, and the accompanying dance of the ripples and
reflected forest.  
___________________________________________________________________________
~
E
oreinn~
A vibrant wash of vivid blues and greens, this painting immerses the 
viewer in a tranquil, watery world. Depicted is a young female figure, 
her bare skin in shimmering aquamarine hues, smiling coyly up from the
crystal-clear pond where she swims. Although motionless, the artist has 
managed to capture the illusion of movement. The naiad\@s lithe form is 
set in a dynamic pose; she seems almost to writhe through the water, 
her figure slicing the glassy surface into a complex pattern of ripples. 
Although the forest surrounding the pond is not expicitly depicted, its 
warped reflection frames the naiad\@s figure, and seems nearly as mobile 
as the water spirit herself. 


A wooden plaque hangs next to this painting.

              \#Ysthael ceremonial robe\#, artist unknown
       - Srryn Suiah period, natural dyes on alligator hide

An exquisite example of the Srryn Suiah period, this ceremonial
alligator-hide robe was first worn by Vassethellin, founder of the Ysthael
Sept of fire templars.  It was used by successive leaders of that Sept
primarily during rituals of initiation.  The robe came into the hands of the
Gallery in Saithekan\@s time, during the upheaval surrounding his deposition.

It is an example of Suiah art at its prime, just preceding the War of Fire. 
The crudeness of this piece is belied by the startling composition, in which
the work viewed as a whole seems to hold more information than the sum of
its parts.  A few other Suiah pieces display similar quality of composition,
although such mastery is typically the exception, not the rule.  
___________________________________________________________________________
~
E
suiah~
A heavy robe of alligator skin hangs stretched across the wall here,
sturdy brass clips holding it unfurled. The hide is a landscape of 
scales of varying shapes and sizes; shifting from a jagged ridge 
of spiny scales running vertically down the center to broad plains 
of smooth, shimmering plates toward the edges. The original colour of 
the hide is unclear, as every scale has been brightly dyed to create 
a complex mosaic. 

The mosaic speaks of violence and battle, with two sides - one srryn, 
one human - in pitched combat. The humans are portrayed as diminutive 
beings, armour-clad and wielding steel, yet clearly dominated by the 
dragon-like srryn. The scaled behemoths rend the humans with razor claws 
and engulf them in arcs of magical flame. The ridge of scales in the 
center of the piece has been dyed in violent reds and oranges to 
depict a spiraling inferno. The largest of the srryn figures seems to 
revel at the heart of this conflagration, sending cords of flame across 
the battlefield.

A surprising level of detail has been rendered in this crude format. 
Individual figures are difficult to resolve when studied separately; 
each being the composition of only a dozen or so dyed scales. However, 
viewed as a whole, the piece gains cohesion, and the role of each 
combatant in the vignette is made clear, be they a trampled human 
soldier or a triumphant srryn fire templar.

A plaque of ivory is inset into the wall beside the alligator skin.

A row of magnificent flying buttresses support the high roof in this
great hall.  Like a vast series of ribs, these ornate arches project from a
series of pillars set into the smooth, granite walls.  The ceiling itself,

with warm, yellow light.  Adorning the high walls are many tapestries,
exotic animal skins and finely crafted weapons.  

This easterly half of the hall is dominated by a long table of fine, dark 
wood, surrounded by two dozen high-backed chairs. A couple of smaller 
tables stand closer to the center of the room. Three open hearths are set 
in the north, south and east walls. A small archway in the northeast corner 
is set with swinging doors, while a similar archway in the southeast corner 
is set with closed, bronze-bound doors. To the west, the great hall 
continues.

This hallway is carved from pale marble, marked with sparse veins of

The Earendam Gallery~
A wide balcony girdles the white walls of this high, square chamber,
pierced at each of the corners by thick pillars of dark marble, which rise
from the floor twenty feet below, to found the arches and the dome of the
ceiling, an equal distance above.  An intricate iron chandelier hangs from
the center of the dome, several feet above eye level from the balcony. 
Dancing were-lights, clearly magical, play upon the chandelier\@s frame,
filling the chamber with a natural-seeming light.  

The walls here are lined with many paintings, exhibiting a huge variety of
styles, both modern and historical.  All, however, are of superb quality.  A
narrow staircase of wood and iron spirals down from the balcony at one
point, and a set of mahogany doors, bound in bronze, lead through the
western wall.

A portrait of an aelin lady hangs in this gilded frame, initially
unremarkable, save for its obvious technical mastery and its superb
composition of form.  The lady is beautiful, this much is also immediately
clear, and it is this beauty which holds your eye a moment longer; long
enough to be ensnared by the true genius of the piece.  

The woman\@s face seems to demand examination.  At first it appears young. 
Her features are pale and noble, framed by thick coils of raven-black hair. 
Upon inspection, however, lines of wisdom, grace and strength are revealed. 
She holds an expression of astute appraisal, and it is this expression which
draws your gaze toward her almond eyes.  An instant\@s hesitation allows you
to realise that you had avoided meeting those eyes until now.  However the
subtlety of the artist is great, and you find yourself immersed in their
emerald depths before prudence can dictate otherwise.  

Her eyes are like the sea.  Green and nurturing at first they seem, as the
ocean of the Sapphire Spear, yet the potential for tempestuous fury is also
there - a perilous glint which plays about the pupils.  An untameable
quality hides in their dark depths, which are cold and hidden, and somehow
otherworldly.  Vertigo seizes you as you gaze at them, and you feel as though
you hover above the ocean indeed.  As some stray gull on a wayward wind, or
as a dreamer lost in imagined flight you drift there, precarious, until with
a sudden rush and a heart-lurching plummet the real world swims back to meet
you.  You catch a last glimpse in your descent, a peripheral impression of
some trapped emotion -- that of fear -- the fear of someone imprisoned and
alone.  But the image fades, and you stare once more at an aelin lady,
framed in gold.

As your stare intently into the painting, the shapes begin to form solid
figures...


A pallid Shuddeni stands triumphantly over a translucent figure of quite
small proportion in comparison to him.  An expression of sheer amusement and
fulfillment is about his face despite the blood and flesh that drip in
running streams down the Ch\@taren\@s head.  Jagged shackles are piercing his
victim at various points around the temple and about the back of the head. 

The Shuddeni has a firm grasp on a chain attached to the headgear of his
prey, and he has taken all slack out of it, providing no relief from the
pain.

and yellow are individually engulfed by a larger black counterpart.  In the

With his knees planted firmly into a rigid, straw mat, a young boy
appears to be in absolute relaxation--at one with himself.  His hands are
comfortably resting together, and his eyes are tilted upward toward the
cloudless heavens above him.  

The entire room--from floor to the ceiling posts seem to be crafted from a
complete onyx stone--as if placed in its exact form, and never changed.  

With a hand extended onto the boys smooth forehead, a shimmering white aelin
angel smiles magnificently at the unknowing youth.  Where the angel\@s hand
meets the boy\@s forehead there is a brilliant glare of blue and white.  

A plaque hangs just beneath this painting.

A painting with its colors unscathed by time is framed in a luxurious
wood and glass display.  Behind the focus points of the painting stand two
nebulous gateways of a spectacular white grandeur, each very slightly ajar. 

Two beings with identical angelic wings hover in the midst of several white
clouds. With a beauty rarely seen in actual life, the female has attached
her gaze to the waiting eyes of her male counterpart.  A beatific smile
curls his lips in an upward slant, yet he stares far past the female.  

A plaque hangs from the wall next to this painting.

                The Blessing of Light, artist unknown
                  - oil on canvas, Celestial period

This example of the Celestial period of painting shows the typical
impressionist qualities of that style.  The boy\@s face is defined not by
strict, precise lines as in the Hisilan or Slirucasro periods, but rather by
arrangements of hazy light and shadow.  Vibrant colors and ample use of
texture bring the figures and setting to life, and seem almost as much a
celebration of the medium (here oil on canvas) as of the scene itself.  The
presence of a Ch\@taren as a divine figure in this work marks the artist as
human. Following the War of Night, many humans saw the new-come Ch\@taren as
godly saviours, and depicted them as such in paintings influences by the
Ch\@tarens\@ own style.  Ch\@taren artists of this period tended to restrict
their divine works to depictions of Rystaia, often presiding over groups of
ch\@taren.

            \#The Solution\#, by Yyakhuthos of Yithoul
      - Ashi Uzitha period, alchemically-induced pigment on onyx

An unusual piece, this work is one of the last known examples of the Ashi
Uzitha period.  Its abstraction is typical of shuddeni art from before the
War of Night, in which the true imagery of the piece was often only apparent
to the peculiar vision of shuddeni.  This particular work was painted after
the War, as is apparent from the ch\@taren victim.  By this stage most
shuddeni works were of the Krag Uzitha school, and influenced by the realism
of the aelin Hisilan style.  

This work was painted in Earendam by artist and priest Yyakhuthos of
Yithoul, shortly before his death.  The Champions of Avendar had held the
piece for centuries after artist\@s death, naturally unaware of its nature or
worth. The Gallery thanks the Tower of Aramril for access to its archive,
and its subsequent donation of the masterpiece.

                 Eina Daidil, Aerelin Madrisu
                 - Oil on board, Pious period

Eina Daidil, or \@Ascendant Journey\@ was painted by Aerelin Madrisu 
at the peak of his popularity, and has been hailed by many scholars 
as the pinnacle of this master\@s developement of symbolism. Madrisu 
is held as one of the leaders in the Aelin Pious movement. Distinct 
from Early Pious works, the Pious period saw a dramatic increase in 
detail as well as the introduction of abstract symbolism. In the case 
of \#Eina Daidil\#, we see two godlike aelin figures. The male figure is 
thought to represent the god Serachel, and the female  to represent 
the aelin people in general. The female is enraptured with the male, 
and seems willing to follow him anywhere. The male has his eyes set on 
the far distance. The common interpretation is that Madrisu sought to 
represent Serachel as \#looking beyond\# the current state of the aelin 
people, to a more glorious future. This was, afterall, the popular 
attitude toward the god at this time. Some scholars contend that 
Madrisu, instead of echoing the sentiment of his people at the time,

A Narrow Hallway~
This hallway is narrower and lower than most in the palace, with the pale
marble pillars fanning out into ceiling arches a few feet above your head. 
The reflective marble of the walls is unadorned here, although a long
carpet, black with swirling red patterns, extends the length of the passage.
The hallway leads on to the east.  In the southern wall, close to the
western end, is set a door of ebony, bound with hinges of brazen red bronze.

A Smoke Filled Parlor~
This large, square parlor, panelled in walnut and teak, is filled with
the vibrant murmur of conversation and the heady haze of fragrant smoke. 
Four sets of curving leather divans form circles about small coffee tables. 
A few ornate, rosewood bookshelves line the walls, interspersed with single
leather armchairs.  Also of richly grained rosewood is the small bar which
occupies the northeastern corner of the room.  An archway in the western
wall is set with bronze-bound mahogany double doors.

A Sculpture Gallery~
This elliptical chamber, its major axis running east-west, seems to
accentuate the classical tones of the mansion, with a beautiful tiled mosaic
covering most of the floor and fluted columns of white marble girdling the
curving walls.  Between every pair of pillars a sculpture is displayed, from
a wide variety of styles.  Dominating the chamber, at the foci of the
ellipse, are two magnificent sculptures of pale marble.  Another
particularly elegant sculpture catches the eye from the eastern apex of the
room.  

An open archway is set between two pillars in the western wall.

isaldesc~
The statue before you is a richly sculpted full body portrait of a
caladaran woman.  The sculpture itself is created of a myriad of colours of
stones, rocks, and shimmering gems.  On her thin frame is fitted a stylish
black dress, crafted of the finest, most polished ebony.  It flows about her
form, lapping backward at her feet as some invisible wind appears to hold it
in place.  In her hands, she thrusts a staff forth commandingly, its ends
tipped with quartz crystals that shine like jagged flecks of ice.  Upon her
right shoulder is branded a shimmering golden mark of the Eye of Enaerai. 
Her generally attractive face is set in an expression of determination.  Two
eyes made of shining copper peer out beneath a strong brow, and her thin yet
rouged lips are pursed into a line.  On her head, she wears a marble
approximation of the Dragon Crown, formed with utmost care to become a
nearly exact likeness of the item.  

Standing protectively behind the woman is a great elemental of stone.  It
appears identical to any earth elemental seen with a scholar as it stands,
frozen in time, with its arms extended in a half-circle around her torso. 
Hovering exactly three feet above her extended staff is a pair of rocks
which appear to be small meteors.  Wisps of binding magic occaisionally
flash between the two meteors and the edge of the sculpture\@s staff, yet
otherwise the pair float seamlessly, spinning in the air to give the
illusion of forward motion.

Isal Achia, also sometimes known as the \#Chisel of Enaerai,\# was the leader
of the Knights of Enaerai during the time in which she sculpted this piece. 
Reknowned throughout the land as a great mistress of sculpture, she often
used her artwork as a form of travelling propaganda for the Knights of

This work was created by her at age forty-five, at the peak of her artistic

    \#Eolaapese Rurlil\#  (\#The Dream of Reality\#), by Phusreu Dvilliyo
               - Aelin Ir period, azure marble and iron

Aptly named \#Eolaapese Rurlil\#, or the Dream of Reality, this sculpture is
the work Phusreu Dvilliyo.  Dvilliyo was perhaps the most famous of the
aelin Ir sculptors, and much is still known about his life and works, with
extensive writings surviving the thousands of years since his demise.  This
statue is the prize of the Earendam collection, donated by Ilodaiya as a
sign of goodwill and shared culture.  

This piece is particularly extravagant, even for the Ir period.  The fact
that the figure in the piece is a woman instead of a man, as was
traditional, is a symbol of the dreamlike message.  The aelin seems ready to
take to the sky, both in body and in spirit, on the verge of attaining an
ultimate freedom.  Her robes, touching the ground, are symbols of the
material world, which binds the aelin with its physical needs and social
responsibilities.  The anklet, however, suggests that this binding is
voluntary.  The anklet is fashioned out of a runil, a tool of office of the
judges in Aelin society, a symbol of the rules of the aelin life.  The
suggestion is that the aelin could remove her binding if she so chose, but
does not.  Eolaapese Rurlil is truly a symbol of the Aelin condition, with
the possiblities of freedom, but the acknowledgement of reponsibility and
the love of order, though it constrains them at times.

statuetwo~
The marble statue before you seems to almost move, such is the profusion
of windblown drapery covering the central figure.  An aelin woman stretches
for the sky, cloaked in billowing robes.  The woman\@s body itself is not
touching the base of the piece, except for a light brush with her left foot,
which appears to be about to lift from the base altogether.  Instead the
carved woman is held up by the folds and billows of her robe, as they trail
behind her, more earthbound than her figure itself.  Her left ankle is
encircled by what appears to be an anklet fashioned out of a runil.  The
entire statue has the faint bluish hue of the marble the aelin\@s tend to use
in sculpting, and is exquistitely carved, with the edges sharp enough to
show that the statue has been preserved through time by magic.  

A brass plaque is set into the pedestal beneath the sculpture.

         \#Aelin Enpu\# (\#The Order of Aelin\#), by Dostyn Aellivin
                   - Aelin As period, azure marble

This statue, titled The Order of Aelin, or \#Aelin Enpu\#, used to stand in
the summer home of an extremely wealthy Aelin noble, but that house was
taken during the War of Fire.  After the srryn conquered the small village
where the house stood, they pried the gems out of the eyes of the Rilos
Enpu, but considered the statue itself worthless.  After the War of Fire,
the statue was recovered by the surviving family members, and later donated
to this gallery, where it was restored as best it could be.  

The perfect symmetrical design of the statue is in character with the
Aelin As period, carved in the slightly blue-tinted marble that was often
used by aelin sculptors.  The arm reaching forward is a bit of an
advancement for that time.  The small leaf and crown on his hand signify the
order that the aelin are bringing to the world around them.  The world is
the leaf, and the crown represents order, a symbol of course, for Lord
Iandir.  At the time the statue was carved, the world was still recovering
from the Sundering, so the order brought to the surrounding environment was
an important theme to the Aelin.

statueone~
The statue standing before you is tall, slightly larger than lifesize. 
Carved entirely from marble, the figure of an Aelin stands perfectly
straight, his wide empty eyes, which were once set with gems of some colour,
gaze forward without expression.  His wings arch perfectly symmetrical
behind his back, though time has claimed the upper tip of the left wing,
leaving a smooth worn edge in its absence.  One hand extends forward, and
resting on it is a delicate metal leaf, encircled by a small marble crown. 
His feet are set together, and his other arm lies straight against his side.

A bronze plaque is set into the statue\@s pedestal.

The Kitchens~
The kitchen stretches some fifty feet from east to west, and is perhaps
thirty feet wide.  Every inch seems to be made use of.  Three huge stone
tables down the center of the room are covered with foods in various stages
of preparation.  Vegetables are being chopped, meats prepared, sauces mixed,
and final dishes arranged.  Above these benches hang great iron racks of
cooking implements.  Along the kitchen walls run more benches, above which
hang a huge variety of herbs, spices, roots, fruits, and cured meats.  The
eastern wall is taken up by two enormous wood ovens, while a couple of
smaller stoves stand against the south wall nearby.  In the southeast corner
is an archway set with swinging doors.

Redolent of the exotic south, this large chamber has been
furnished in the style of distant Ashta Harrud.  A magnificent carpet covers
the floor, woven with deep, vibrant colours and complex symbology, around
the edge of which lay many cushions of satin and silk.  A low table of ivory
and jade is set in one corner, its entire surface carved with lines of
flowing script.  A crystal bottle rests on the table, alongside bowls of
exotic foods.  A faint, percussive music pervades the room, its source not
apparent, and is accompanied by a sweet, intoxicating incense.  

A door is set in the north wall, while in the south wall an open archway is
hung with a curtain of beads.  In the west wall, windows look over the
streets of Earendam and on the east wall hangs a magnificent tapestry.

Beneath the High Dome~
A circular platform of white marble is suspended high up in the middle of
this chamber, surrounded on all sides by an airy drop, some sixty feet to
the floor below.  The precarious nature of this perch is enhanced by the
absence of any railing.  Instead, a ring of lush, potted plants stand on its
edge, their sprawling growth creeping across the marble and hanging freely
over the sides.  The plants are studded with beautifully exotic flowers of
many different colours.

Level with the platform, in the walls of the chamber, are a ring of high,
narrow arched windows.  These are interspersed with huge pillars of fluted
marble, which rise to support the great vault of the ceiling.  The arches of
the vault rise to an apex, from which hangs a highly abstract mobile.  Long
arcs carved from bone - perhaps the tusks or ribs of some enormous beast -
form a many-layered sphere, with each arc hanging at a different angle to
the next.  Immediately beneath the mobile, in the center of the platform,
are spread several large cushions.

The whole platform has the impression of floating in mid-air, apparently
supported only by the narrow bridge which leads the outer wall of the
chamber, and so to the stairway down.

symbolvision~
The sensuous arcs of the Tear of Pricina quickly enrapture the eye as you
stare up at it, your eye hungrily tracing each lithesome, evocative curve. 
It seems now that these forms move toward you, or perhaps it is that your
perception moves upward, drawn to the exquisitely petalled nexus at the
heart of the symbol.  

The slender curves of the Tear now surround you, and it becomes clear that
each is merely an outline, a silhouette of some fuller shape.  Before long
these shapes resolve themselves into female forms of shivering beauty.  They
shift and tense their supine figures, as though wracked with some anxious
passion.  And step-by-tentative step they move towards you.  Slender hands,
with skin as pure as porcelain, reach out to you.  In you imagination they
slowly, delicately, remove pieces of your clothing, until their hands brush,
almost nervously, against your skin.  

The heart of the symbol now hangs above you, having resolved into an exotic
orchid, or a complex, many-petalled lotus, beautiful beyond imagining.  You
reach forward to pluck it, eager to make it your own, and the hands of the
surrounding succubi guide your own hands encouragingly.  

But Suddenly you realise that the lotus is no small, delicate flower at all.
It dwarfs you, each of its complex petals larger than your entire body, and
each covered with many rows of inward-pointing spines.  The petals begin to
separate, stretching towards you as they move, revealing a ruddy, gaping maw
in their midst.  The succubi press you from all sides, gripping you with
dozens of hands, each now black as pitch and cruelly clawed, and bite with
full-lipped mouths, each filled with razor teeth.  You are shoved toward the
hungry opening with irresistable force, and the petals grasp at your flesh,
drawing you inwards.  Yet despite your great horror, and the knowledge of
the oblivion which awaits you within that maw, you do not for a moment
consider resisting.  

In an instant the vision passes, and you find yourself lying in Pricina\@s
shrine once more.  Your body quakes slightly, and you realise that you are
unclad.  The Tear of Pricina, however, is forever burned into both your mind
and your soul.

mobile~
As you move around the mobile to view its perspectively, you note that
from directly beneath, the arcs seem to fall into a more meaningful pattern.
While still abstract, this vantage seems to have some sort of resonant,
almost enticing quality.  It occurs to you that by resting on the cushions
and looking up, you would be afforded the perfect view.

From this vantage point, the bone arcs of the mobile seem to fall into

many layers of curves.  These curves now seem quite lithesome and sinuous,
and almost suggestive of deeper, feminine forms.  A wash of warmth floods
your body, and certain passions begin to stir...  

Before long, you recognise this symbol for what it is - the unholy Tear of
Pricina, rendered with a masterful hand and surging with latent power. 
Perhaps you would learn more if you were to study it.

A Marble Antechamber~
A vaulted ceiling of green-veined marble roofs this octagonal
antechamber, atop pillars of similar marble which are set into the walls at
each vertex.  The four cardinal walls are wider than the diagonal walls. 
Against the north and west of these stand comfortable-looking leather
divans, while wide archways open in the south and east walls.

A Sparse Foyer~
Despite bearing all the hallmarks of classical, ornate Republican
fittings, this wide foyer is sparse, nearly bare of decoration beyond what
is actually architected into the walls.  A few austere floral arrangements
grace low tables, and the room is well lit by magical balls of light, but
the frosted globes they are contained in give the room a sterile air.  The
majority of avenues further into the house are sealed tightly, giving the
impression that the emptiness of this place is a simple reaction to the
amount of traffic moving in and out that comes with opening the home to the
public.  The offices of Lord Rotheld lie further within the house, open to
the public as he makes himself available for the election, and the doorway
to the west opens onto the street.

An Austere Office~
This room is very simply designed, with little ornamentation; every
object within seems there to fill a specific purpose.  A wide oaken desk
dominates the floorspace, a row of pens and an inkwell set atop it with
crisp precision.  The chair behind it bears only token padding, and the pair
that sit in front seem to similarly be designed with no eye for comfort. 
Globes of light sit atop two tall stands in the far corners of the room, one
next to a wooden cabinet, and the other next to the only bookshelf in the
room.  The dark blue carpet on the floor is enough to keep heat within the
room, though even its simple, solid shade adds a much-needed splash of
colour to the room.

Entrance to the Bardic Collegium~
The entrance to Earendam\@s famed bardic Collegium is a showy, almost
gaudy affair, making up in exuberance what it lacks in classical taste.  The
floor of the chamber is a checkerboard of black and white marble, flanked by
supporting pillars of the same material.  Overhead, two massive candelabras
brighten the room, their gilded frames dotting the arched ceiling with a
cascade of golden light.  To both the south and the north, an opening lies
between two pillars, while Valvaria street opens to the west.

Auditioning Chamber~
This chamber is used for the judging of students who audition to attend

around a small stage set to the east.  A few soft chairs are scattered
around the floor, most of them facing the stage.  The primary exit from the
audition chamber lies through a narrow opening to the north, while to the
east a small door leads into a practice chamber.

The Chamber of the Hieroglyph~
This chamber is a perfect square, walled in on every side by lifeless
stone bricks.  The air is somewhat stale, and thick, supporting pillars
suggest that this place is far underground.  In the center of the room, a
tall block of dark stone stands freely.  Carved into the stone are deep, red
lines, which trace out a mystical hieroglyph.  The room lacks any other
furnishing or exit, leaving the dark stone as the room\@s only noteworthy
contents.

You gaze upon the dark, rutted landscape of the past.  Primitive humans
chant and sing praises to dark gods.  Before them is a black stone, covered
with diabolic hieroglyphs.  The humans caress it, anointing it with animal
blood.  One of the hieroglyphs glows red, and you realize it is the mark of
the Aklaju.  

Your vision sweeps to the black stone, where you are face to face with the
hieroglyph.  Its eye opens onto the void, and you see as the early humans
did: The horrors awaiting them beyond the veil are always waiting, always
watching, and, most of all, always hungering.

hierohack~
The framework of the Aklaju Hieroglyph is a rigid design of vertical line
segments, capped and joined by short arcs.  Within these regions are a
number of symbolic designs, the most prominent of which is a stylized eye,
with a slitted pupil.  

As you look into the eye of the hieroglyph, you are drawn inward, compelled
to look within.

Just off of South Valaria Street, the foyer to the Guardian office of
Earendam stands.  The building is small and formed of seamless marble, most

The Top of a Flowery Staircase~
A spiral staircase reaches downwards from here, the nearest railings
laden with hydrangea and camellia flowers, and iris and peach further down. 
From this vantage point, a precise and elaborate pattern to the flowers
makes itself distinct, taking advantage both of the colours of the flowers
and the black wrought iron railing.  A thin straight staircase leads up
through a trapdoor to the roof.  Westwards is an open arch into a
maple-paneled room, and eastwards is an open balcony, the sound of splashing
water faintly audible on the other side of the doorframe.

A Balcony Overlooking the Harbour~
This balcony sits just above the city wall, much like others to the left
and right, attached to the houses of nobles.  A simple marble railing curves
around the edge, left bare and unadorned.  Eastwards is a magnificent view
of the bustling harbour and Uthlin ocean beyond it, the angle perfect to
catch the sunrise.  From the rock garden above, a thin fall of water
cascades into a shallow, burbling pool.  A barely perceptible magical field
encases the landing, ensuring the temperature within remains bearable even
in the coldest of winters.

A Wood-Paneled Tea Room~
Paneled in golden maplewood, this room has a pleasant, unobtrusive warmth
to it.  Windows covered in oiled parchment allow light from the street to
enter, without any distracting views of the street.  Austere paintings on
parchment of each of the four flowers the School takes its name from hang
from the walls.  Thick grey mats for sitting on are set neatly about a room,
and a pot of hot tea is kept on a low table near to the centre of the room. 
An open archway breaks up the wall to the east, wood giving way to granite.

A Serene Rooftop Garden~
Of a style rarely seen in Earendam, this garden disdains soil and flowers
in favour of pristine white sand raked into serene, rippling patterns around
large, mossy rocks and small shrubs.  Brightly-coloured fish dance in a pool
lined with grey pebbles, small streams running about the garden beneath
wooden bridges.  A curl of water cascades over the edge of the roof, falling
in a pool on the balcony below.  Wooden rakes lean against the low
surrounding wall, as do small hedge clippers and pruning shears.  A barely
perceptible magical field keeps the worst of the elements away from the
garden and regulates the temperature within.  A small, wooden trapdoor leads
down to the landing below.

Antechamber to the Circle of the Erudite Eye~
This chamber serves as the entrance to the alchemical guild known as the
Circle of the Erudite Eye.  The room is furnished pleasantly, bespeaking the
wealth of the Circle\@s patrons and its focus on the Earendam\@s merchant
class.  Paneled in wood, the antechamber has a warm, inviting feel, with
some of its surfaces bearing intricate lithographs of alchemical symbolism. 
The north-facing windows, which flank the grand entrance, are draped with
green velvet curtains.  A matching curtain, emblazoned with the
circle-within-circle motif of the guild, is draped across the southern
doorway.  To the north, Qalnistra Street awaits.

The Circle of the Erudite Eye~
This intersection serves as the physical and logistical center of the
Circle of the Erudite Eye.  The bulk of the floor is a raised, circular
platform, with small steps leading upward around its circumference.  At the
platform\@s center is a low, wide column, roughly one-third of the platform\@s
diameter.  Upon the top of the column is an iridescent dot which forms the
room\@s spacial center.  Like the antechamber, the walls are paneled in rich
wood, and braziers provide light from the chamber\@s corners.  Open archways
lead east and west, while a gold-crested arch leads to the south.  A velvet
curtain is draped across the northern passage.

Laboratory of the Erudite Eye~
The main laboratory of the Circle of the Erudite Eye is arranged with a
cluster of centralized iron cauldrons.  A bed of rocks, marked with the red
glow of Fire runes, provide a constant, continual heat from below them. 
Work benches line the laboratory\@s walls, covered in a wide variety of
alchemical aparati.  Mortars and pestles, glass vials and beakers, and an
array of other supplies rest upon the workspaces or shelves above.  Charts
hang around the room, covered in alchemical symbols or phrases of
encouragement from past students.  The only exit to the laboratory is to the
east, through an open archway.

Within the Circle of the Erudite Eye is a small library, arranged with a
myriad of oak tables and chairs.  The walls are paneled in wood, but mostly
obscured by the tall oak bookshelves which line them on three sides.  The
library contains no windows, but is instead lit by crystal hemispheres
affixed in circle to the ceiling.  The floor is carpeted to dull the sound
of moving chairs or adjusted tables, and a few potted plants decorate the
space between shelves.  To the west, an open archway leads back to the
guild\@s center, providing the library\@s only exit.

Within the Circle of the Erudite Eye, personal chambers have been set
aside for the guild\@s current headmaster.  The room is decorated lavishly,
the mundane woods of the Circle\@s paneling transitioning into rich mahogany.
A matching writing desk serves as the chamber\@s focal point, ornamented with
personal effects and various letters and scrolls.  Three large windows are
set into the east, south, and west walls, each warded with protective magic.
Green velvet curtains and complementary carpet provide most of the room\@s
color, with decorative plants at the chamber\@s corners.  The central hub of
the guild lies through the northern archway.

A Cluttered Library~
Though this room is lined with bookshelves, it is difficult to judge
whether it could be more aptly named a library or a laboratory.  A workbench
sits to one side, topped by a clutter of still-smoking censers, arcane
trinkets and small piles of ash adorned with what might be tiny white bones.
A few sitting benches have been laid out here; judging from the marks on the
floor they might once have even been organized into neat rows.  Now they are
at odds angles to the walls and heaped high with piles of books and scrolls
which never made it back to the shelves.

This room has been laid out for individual study, complete with rows of

The walls have been lined with bookshelves stuffed with all manner of texts,
ranging from the general arcane to focused studies of water magics.  A
number of anatomical primers are stacked on a table in a corner, next to an
odd apparatus of bronze and glass.  Several portraits hang on the walls, the
visages of famous magi long since deceased.

Etziza Glassworks~
A storefront occupies a good half of this atelier, showcasing a number of
delicate glass constructions on the shelves.  Bottles and carafes are among
the most prominent, though other house-wares such as plates and candle
holders are placed with them as well.  Showcases protect intricate figurines
and brightly-coloured jewelry, and runes against breakage and theft are
etched into the frames.  Past a wrought-iron railing is a glass kiln, with a
stool set nearby, and a rack of tools on the nearby wall.  From the ceiling
hang a myriad of coloured glass balls, making the workshop seem smaller than
it actually is.  The storefront window is of leaded, stained glass in an
abstract pattern, mimicking the style of woven carpets.

A Pleasantly Decorated Home~
An atmosphere of comfort surrounds this spacious room.  Spanning part of
the hardwood floor is a large pale rug, tastefully interwoven with threads
of blue and green about the edges.  In one corner stands a double sleigh bed
carved from a rich, dark oak and overlaid with a thick mattress.  Near the
bed, a small nightstand rests just below a blue-tinted window.  During the
day, sunlight seems to veritably pour through the glass, richly illuminating
most of the room.  One corner seems perpetually dim, however, lit only by
the dancing flames of the homey basalt fireplace.  The emblem of a regal
crown is inlaid over the mantle, its bright lines providing a appealing
contrast to the greenish-black gloss of the stone.  Two chairs and a small
table fill the corner just left of the door.  Across from these simple
furnishings a small spring bubbles, the miniature geyser of pure water
falling into a circular moat carved in the floor for that purpose.

This wide hall is made from old, large blocks of smooth, pale stone.  A

made from a circle of braided rags, lies in the center of the floor.

Tyvor\@s Signets~
This small shop is an anomaly on Calvala Street, as its interior is far
dimmer and more well-weathered than its upscale neighbor.  A series of low
glass cases, warded with faint runes of earth, present a variety of sample
rings which demonstrate the proprietor\@s formidable skill.  A worn, wooden
workbench sits on the north side of the room, lit by a crooked table lamp. 
Upon it, jeweler\@s tools are arranged just so, with model wax rings set in a
neat pile nearby.  The floor is well swept and the establishment clean, with
natural light augmenting the lamplight during the daylight hours.  A doorway
leads east, back to the street and Earendam\@s merchant quarter.  

A large black slate hangs from the wall.

A Private Performance Chamber~
This small room offset from the entrance to the Collegium has a garish
look.  Black and white marble tiles alternate across the floor, and a
decorative pillar of each material stands in each of the four corners of the
room.  Gilt sconces on each wall hold brightly-glowing balls of light, their
shine focused on a slightly raised dais in the center of the floor.  A
gold-inlaid oaken bench runs between the pillars on the west, north, and
east walls.

A Quiet Practice Room~
The gaudiness of the rest of the Collegium stops as you pass through the
entrance to this small room.  A few small lamps illuminate the area, their
bases and glass hoods etched in intricate patterns.  White and black marble
covers the floor in a checkerboard pattern, and the stones themselves are
polished to a glassy sheen.  Music stands and assorted shelves holding a
variety of practice instruments line the walls of the chamber, which are
themselves paneled in dark, polished wood, improving the acoustics of the
chamber.

The Sea Spire~
A spiral staircase fills the centre of this room, allowing light in from
above to shine on the climbing vines that line each side of it, slim
waterfalls dividing the creepers and forming a shallow pool.  Several tables
are set poised about, oriented such that both the splashing of water and the
positioning afford each diner a modicum of privacy in conversation.  A
curving wooden bar is set before the back wall, ensuring only staff move in
and out of the door to the kitchens.  Several paintings line the other
walls, deftly set in spots where the light from above will highlight them
throughout the day.

The plaque reads: The Sea Spire wishes to thank its investors of houses
Ralista and Vahendra, and thanks houses Averitus and E\@Daeril for their
contributions.  
~
E
fifth entrance~
This painting distinguishes itself from the others chosen for this
restaurant by being of live subjects, rather than landscapes or still lives.
Several well-dressed aelin are carefully posed and masterfully-rendered; a
tall man with long white hair and a string of beads falling against his face
stands in the centre, and a woman with golden hair in a vibrant green dress
stands beside him.  Offset but still prominent are a slightly less-tall
dark-haired woman, standing near to an unusually large, ponytailed man.  A
small golden plaque is tastefully set beneath the painting.  
~
E
painting paintings walls~
Four paintings depicting a scene of the sky above Ilodaiya stand out most
obviously on the walls, the glinting spires of the highest reaches of the
city reaching upward on the canvas, but not distracting from the majesty of
the skies and clouds.  Each painting seems to depict the scene at a
different time of day, and their positioning highlights this expertly; each
is marked out by the light from above best at the time shown in the
painting.  

Of the remaining paintings, a fifth by the entrance stands out as being
particularly notable.  
~
E
bar back curved curving~
The smooth, polished bar appears to be remarkably well-stocked with a
variety of alcohols both domestic and foreign, though the labels show an
obvious but understandable bias towards aelin and Ilodaiyan distillers.  
~
E
spiral stairs staircase stairway waterfall waterfalls pool vine vines creeper creepers plants~
The wide marble staircase that leads to the upper level has a plethora of
vines and plants hanging from its railings.  Deftly-concealed spots where
the vines have been cut show that the plants are not entirely decorative;
they appear to be used as a small garden for the restaurant.  Thin streams
of water flow from above, feeding the plants and splashing into a small pool
on the ground, creating some unobtrusive background noise.  Every now and
again, some small fish leap out of the pool, to deter those who might use
the pool to drink from.

The Upper Level of the Sea Spire~
A faint, pleasant breeze shifts through the upper level, the solidified
air shimmering faintly when birds draw too nearby, warding them off.  Piles
of soft, embroidered cushions are strewn beside low tables here, easily
shifted and moved for better comfort.  A pool of water encircles the
stairwell, trickling down to the floor below between the vines that creep
upwards, twining around the railing.  A small bar stands unobtrusively to
the back, not interfering with the spectacular view of the Dantaron, Salyra
nearby in the northwest, and the Palace a bit to the northeast.

E
bar back~
This bar is rather smaller than the one downstairs, but more
heavily-used; it appears to see a great deal of use, and staff frequently
comes and goes, shifting stock between the two floors.  
~
E
view dantaron salyra palace northwest northeast~
The fully windowed northern half of the restaurant provides a picturesque
view of the city to the north, Salyra standing tall and the great domes of
the Patrician\@s palace glittering in the light.  Below, the traffic of the
Dantaron moves by, as merchants and citizens both use the water to carry out
their business.  The only barely-visible magical field used to screen out
the elements ensures the view is far clearer than any modern glassmaking
techniques would allow for such a large surface, and allows a breeze through
when weather permits.  
~
E
table tables~
Each table is outfitted with an elegant, swirled glass hookah, each
bearing several mouthpieces, allowing multiple guests to share comfortably. 
If you were to rest on the cushions, you could take the nearest mouthpiece
and {Winhale{x, if you so chose.

A Stone Garden~
The walls of this indoor garden have been intricately carved to resemble
layers of ivy, arching and and forming almost a canopy overhead, the stone
all subtly painted to suggest at life.  Smooth stone divans and benches form
a rough circle near to the centre of the grounds, close enough for quiet
conversation.  Elegant sculptures of flowers line paths about the garden,
painted to near-lifelike vivacity.  Much as in elsewhere in the garden,
small shrubs and bushes provide a visual contrast to the statuery, all
verdant green.  A remarkable statue of a tree reaches to nearly touch the
vines, and statues of an aelin man and woman stand by the entrance to the
west.

Small sculptures of lilies and roses line the garden paths, the flowers
painted into pristine whiteness.  
~
E
tree~
This tall sculpture of a tree seems so real that it almost looks to be
growing.  It even bears distinct, purple fruit hanging amidst the boughs,
hardly looking to be stone at all.  
~
E
statue statues~
The bulk of the garden\@s artistry lies in statuery.  A statue of a tree
stands near to the centre, and statues of a pair of aelin by the entrance. 
Around the paths are numerous sculptures of flowers.  
~
E
aelin man woman entrance~
A pair of white marble statues depict flowing, stylized aelin, one a man,
the other a woman.  Inscriptions are marked out at the base of each statue. 

The man\@s frame and features are classicaly aelin, robes cut in a style
popular in Earendam several years ago.  His hair hangs about shoulders, in a
similarly stylish cut.  His wings are tucked behind him, and one arm reaches
outwards, over the entryway.  

The woman has a severe look to her, expression taut but otherwise
inscrutable.  Her hair is pinned up in a restrictive style.  Serving as
marked contrast, her wings reach outwards, and she is depicted in a loose
and flowing dress.  She too reaches an arm out and over the entryway.  

The statues do not quite form a full arch; their fingers strain toward each
other but merest inches separate them from contact.  
~
E
inscription inscriptions base~
The base of the pedestal that the statue of the aelin man stands upon is
inscribed with the name \#Ilhaed Aelosor, Archmage of Earth\#.  At the base of
the statue of the woman, a similar marking reads \#Tesraella Kaelin, the Lady
of Night\#.

A Fashionable Boutique~
This boutique is painted in a rich, verdant green, with mahogany trim
accenting the walls.  Minimalist displays of clothing are set on mannequins
and dressmaker\@s dummies about the room, with a discreet, curtained room to
one side for taking measurements and final fittings.  A dark-paneled display
case to the side highlights a number of accessories and pieces of jewelry. 
Several portraits of fashionably-dressed aelin hang from the walls, and a
tall glass mirror stands freely near to a display.

E
man~
In a dark, mahogany frame hangs a portrait of a middle-aged aelin
gentleman of firm features and deep brown eyes.  His pale hair is cut to
fall overtop his ears in an old-fashioned, but classical style. 
Contrariwise, he is dressed in more modern adaptations of typical styles,
silver buttons gleaming down the front of a shirt that is deftly wrapped to
allow his blond wings freedom of movement.  
~
E
woman~
In a pale, maplewood frame hangs a portrait of an aelin woman, a string
of emeralds threaded through her upswept, golden hair.  That vivid green
shade is repeated in her eyes, her long, dangling earrings, and the large
cabochon pendant at her throat.  Her dress is a sweeping, airy affair of
that same emerald green and gold, modestly accentuating her more salient
features and allowing her glossy black wings to spread freely behind her.  
~
E
portrait portraits~
While several portraits hang from the walls, two stand out in particular,
both particularly fine and recent-seeming work of an aelin man and a woman,
hanging opposite each other.  
~
E
mannequins mannequin dummy dummies~
Several mannequins and dressmaker\@s dummies sit about the room, with
typically small difference between the male and female figures.  All have
short nubs to suggest wings, for proper draping and display of the clothing,
which itself is a clear explanation for the relative androgyny of both
dummies and clothing styles.
