stony jhtenfountain curvaceous stony fountain~
This stony fountain erupts, trumpetlike, from deep in the heart of
Jh\@ten.  The rough material is reminiscent of limestone or old coral, yet
slightly translucent; glimmers of light play subtly beneath its surface. 
Gnarled and organic in shape, it catches water in a shallow pool at its

Outside the Gates of Jh\@ten~
A silvery road passes over the gleaming emerald waters of the Bay of Shao
here, as stable and as dry as if it were laid over the flattest of plains. 
The waters crash tempestuously against the rocks at the base of the walls of
Jh\@ten, close enough to send spray flying here but the water lapping at the
edge of the path is as placid as could be.  The salt in the air is thick
here, giving each breath a distinctly marine taste.  The road winds its way
over the Bay to the northwest and the verdant mainland of Alensha. 
Southward, the gleaming golden walls of Jh\@ten stretch out, surrounding a
wide gap that stands open, affording an eye level view of an expansive
forest just beyond.  Spirit-lights sparkle above a tiny point of something
crystalline that gleams in the distance, and the great spires of the city\@s
temple to Rystaia reach even further to pierce the heavens.

into the rocks beneath.  The odd spirit-light can be seen sparking high up
into the air in a brilliant splash of colour, and not even the walls can
dwarf the great spires at the centre of the city, twisting so high the tops
can barely be seen from here.

Inside the Gates of Jh\@ten~
The great golden walls of Jh\@ten come to a natural gap here, parting to
allow passage onto the mainland over a smooth, silvery road.  The emerald
waters of the Bay of Shao lap close to the road where it drifts toward the
water, but that seems to not make the path appreciably more slippery in the
least.  The warm salt scent of the air is strongest here, tickling the nose
with its marine tang.  To the east and west, stairs have been carved up to
the tops of the walls, following their smooth, faint curves.  Southward the
silver road begins to meander through a great, cultivated grove of ironwood
and pines that grow almost to the wall itself.  The tip of a clear, tear-
shaped building can be seen from here, rising over the tops of the trees
from a hill to the southeast, gleaming in the drifting spirit-lights.  Far
to the southeast, you can make out the wild, reaching spires of the temple
of Rystaia at the centre of the city.

The tall, pointed tip of the building is made of a glittering,

E
temple spire spires rystaia~
The spires of the temple are easily the tallest thing that can be seen
from here, perpetually wreathed in frothy whips of mist and light.

The great golden walls of Jh\@ten come to a natural gap here, but a great
outgrowth of spiny-looking coral, like a golden briar bush blocks up that
gap.  A smooth, silvery road drifts to a stop just before the blockage,
fading so fluidly as to make it difficult to tell where it actually ends.  A
marine tang faintly tickles the nose here, as if from far further away than
would be suggested by the nearness of Bay of Shao.  To the east and west,
stairs have been carved up to the tops of the walls, following their smooth,
faint curves.  Southward the silver road begins to meander through a great,
cultivated grove of ironwood and pines that grow almost to the wall itself.

Atop the Golden Walls of Jh\@ten~
These magnificent golden walls tower above the Bay of Shao, whose emerald
green waters lap against the rocks of the shore far below.  Tracing a
winding, almost serendipitous course, the walls protect the northwestern arm
of the haven of Jh\@ten.  The most visible part of the city from here is not
actually cultivated -- the interior is instead forest.  Beginning with
copses of Brintorean pines and Qilarni ironwood towards the west, the native
trees stop when they reach a high hill on which is set a teardrop-shaped
clear building.  From there grow the fabled Al\@Wye, whose quicksilver trunks
reflect and dazzle.  Further east a giant structure made of mother of pearl
shell is ensconced in the wall and has a network of gardens and fountains
south of it.  Taller even than these walls though is the temple of Rystaia,
whose wild spires mark the center of the haven.  The walls continue to the
south, and end in a gate-like structure to the west.

golden~
Following the wall\@s course is an exercise in tracing graceful but

as the songs say -- it is instead a kind of coral material.  It appears
amazingly durable for a material which upon closer examination appears to be
a less-than-solid lattice of calcified matter.  The exterior is sharp to the
touch and threatens injury to unassisted climbers, while the interior is
polished to a smooth buff.

Atop the Golden Walls of Jh\@ten~
These magnificent golden walls tower above the Bay of Shao, whose emerald
green waters lap against the rocks of the shore far below.  The walls follow
a swooping and bending course, protecting the northwestern arm of the haven
of Jh\@ten from assault by sea.  South and west of here grows a forest of the
fabled Al\@Wye, whose quicksilver trunks reflect and dazzle.  Due south of
here is a spiral structure, tucked into a fold of the wall and made of some
iridescent material resembling mother of pearl.  Beyond it lies a network of
gardens and fountains, which connect to the center of the haven.  There
stands the temple of Rystaia, whose wild spires pierce the low-hanging
clouds over the city, dwarfing everything else in Jh\@ten.  From here, the
walls wind to both the west and north, and a narrow stair leads down
to the ground near the entrance to the spiral building.

Following the wall\@s course is an exercise in tracing graceful but
unexpected curves.  Golden in appearance, the wall is not actually ch\@lonin
as the songs say -- it is instead a kind of coral material.  It appears
amazingly durable for a material which upon closer examination appears to be
a less-than-solid lattice of calcified matter.  The exterior is sharp to the
touch and threatens injury to unassisted climbers, while the interior is
polished to a smooth buff.

building~
This building looks as though it were almost carved out of a giant,
spiral shell, growing out of the ground.  Its surface is almost luminescent,
replete with oranges, golds, reds, and even the occasional purples or blue. 
With closer examination, it seems that these colors change not just with the
angle of view, but also over time -- gently shifting to some internal rhythm
so that one or another gradually comes to dominate, then fades.

Atop the Golden Walls of Jh\@ten~
These magnificent golden walls tower above Jh\@ten, equal parts protection
for the interior of the haven and sea wall for a glimmering lagoon to the
south.  The most visible part of the city from here is actually forested
land.  Beginning with copses of Brintorean pines and Qilarni ironwood towards
the west, the native trees stop when they reach a high hill on which is set
a teardrop-shaped clear building.  From there grow the fabled Al\@Wye, whose
quicksilver trunks reflect and dazzle.  Knitting these two disparate regions
together is a silver path, which fairly darts through the warp and woof of
all the forests in sight.  Further east a network of gardens and fountains
is visible, leading towards the center of the Jh\@ten.  There, the wild
spires of the temple of Rystaia are easily the tallest structure in the
haven.  The walls continue to the south, but come to an end after meeting a
gate-like structure to the east.  The only way down to the ground of the
forest below is via a set of stairs carved in the interior of the walls.

Atop the Golden Walls of Jh\@ten~
These magnificent golden walls tower above Jh\@ten, equal parts protection
for the interior of the haven and sea wall for a glimmering lagoon to the
south.  The walls follow a swooping and bending course, protecting the
northwestern arm of the haven of Jh\@ten from assault by sea.  North and west
of here grows a forest of the fabled Al\@Wye, whose quicksilver trunks
reflect and dazzle.  Directly north of here is a network of gardens and
fountains, alive with vivid floral growth and lush trees.  Past the gardens
is a spiral shell-like structure, tucked in a fold of the north wall. 
Eastward lies the center of the haven, where stands the temple of Rystaia,
whose wild spires pierce the low-hanging clouds over the city, dwarfing
everything else in Jh\@ten.  From here, the wall bends north and south, and a
set of stairs carved in the interior of the wall leads down to the Al\@Wye

A Verdant Glade~
This verdant glade is carpeted with soft, flowing grass, and surrounded
on all sides by pines and flowering goldenrain trees.  Overhead drift wispy
bits of spirit-light and hazy pollen, accenting rays which give the place a
constant feel of light in the morning.  The warm air and rich soil of Jh\@ten
have left the forests about the glade thick with foliage and greenery, but
there is a pronounced absence of weeds and other thorny underbrush.  At

This is a forest of tall, sleek pines, redolent with the smell of pine
gum and the spicy tang of the air in Jh\@ten.  Small shrubs and vines grow
here and there, but the most of the ground is kept free of other plants by

Large, branching oaks grow everywhere, and no path is visible to trace a
course through this overhanging forest.  Covered with broad, leafy branches,
the trees bear the fat acorns characteristic of those which grow in the
woods of Nendor.  Squirrels and other small woodland animals occasionally
peek into sight, but then just as quickly vanish up the trunks of the oaks,
or down burrows near the base of the trees.  Brightening up shady areas are
spirit-lights, which float through any gloom and shine with an effervescent

A Gentle Slope in a Goldenrain Forest~
Goldenrain trees grow scattershot here across a gentle slope.  Bountiful

drifting spirit-lights that wreath the treeline.  Down the slope to the

A Forest of Goldenrain Trees~
Goldenrain trees grow here with wild abandon.  Bountiful and lush, their
rounded boughs are laden with vivid yellow buds.  Native to Alensha, these
trees nevertheless flourish here in the woodlands of Jh\@ten.  Small shrubs
and flowering plants also grow, somehow managing to be everywhere while not
actually being underfoot.  Without the glow of the spirit-lights that drift
silently through the air, little identifies this place as even being on
Jh\@ten -- the woods are thick enough that there is nothing other than forest

Near the Edge of the Goldenrain Forest~
Goldenrain trees grow here with wild abandon.  Bountiful and lush, their
rounded boughs are laden with vivid yellow buds.  Native to Alensha, these
trees nevertheless flourish here in the woodlands of Jh\@ten.  From here,
signs of that haven are readily apparent -- from the subtle drift of
spirit-lights which illuminate the shadows of the forest to the towering
walls of Jh\@ten, which peek over the edges of trees.  Trails deeper into the
woods lead north and south, while a zig-zagging staircase is visible on the
part of the wall visible to the west.

spirit lights~
The spirit-lights are little gossamer things of light and mist,

A Forest of Goldenrain Trees~
Goldenrain trees grow here with wild abandon.  Bountiful and lush, their
rounded boughs are laden with vivid yellow buds.  Native to Alensha, these
trees nevertheless flourish here in the woodlands of Jh\@ten.  Small shrubs
and flowering plants also grow, somehow managing to be everywhere while not
actually being underfoot.  Without the glow of the spirit-lights that drift
silently through the air, little identifies this place as even being on
Jh\@ten -- the woods are thick enough that there is nothing other than forest
within sight.

A Small Hill in a Copse of Qilarni Ironwoods~
This copse of ironwood grows on the side of a small hill.  Their dark
brown bark and glossy green leaves mark them as being Qilarni, where they
are much-loved by the ethron .  The warm, humid air of Jh\@ten has done
wonders for them, turning them into fairly tall specimens of their breed. 
Looking up to the top of the hill, an unusual building made from a crystal
teardrop is visible, glittering in a flock of drifting spirit-lights.  The
ironwoods maintain some space between each other, revealing the high golden
walls of Jh\@ten to the west.  The forest continues unabated in most other
directions, but a very out of place trail paved with some silverish glass
begins just to the south of here.

A Gentle Hill in a Forest of Nendorin Oaks~
Large, branching oaks grow everywhere on this gentle hill.  Covered with
broad, leafy branches, the trees bear the fat acorns characteristic of those
which grow in the woods of Nendor.  Squirrels and other small woodland
animals occasionally peek into sight, but then just as quickly vanish up the
trunks of the oaks, or down burrows near the base of the trees.  Brightening
up shady areas are spirit-lights, which float through any gloom and shine
with an effervescent silver light.  Looking up the slope, a unusual building
made from a crystal teardrop is visible, glittering from same drifting
spirit-lights.  Forest continues in every other direction, wrapping around

North End of the Eth\@Mava~
The eth\@mava is a greenhouse on a grand scale, enfolded by teardrop-
shaped walls of impossibly thin crystal soaring overhead.  Shaped by the
magic of druids and scholars of earth, the entire edifice is a gift from the
ethron of Alensha to Jh\@ten.  Built to protect the rare and often delicate
flora of the ch\@taren\@s original home, the interior is a sprawling riot of
plants; some on terraces, others in freestanding urns, but most left free to
grow unimpeded.  Soft, golden light suffuses everything here, punctuated by
the brilliant but momentary sparkles from spirit-lights drifting through the
hothouse-haze of the air.  The smells of the place teeter somewhere between
an olfactory symphony and cacophony -- a heady performance that mixes floral
aromas with saffron, jasmine, and citrus, all interlaced with the faint
cinnamon spice smell of the haven.  To the south lies the center of the
greenhouse, while a tingle in the air to the north marks the exit from this
place.

The Center of the Eth\@Mava~
The center of the eth\@mava is a treasure trove of rare, delicate, and
magical flora from the ch\@taren\@s original home.  Evanescent orchids
condense into being, then fade just as quickly when they are subjected to
attention.  Several intricate gold bushes make a faint sound like chimes
whenever a breeze rustles by, and circles of glittering flowers ring
ironwood benches for visitors to rest.  Two installations demand notice: one
is a mirror-barked Al\@Wye tree growing on a mound of soil from Jh\@ten. 
Another is a gargantuan golden flower, easily as tall as a man and as broad
as a horse.  Overhead, tear-drop shaped walls of impossibly thin crystal
glass come to a point, protecting the contents of the greenhouse with an
edifice fused from a daring combination of earth and druidical magic. 
Honey-yellow light suffuses the room from all points, punctuated by the
brilliant but momentary sparkles from spirit-lights drifting through the
hothouse-haze of the air.  Exits in every direction lead only to more of the
greenhouse.

The bushes are incredibly dense, and in fact it is impossible to discern
anything about what lies inside them.  What is clear is that some musical

find in a tropical region, but their similarities to reality end.  Every
part of the tree is like a quicksilver mirror, reflecting a dazzling
kaleidoscope of the light and its surroundings.  This Al\@Wye bears some
large, if immature nuts, which grow on the very top of the tree.  

In the front of the tree is a wooden marker.

East End of the Eth\@Mava~
The eth\@mava is a greenhouse on a grand scale, enfolded by
teardrop-shaped walls of impossibly thin crystal soaring overhead.  Shaped
by the magic of druids and scholars of earth, the entire edifice is a gift
from the ethron of Alensha to Jh\@ten.  Built to protect the rare and often
delicate flora of the ch\@taren\@s original home, the interior is a sprawling
riot of plants; some on terraces, others in freestanding urns, but most left
free to grow unimpeded.  Soft, golden light suffuses everything here,
punctuated by the brilliant but momentary sparkles from spirit-lights
drifting through the hothouse-haze of the air.  The smells of the place
teeter somewhere between an olfactory symphony and cacophony -- a heady
performance that mixes floral aromas with saffron, jasmine, and citrus, all
interlaced with the faint cinnamon spice smell of the haven.  To the west
lies the center of the greenhouse, while a tingle in the air to the east
marks the exit from this place.  

To go here: Translucent butterflies.

A Copse of Qilarni Ironwoods on a Steep Rise~
This copse of ironwood grows on the side of a steep rise.  Their dark
brown bark and glossy green leaves mark them as being of Qilarn, where they
are much-loved by the ethron.  The warm, humid air of Jh\@ten has done
wonders for the trees, turning them into fairly tall specimens of their
breed.  Looking north to the top of the rise, an unusual building made from
a crystal teardrop is visible, glittering in a flock of drifting spirit-
lights.  Down the rise and to the south, ironwoods slowly thin out and are
replaced by a thick forest of Al\@Wye -- fabled for their mirrored bark. 
Conventional woodlands proceed in every other direction, wrapping around the
hill that makes up this rise.

Between Silver and Gold~
This commonplace strip of land commands an uncommon view.  It runs
between a towering golden wall to the north and a forest of trees with
quicksilver bark to the south.  The wall keeps pace with the winding and
twisting course of the reflecting forest, with forms and design which seem
every bit as organic as the silver flora.  The trees shimmer with light, but
their mirror-like surface reveals little about the interior of the woods.

Amongst the Al\@Wye~

Al\@Wye, each clad in perfect mirror-like bark.  The faintest fog of gold
covers the treeline, a mix of the cool, moist air and the spicy-floral
exhalations of the omnipresent Jh\@ten.  Despite the tall height and broad,
overhanging leaves of the trees, soft light pervades this area -- some
leaking through the fog, but most from spirit-lights which drift by,
reflected in the trees.  Determining any fixed path or even sign of

These tall, broad-leaved trees are shaped like any other tree one might

Jh\@ten~
Huge, silver fronds burst out of the ground, each topped with an
exquisite feather tip from which a flood of orange-gold spores emerges. 
Taking a breath here means inhaling some of these spores and their thick,
almost cloying cinnamon scent.  Despite the appearance that the fronds are
growing out of the ground, there is almost no soil here; instead there is
mix of shell and coral, piebald-patterned and warm to the top.  It is atop
this shell that is the heart of the largest cluster of fronds where the haze
of spores is thickest, totally filling the air.  Glimmering spirit-lights
dance and swirl around the tops of the fronds, their radiance diffusing all
around, giving everything here a numinous glow.  Surrounding the area is a
forest of the silver-barked Al\@Wye trees, which provide enough space around
the fronds to turn this into a kind of clearing.

Silvery-white, these fronds unfurl from holes in the ground with giant,
flowing stalks easily taller than an alatharya.  Crowning each stalk is a
feathery and divided \#leaf\#, which is a network of pink feathery thin
filaments.  Even when the wind is silent, the fronds stir and shudder.  With
every bit of motion, their tips let out a cloud of orange spores, which feel
the air with a redolent cinnamon haze.

A Ch\@taren Topiary~
This is the southern end of a what passes for a formal garden among the
ch\@taren.  Spirit-lights drift over the silvery grass underfoot, and a
hodge-podge of unique and unusual trees trace out a border for this place. 
Fantastically shaped hedges and bushes are scattered throughout the area. 
Despite their somewhat random placement, shapes can be discerned in the
bushes: A leviathan, a dragon, an elephant, several humanoid figures, and
several unrecognizable creatures.  From here, more of the garden extends to
the north, and exits through the trees leave in every other direction.

E
leviathan~
This waxy, green bush has been trimmed into the shape of an enormous
leviathan.  A creature out of the fables of sailors on the Uthlin, it has
been depicted here as having triangular fins and wriggling tentacles, both
exaggerated for dramatic effect.  
~
E
dragon~
This dragon has been carved out of a bush with red-gold leaves. 
Fantastic and soaring, it has a long, trailing tail and bat wings.  Its
claws and teeth are cut with particular care, and designed to invoke a
moment of terror in their contemplation.  
~
E
elephant~
This elephant has been cut out of a bush with blue-grey flowers and green
leaves.  One of its front legs is arched high, and its trunk arcs up in a
silent trumpet.  Despite being made with some care, the proportions of the
elephant seem a bit off -- as if the topiary gardener who made this had
never seen an elephant in the flesh.  
~
E
figures~
The humanoid figures appear to be knights or templars of some kind,
trimmed out of bushes with bright yellow leaves.  Carrying shields and
swinging daring swords, the knights glare across the garden at the dragon.  
~
E
unrecognized~
Some of the creatures could almost be abstract shapes -- wavering
toruses, sharp right angles, and even a bush trimmed into a spiral.  A few
are a little more visible organic: A starfish shape with dangling tendrils
underneath, and a fat triangle with dozens of little legs.

A Small Orchard~
This is the western end of what passes for a formal garden among the
ch\@taren.  A small orchard of fruit bearing trees grow all around here, of
varying shapes and sizes but all native to Jh\@ten.  Small benches are
arranged scattershot about the grounds; most in the shade, but a few in open
clearings.  Drifting through the branches of the trees are the haven\@s
ubiquitous spirit-lights, which peak through the branches like twinkling
will-o\@-the-wisps.  From here, the center of the garden lies to the east,
while a slender trail slips into a forest of quicksilver silver to the west.

To do: Put benches and fruit trees here (consult Kestrel on fruits).

This is the northern end of what passes for a formal garden among the

A Gazebo in a Flower Garden~
This is the eastern end of what passes for a formal garden among the
ch\@taren.  Long curves of flowers twist and spiral everywhere here, a
rainbow of wild and striking colors.  Amidst the center of the garden sits a
white gazebo, built on top of a small rise to catch any errant breezes.  The
garden extends from here to the west, opening in a wider area centered
around a fountain.  A curious path of translucent silver leaves the garden
to the east, passing through a low wall of pink coral to enter the center of
the haven.  There, the wild spires of the temple of Rystaia tower over
everything else in Jh\@ten, wreathed in frothy whips of mist and a veritable

Near the Home of the Ilrel\@sai~
A great, spiral shell grows out of the ground here.  Its surface is
resplendent, almost glowing with striking oranges, golds, reds, and even the
occasional purples or blue.  Home to the bardic conclave known as the
Ilrel\@sai, it is safely ensconced in a northern fold of Jh\@ten\@s walls. 
Almost as tall as the ramparts of those same walls, it is surrounded by a
flock of the spirit-lights which drift through the haven\@s skies.  Away from
the wall to the south lies an extensive network of gardens and fountains. 
The walls continue to the west, while an unusual path of translucent silver
winds off to the east towards Jh\@ten\@s center.  The only other exit lies up
a narrow zig-zagging staircase which has been carved to the side of the
Ilrel\@sai.

Home to the ch\@taren bardic conclave known as the Ilrel\@sai (\#Song

giant spiral shell.  Growing seamlessly out of the loamy soil of Jh\@ten, its
surface is iridescent -- a mother of pearl type material, replete with
oranges, golds, reds, and even the occasional purples or blue.  With closer
examination, it seems that these colors change not just with the angle of
view, but also over time -- gently shifting to some internal rhythm so that
one or another gradually comes to dominate, then fades.

Following the wall\@s course is an exercise in tracing graceful but

Amazingly durable and thick, the interior has been polished to a smooth
buff.  Effectively unclimbable, a zig-zagging staircase carved in the face
of the wall fortunately allows ascent to its heights.

unexpected curves.  Golden in appearance, the wall is about the same color
as the fabled ch\@lonin, but is in actuality a kind of coral material. 
Amazingly durable and thick, the interior has been polished to a smooth
buff.  Effectively unclimbable, a zig-zagging staircase carved in the face
of the wall fortunately allows ascent to its heights.

ilrel\@sai~
Home to the ch\@taren bardic conclave known as the Ilrel\@sai (\#Song
Dreamer\# or \#Dream Singers\# depending on the scholar), this building is a
giant spiral shell.  Growing seamlessly out of the loamy soil of Jh\@ten, its
surface is iridescent -- a mother of pearl type material, replete with
oranges, golds, reds, and even the occasional purples or blue.  With closer
examination, it seems that these colors change not just with the angle of
view, but also over time -- gently shifting to some internal rhythm so that
one or another gradually comes to dominate, then fades.

A great, spiral shell grows out of the ground here.  In the darkness of
night, it glows with phosphorescent oranges, golds, reds, and even the
occasional purples or blue.  Home to the bardic conclave known as the
Ilrel\@sai, it is safely ensconced in a northern fold of Jh\@ten\@s walls. 
Almost as tall as the ramparts of those same walls, it is surrounded by its

In the Home of the Ilrel\@Sai~
Home to the bardic conclave known as the Ilrel\@sai, this chamber
resembles the interior of some great shell.  Phosphorescent walls pulse with
an internal rhythm, and a spiral path corkscrews up and around, reaching all
the way to a platform high above.  Most striking is the Aenea, a well dug
into the surface of Jh\@ten and located directly to the north of here. 
Spirit-lights jet up in and out of its depths, rising to the top of the
chamber and then drifting gently down from there.  The chamber is
acoustically perfect; sound from the top platform sounds as though it is
inches away, and the beginnings of some deeper notes can be felt through
vibrations in the floor and air.  A simple archway provides an exit in the
shell wall to the south, while the spiral path curves around the Aenea,
eventually ascending to the west.

A Spiral Path~
This spiral paths bends and swoops around the walls of this chamber,
which resembles the interior of some great shell.  Near the empty space in
the center jets a column of spirit-lights, illuminating everything around
them.  Looking down, the wispy lights come from a deep well in the surface
of ground, leading far below Jh\@ten.  Looking up, the lights become less
frenetic as they hit the ceiling and swirl around a raised platform at the
very top of the ramp.  The phosphorescent walls are dotted with nearly a
dozen niches, each wide enough for a man to easily stand.  Listening
carefully, the low notes of a powerful harmonic sound reverberate around the
spiral and through those same niches, testament to the perfection of the
chamber\@s geometry.  From here, the path corkscrews up and to the south, and
down and to the east.

This platform of coral sits at the top of a winding, spiral path along
the phosophorescent walls of this chamber.  Looking over the edge of the
platform provides a view straight down into the Aenea, a fathomless well dug
in the surface of Jh\@ten.  Despite its immense depths, the Aenea is not at
all dark.  Spirit-lights stream in and out of the well by the hundreds,
rising in a column of glittering motes that sparkle with light and then
scatter like fireflies through the air.  Echoing all around is a permanent
low harmonic, preserved by the perfect spiral geometry of the chamber.  The
