large gnarled sapling tree mob_23998~
a twisted sapling~
A large, gnarled sapling rustles noisily here, contained in a black iron cage.
~
A knobbly, thick young tree thrusts from the ground here, bent and
twisted.  Its skin is smooth and flaky like birchbark, but black as
midnight.  A faint sheen coats the bark, as though it were greasy or
otherwise damp.  The ground about the tree\@s base is decidedly darker than
the soil nearby, and is torn up and disturbed.  The sapling\@s whippish
branches seem to tremble, straining and twisting away in all directions
crazily.  Leaves the shape and color of parchment ashes grow thickly along
the branches, rustling loudly at every movement.  Large, tangled roots
thrust their way from the ground like knuckles.  A distinct smell of carrion
lingers unpleasantly around the sapling.

Mother Lajway~
Mother Lajway is here, her eyes gazing past you as if you weren\@t there.
~
Mother Lajway is a wretched-looking, homely old woman.  The word \#witch\#
sums up her general appearance--she could be the stereotypical image of
wicked-witchdom, with her warty long nose and cruel, jutting chin.  Probably
homely in her youth as well, her missing teeth and the splotches of red on
her face do nothing to enhance her appearance.  Her eyes dart around in an
unusual way, and her whole appearance is one that suggests she may be
somewhat unstable.

Serdon~
The phantom of Serdon Shieldmark stands here, looking out over the battlements.
~
The miserable phantom form of a once-proud knight stand before you. 
Serdon is, as the other Nordath knights, a dark and shadowy being retaining
the basic shape of his former mortal self.  Features are impossible to make
out, but Serdon\@s eyes glow with a pale blue radiance that convey a sense of
unspeakable betrayal and loss.

sigh
esay \@says, in his distant-sounding voice,\@ Perhaps you are another party of cursebreakers, like those who were here not long ago?  I heard their screams.
esay \@says sadly\@   Who knows if they learned something of use?  But I can assure you, they didn\@t break the curse.
say Do you know how this valley came to be cursed?  I shall tell you.  It is a story I\@ve repeated more than once for every stone in these fortress walls.
say But what is one more time, when I have an eternity of undeath before me?
esay \@quietly says, looking out across the valley\@  Some two hundred years past, the srryn poured out of their swamp, and crossed the flatlands to the south, making toward Earendam.  
esay \@continues\@ But the srryn horde parted, passing around Earendam completely, and stormed through the grasslands and toward our valley.
esay \@continues\@ We had never battled the srryn--the southern baronies and Earendam bordered their foul swamps and fens.
esay \@continues\@ Our strong walls here were made to defend against other dangers.
esay \@continues\@ A thousand years stood our walls, turning all back who sought to destroy us, even in the dark war.
esay \@shakes his head, as he says \@They slaughtered the bulk of our knights, who went forward to meet them before they could enter the valley.\@
esay \@continues\@ I\@ve heard it said that the grasslands were dark from fire and blood for many a year afterward.
esay \@sighs as he says\@ As this happened, the chief cleric of Nordath--forever be his name cursed--came to those of us who were left behind to defend the walls of Nordath keep, and the folk gathered within.
say He had an object, a holy relic, he called it.  A black stone from the tomb of Converu, or so he claimed.  
say \#Swear on this relic,\# he said.  \#Swear on your soul to defend the walls, and the Gods of light will grant the strength to overcome.\#
esay \@continues, his voice filled with bitterness\@ And so we did.  The srryn were even then at Noin\@s pass, and we were desperate and thoughtless of what such an oath would mean.  We swore our very souls to forever defend the walls.
esay \@continues, looking down at the dry moat\@ And then the srryn reached Nordath.  We held them off at Noin\@s pass for a time, but they filled it with fire.   And they entered the valley, and within a day their fire magic had dried our moat.  
say They began scaling the walls and ramming the gate.  There were so many...
emote remains silent for a moment.
esay \@says, a hand gesturing to this spot on the battlement\@ I stood here.  And even as they came, I heard a bestial roar--from inside the courtyard.  Turning to look, I saw the foulest creature I set eyes on, in life.
say It was a demon of giant man-like form, but with the head of a tusked beast and wings like a drake.  Its eyes burned like the fires that were filling the forest around the keep.
esay \@continues\@ The fiend held the cleric\@s relic.  He held it up for all the knights who defended the walls to see, and laughed.
esay \@continues\@ The demon shouted, \#Men of Nordath, behold your new master!  You\@ve sworn yourselves to me!  You\@ve sworn your souls upon on my very heart!\# He held the heartstone over his chest, and it pulsed a dark crimson.
esay \@laughs humorlessly\@ Then the creature vanished.  And even as we stood stunned, betrayed, the srryn were breaching the gate and scaling the walls.
say The srryn-lord Thensith rose on wings of fire and we battled here, as the gate below was battered to pieces.  I slew him, but it was meaningless.  There were too many, and they were worked into an unnatural blood-frenzy.
say Perhaps they had been in league and given power by the demon.  Or perhaps he had used them unbeknownst.  I don\@t know.  But here the srryn remain with us--compelled unendingly to strike each midnight.
esay \@looks at you closely, and says\@ What I wouldn\@t give, to know how the curse may be lifted.  Or at least, to take that demon\@s heartstone and destroy the damned thing!
esay \@sighs sadly, finishing his story:\@  But here I must stay, here where I stood that day, so long ago.  And here I\@ll remain for as long as a stone remains upon stone in these walls.
emote turns to look back out over the battlements, his flickering blue eyes focused on something beyond sight.

a bearded human singer~
A bearded human minstrel is here, holding a small mandolin.
~
This singer has jet black, bushy hair and a full, thick beard.  His ready
smile reveals straight white teeth.  Though good-natured in appearance, he
also seems sturdy and competent--well-suited to the challenging life of a
wandering minstrel.

the skeleton of Thensith~
The skeleton of Thensith, the once-mighty srryn templar, is here.
~
If the living form of Thensith was comparable to the skeletal form he
currently has, he must have been indeed a sight to inspire fear into the
hearts of his foes.  Along the lower skull, jagged teeth and fangs that
would do a dragon justice create a fierce look.  His scaley hide has
completely disintegrated, and only his bones and antiquated armor are
visible, animated by the unseen curse of undeath.  A skeletal tail rattles
along the ground as he paces around the walls of Nordath.

mpecho The stone begins to flicker, slowly at first, and then more steadily, pulsing with a dark crimson light.

mpzecho The noise continues to increase in loudness, becoming a cacaphony of chaotic sound, and you begin to make out anguished cries of pain, wails and screams of abject misery, and bitter curses.
9
mpzecho Above the valley, and centered above the ruined walls of Nordath, a dark cloud descends, blotting out all light of sun or moon.  
5
mpzecho The cloud of darkness flashes and rumbles, and the screaming, crying voices grow silent.  A sense of dark foreboding permeates the air, as the cloud dissipates.

Agunstad~
The phantom of Father Agunstad, chief cleric of Nordath, is here.
~
The shadowy phantom form of Agunstad, the chief cleric of Nordath in the
days of its fall, stands before you.  Though the features of the dark,
semi-opaque form are somewhat unclear, it is evident that in life, Agunstad
was a large man, quite overweight, with a round head and thick, heavy jowls.

Xichev\@Drologh demon Xichev Drologh bane~
Xichev\@Drologh~
A winged, tusked demon with flashing red eyes returns your gaze.
~
The Bane of Nordath, Xichev\@Drologh, stands nearly twelve feet tall.  His
humanoid form is reminiscent of a nefortu--dark, hairless, with bat-like
wings.  But the resemblence ends there.  Xichev\@Drologh\@s muscled, broad
form is crisscrossed with crimson vein patterns, his eyes red flashes of
flame.  His bull-like horns are tapered to perfect, deadly points, mounted
above a beastly inhuman face.  Tusks dripping a green-tinged saliva jut from
his mouth.  The demon\@s feet and claws end in razor-like claws, and his
sinuous, barbed tail also seems a formidable weapon.

This lone page, seemingly torn from a standard scholar\@s journal, bears
the following text in graceful handwriting:

Evenday, 17th day of Converumir

Today I set out from Earendam with our company.  In total, we are five
scholars and ten warriors.  Two of the scholars are my fellow Salyrans, we
being the tower\@s most skilled adepts in the spells of curse removal.  The
other two scholars, of the Order of the Silver Light, travel with us as well,
likewise skilled in the countering of curses.  The complementary escort
of guards, we have rather resented--as if this band has need of the patrician\@s
protection! We appreciated the irony of the situation though--one of the
spirit scholars, a human named Tov, noted rightly how it is the patrician
who always seems to be in need of protection.

The patrician, I understand, has contacts with Chevellen, a nobly-born
Salyran adept, and asked him to organize a party of cursebreakers.  Why he
chose not to approach the guildmasters, and rely on (highly capable) adepts,
I can\@t say--I\@ve no head for political manuevering.  But we, of course, jumped
at the chance to challenge this curse, even if the circumstances of our
departure are less forthright than we would chose.  Defeating such a curse
would make a case for guildrank advancement, for certain!  

We only know rumors of Nordath--that it lies in a deep forested valley with
a single pass entrance, and that the valley is located in the North Forest,
near its southern end,  almost bordering the grasslands.  Nordath  was, 
as the history texts describe it, once the seat of an important Barony
of the old Earendam republic.  The curse supposedly involves
old spirits and undead, and even demons.

We\@ve heard that the curse has drawn mortals who enter the valley
under its power, and that the bones of those who die rise again, joining the
undead. I, of course, have been taking the standard measures of precaution-
one can never be too careful when dealing with curses.  And my dear Ladiira
was so worried when she heard of the journey. But there has never been
such a company as this, I told her, for challenging ill hexes--we could even lift
the blight off of the Shargob, no doubt.  In fact, I\@d even suggest such a trip to 
Shargob to my companions, once we finish our work here, if it wouldn\@t keep me 
long from my Ladiira\@s side.

A Tall, Narrow Meeting-Hall~
This tall, narrow hall is faced in dark stone.  A floor of polished black
marble, speckled with grey, reflects the room with a dull sheen.  The
ceiling stretches far above your head, interior buttresses of the dark stone
accentuating the height of the walls.  A large, black steel door leads west.
Two tiers of steep, benchlike seats line the northern and southern walls,
overlooking the open, empty space in the middle of the floor.  Above the
benches, many dark tapestries are hung, embroidered in sinister, subtle

A Laboratory Carved Into the Cliff~
This large room has been carved into the stone of the cliff face. 
Burbling and hissing with controlled action, it has been converted into a
rather impressive laboratory.  A massive stone counter squats in the center
of the room, covered with glass and metal instruments in a bewildering
profusion of tubes, burners, and flasks.  Parchment note-pads are laid out
at regular intervals.  Counters along the walls are also lined with shelves
and drawers, many covered with neat labels printed out in a precise
shorthand.  An odd set of shelves stands freely in one rounded corner of the
room.  A large, organic, chimney-like vent curves its way out of the
ceiling, opening over the island.  Shallow stone shelves carved into the
wall near the ceiling are planted with large, wide mushrooms which glow with
unnaturally bright light, illuminating the room.  Stone doorways lead east
and west.

E
counter counters~
Which counter would you like to look at?  There is a curved counter which
follows the curvature of the walls, or a center island in the middle of the
room.  
~
E
stone center island~
A large island positioned in the center of the room serves as an alchemic
workbench.  The sides and top are made of unnaturally large slabs of a hard,
clear glassine material which glows with some enchanted light.  The top is
covered with a wide array of equipment.  A tall wooden stool teeters at one
end of the island, where the surface is covered with scraps of parchment and
notebooks, all inundated with indecipherable scribbles.  Laid out in precise
ranks and files across the rest of the workbench are countless alchemical
paraphenalia - burners, boilers, beakers, flasks, stills, retorts, and many
more devices of an unknown purpose whirl away in a dazzling array of glass
and metal.  A large, organic, chimney-like vent curves its way out of the
ceiling, opening over the island.  
~
E
large organic chimney chimney-like vent up ceiling~
This large vent is crafted or grown from some woody, fibrous material. 
Amorphous and organic, it twists its way out of the stone ceiling and bells
out like a trumpet, the opening several feet above the central island
workbench.  A natural draft seems to be drawn up through it, pulling any
noxious or dangerous fumes from the workspace.  
~
E
curved~
Spread out across the surface of the bench are a wide variety of glass
pipettes, beakers, pestles and other containers, most of which contain
unidentifiable liquids and powders in various states of processing.  One
square section of the tabletop is inexplicably on fire, several flasks of
simmering fluid resting on it.  A fine mist settles around some vials
resting on another section made of ice.  Several other pieces of equipment
are distributed across the countertop, their applications obscure to anyone
without training, but it is clear that they are used heavily.  A bank of
many drawers is built into the base of the counter.  
~
E
shelf shelves~
Which shelves would you like to look at?  There is an odd set of spiral
shelves against the north wall, and a series of shallow stone shelves around
the ceiling.  
~
E
shallow mushroom mushrooms~
Shallow shelves have been carved out of the wall near the ceiling, filled
with thick black loam.  Large, wide-capped mushrooms sprout profusely from
these planters, glowing far brighter than seems natural in several shades of
pale blue and green.  
~
E
odd set spiral north northern~
This set of spindly wooden shelves is crafted in the manner of a small
spiral staircase.  Freestanding, it stretches from the floor to the ceiling.
Several small trinkets and curios of travel have been set out in display. 
Of note are a small glittering stone, a wire-mounted skeleton, a leather
figurine, and a dish of black sand.  
~
E
glittering~
This small stone glitters and sparkles with inner light.  The piece of
pyrite seems to have no inherent value other than as a pretty trinket.  
~
E
wire wire-mounted skeleton shura~
A smallish skeleton the size of a human infant has been mounted and bound
together with stiff wire.  Appearing to be from a shura of Qilarn forest,
the different bones are neatly labelled and marked.  
~
E
leather figurine~
This small figurine is crafted from stiff curls of raw leather.  Vaguely
kankoran in nature, it seems to have no inherent value other than a souvenir
of travel.  
~
E
dish black sand~
This small dish of black sand constantly stirs and shifts, moved by some
unseen force.  No discernible pattern is evident and its movements, and
further scrutiny reveals nothing important about it.  
~
E
drawer drawers~
These drawers, fashioned from dark, varnished wood, are set into the
stone counter.  Roughly four inches tall and a foot wide, there are seven
drawers here.  You may open DRAWER1, DRAWER2, etc.

A Ravine Entrance~
The thick forest undergrowth and evergreens give way to a low, grassy
depression, which narrows and descends until forming a shallow ravine.  The
forest trail that leads northward ends at the mouth of the ravine, at the
side of a tiny stream which flows southward.  The source of the stream, a
large burbling spring surrounded by clumps of cattails, provides water for
much of the fauna in this part of the forest.  A variety of animal tracks
are captured in the patch of mud that surrounds the spring.

The sparse vegetation along the ravine\@s base is composed mainly of dried

The Entrance to Nordath Valley~
You are at the entrance to a small, secluded valley which stretches out
towards the east.  The valley would seem picaresque to most, with green
conifers and various broad-leafed trees forming a patched canopy above the
younger trees, thick bushes, and the grassy floor.  The sloped hills that
form the valley are so steeply inclined that climbing them would be nigh
impossible, yet they do descend lower at this point than elsewhere, and a
broad ravine splits the slope in two to the west.  The intermittent rustling
of leaves is the only sound in this place, which should normally be full of

The Valley of Nordath~
This side of the valley is marked by intermittent stands of alder and
spruce.  Also, wild shrubs and tangled bayberry hedges make the area a bit
of a maze to navigate.  The silent sylvan forest would seem peaceful and
serene to most, if it were not for the very noticeable, unnatural quiet that
hangs in the air.  It is as if the animals that would normally dwell in such
a place have all fled or been spirited away.  Directly to the west and
north, steeply-sloped green hills form part of the valley basin, and distant
in the southeast, looming over the treetops, stand the ruins of a large
fortress.

The ground rises slightly in this part of the forest to form a low
hillock, clear of trees.  Atop the hillock, the valley rim is visible in all

The forest in this part of the valley is thick with small pines and

area.  The decaying trunks of two large trees lie here, the end of one
crossed atop the other.  They are spotted with an ochre-yellow lichen.  The

This small cave\@s entrance is a narrow opening to the north, hidden by a
thick screen of brambles.  The soot-darkened stone of the walls has been
shaped and smoothed, and holds a variety of pegs, shelves, and
stretched-out, drying animal hides.  The small fire pit near the entrance

A Steep Slope~
You are on the side of a steep slope, which descends to the east into a

as a path.  Amid the silent trees, occasional outcroppings of dark rock
provide more solid footing than the wild grass that covers most of the slope
surface.  Standing out from the green undergrowth are a few white heal-alls,

To the north, the forest thins and the ground begins to slope downward,
but at this point the trees end at the edge of a dried-out moat which
separates the forested valley floor from the large ruins to the south. 
Though the fortress across the moat is clearly in a state of disrepair, and

and hide most of the inner keep from view.  The few crumbling towers that

You are in an old, dried-out moat that rings a corner of the crumbling
ruins of a once-great fortress.  High above, the trees and forest growth of
Nordath valley are visible on the northern and western sides of the moat. 
Limbs extend out over the moat, and roots and vines creep down the sides,
but none close enough or sturdy enough to be of use for attempting to climb
up.  To the southeast, a corner of the still-standing outer wall of the

with large, bushy shrubs and small flowering plants.  Willows in small
stands are intermixed with spiked cattails, and the few trees there are have
large deposits of moss and lichen.  A single wild rosebush adds a splash of
vibrant red to the forest greens and muted browns of the other foliage.

A Dark Dell~
The trees draw closely about this end of the small dell, creating an
atmosphere most would find stuffy and oppressing.  The smell of the area is
heavy with the scent of decaying leaves.  The way the trees have grown thick
and clustered together, evenly spreading their limbs and leaves to block
nearly any view of the open sky, it seems as if they had something to hide. 
There is one small break in the trees, however, a small patch of clearing
where an old moss-covered well stands.  A small footpath runs from the side
of the well to disappear southward, into the foliage.

Near a Small Hut~
This side of the small, secluded hollow is populated by tall trees and
covered in turf, as is the rest of the dell.  A few pale orchis blossoms
stand out above the thick grass, looking like pearls set in green velvet.  A
man-made structure, an old windowless shack, stands to the east.  Covered in
peeling wooden shingles, the shack would seem abandoned if not for a
well-worn footpath, clear of new growth, which begins at the doorway of the
shack and turns northward through the trees.

North of the Moat~
The trees end here at the edge of a dried-out moat which separates the
forested valley floor from the large ruins to the south.  Though the
fortress across the moat is clearly in a state of disrepair, and has been
long abandoned, the thick outer walls still remain mostly intact, and hide
most of the inner keep from view.  The few crumbling towers that peak up
over the battlement look like jagged brown teeth.

the moat are steep and unscalable, despite their roughness and the many
clinging plants and vines that grow on them.  The moat floor is so

The Valley of Nordath~
This side of the valley is marked by intermittent stands of tall trees,
with wild shrubs and tangled bayberry hedges making the area between the
stands of trees difficult to navigate.  The forest would seem peaceful and
serene, if it were not for the unnatural quiet that hangs in the air.  It is
as if the animals that would normally dwell in such a place have all fled or
been spirited away.  Directly to the east and north, steeply-sloped green
hills form part of the valley basin, and distant in the southwest, looming
over the treetops, stand the ruins of a large fortress.

Green sloped hills are visible, though hazy in the distance, on all sides of

floor, the thick foliage showing no evidence of civilization--or any life
whatsoever.  A square opening in the floor of the battlement was once the

Nordath\@s Crumbling Battlements~
The battlements of Nordath stand high above the inner courtyard, to your
east, and the dried-out moat that rings the ancient ruins, to the west. 
Green sloped hills are visible, though hazy in the distance, on all sides of
the valley.  Unusually quiet, an old hardwood forest carpets the valley
floor, the thick foliage showing no evidence of civilization--or any life
whatsoever.  A square opening in the floor of the battlement was once the
entrance of a stairwell shaft--but the stairs have long since broken away,
leaving a straight drop to the bottom of the shaft.

Nordath\@s Crumbling Battlements~
Hazy in the distance, steep slopes splotched a rich brown and deep green
descend to form the enclosed valley of Nordath.  The green of the slopes
thickens on the lower half, and completely swallows the valley floor:
massive hardwoods, tall evergreens, and a profusion of shrubs and lesser
plants are broken only by the ring of the moat at your feet.  Here on the
battlements of the crumbling ruin, you can also see down in the inner court
of Nordath, where the flora also has invaded, and what remains of the keep,

disrepair, but still stand despite time and wear, ringing the long-abandoned

A Shattered Gatehouse~
This gatehouse remains, after centuries, the sole open access to the
inner court of Nordath.  It is more of a hole in the wall than a protective
gatehouse now--the outer walls of Nordath remain mostly intact, and here
form a rough arch over you.  Visible to the east is the overgrown inner
courtyard and the keep.  At your feet, the years of debris and weeds are
unable to hide completely the rusting remains of a massive steel barbican,
half-buried in the soil.  The twisted and punctured metal of the barbican is
a silent testament to Nordath\@s fall.

rotting wooden pillars that once created a firm framework for the structure
now lean against the battlement wall, and the stalls now hold only chunks of
grey and brown stone, fallen from the battlement wall, and the plants that

The Ruins of a Barrack~
The roof of the ruined barrack has long since decayed away, though a few
broken timbers still partially stretch across the thick walls.  The walls
are formed of the same mortared gray and brown stone as the fortress walls,
and are relatively whole.  Some vegetation and debris litter the floor, but
not as much as elsewhere throughout the ruins.  A massive iron door, brown
with flaking rust, is set in the northern wall.  To the east, a thin
dividing wall still separates the two main rooms of the barrack, but the
door in its center is completely ruined, barely hanging from one hinge.

The Rubble of an Old Stable~
Here along the northern edge of the battlement wall, there are thin,
waist-high partitions which once served as stalls in the Nordath stables. 
The rotting timbers of the long-decayed structure still stand, now leaning
over at odd angles, some with their tops sunk into the crumbling battlement
walls above.  A yellow rosebush among the other plants creeping up through
the debris adds a splash of color to the otherwise drab view.

The inner courtyard of Nordath is overgrown with pale flowering plants,

Here within the walls of Nordath, the forest is slowly making its move to

The Ruins of a Barrack~
You stand in a ruined stone room, evidently a barrack from the few
bunk-like stone slabs that stretch out from the walls.  The roof has
decayed, allowing for a generous amount of wind-blown dirt to accumulate in
the room, and a few small plants and weeds to grow among the debris.  A
massive iron door, brown with rust, is set in the east wall, and the west
wall is a thinner separating wall which divides the barrack into two main
rooms.  The open doorway in the west wall reveals a room much like this one

You stand in the center of the ancient fortress of Nordath, the ruins and
decay of hundreds of years all around you.  The fortress walls, still
intact, rise in all directions, save for an opening far to the west.  To the
east the once-sturdy keep now lies in ruin, and though portions of it still
rise up two to three stories high, the gaps and cracks in the walls showing how
time finishes what humankind begins.  At your feet is a pit, which is lined

You stand in what would have once been the spacious main hall of Nordath
keep.  The hall is now under the open sky--only a few broken supporting
timbers jutting from the walls mar the view above.  The collapse of a second
floor of the keep would give reason for the large amount of stone debris
here.  Marble columns set in the eastern wall--the only wall not split with
cracks--bear weathered carvings.  The ancient symbol of Nordath, the
blue-winged hawk clutching crossed spears, is prominent on many of them.  In
one corner of the room, a large mound raises higher than the other wreckage
and debris in the hall.  Human bones are visible among the dirt and weeds
that partially cover the pile.  To the west stands the wide entrance to the
hall.  Covered passageways which have remained relatively intact open up in
the northern and southern walls, and a staircase set among the carved
columns in the eastern wall leads upward.

A Room Within the Ruined Keep~
This room is open to the sky, as the ceiling and second floor above have
long since fallen in, littering the ground with shattered stone.  There is a
small hole in the western wall that now serves as a tiny window with a view
of the fortress\@s overgrown courtyard.  The walls are rough, pocked from the
many places where stone blocks have crumbled away or fallen out of the
crumbling, chalk-white mortar.  A small doorway opens up into a passageway
in the western wall.

The Kitchen Cellar~
Thick stone pillars in this dank cellar support the floor above, and have
remained intact.  Aside from some cluttered debris near the stairway, and a
very thick layer of pale, chalky dust, the room has been preserved much as
it was during the time when the fortress was inhabited by the living.  The
rusting rims and broken wooden slats from several barrels are heaped in one
end of the room, and at the other end, a sturdy wooden shelf holds a few
assorted kitchen implements, broken glassware, and cobwebs.

Nordath\@s Crumbling Battlements~
The battlements along the outer walls of Nordath are in a state of severe
disrepair, but still stand despite time and wear, ringing the long-abandoned
inner court and keep.  The thick walls are formed of large grey and brown
stone blocks in various stages of erosion and breakage.  From the
battlements, the deep dry moat and lush forest beyond are visible, as are
the distant green slopes that form Nordath valley.  The battlements here run

Clinging plants and tenacious grasses sprout up from cracks and bloom in
deposits of dusty soil, along the battlement wall.  Vines creep up the
walls, from both sides--the inner courtyard of Nordath keep, and the outer

The stone stairway rises up from the great hall of Nordath below.  The

from the staircase to rooms on the second floor have, along with the rooms,
long since fallen in.  Many of the steps on the stairway are completely worn

This room long ago served the kitchen of Nordath, as evident from the
several semi-intact brick ovens that line the western wall of the room. 
Rusted iron cauldrons and other cooking implements are scattered about,
half-buried in the accumulated dust from hundreds of years and the plant
growth that has sprung up from it.  An assortment of debris from the
caved-in ceiling and rooms it once supported is also strewn about.  The

This small hallway is layered in dust and broken stone.  The timbers

You stand at the top of a flight of stairs which connects the floor of
Nordath keep, its main hall clearly visible below, with the battlements of
the outer fortress walls.  The stairs are steep and in a state of severe
disrepair, as are the battlements.  Clumps of weeds and small, leafy plants
have sprouted among the deposits of soil along the top of the wall, and many
stones have fallen free, creating a hazardous purchase.  To the east, a dry

across the hallway, and the massive slate tiles they support remains intact.
A thick layer of dust and some shattered stone fallen from the walls litters
the ground.  A doorway to the east is clear of debris, though it looks like

A Ruined Chapel~
This rubble-filled chamber is open to the sky; the mostly-intact walls
rise up, breaking into a jagged line at about the half-way point of what was
once the second floor of the keep.  Despite the ruin and decay, it is
evident that the room served as the fortress chapel.  Chipped stone benches
are placed in now-uneven rows in the center of the room, and a large stone
altar near the south wall is covered in a layer of wind-blown soil, enough
to support a blooming skunkweed bush which adds a strong musky odor to the
air.  Several stone statues representing the divine beings of goodness are
placed at intervals around the room, though some of them lie fallen or
shattered.  All of the remaining statues bear evidence of a long-ago,
purposeful disfiguration.

You are flying over an old moat, to the side of a ruined keep wall.  The
wall is slowly crumbling away, but remains mostly solid due its unusual
thickness and solid construction.  The brown and grey boulders that have
formed the outer face of the wall have in many places fallen out, and are
strewn about the dried moat below.  It is a dangerous drop down to the

The Valley of Nordath~
Massive oaks and other large hardwoods surround you, there gnarled limbs
and roots making this stretch of the forest valley difficult to traverse. 
The canopy of leaves overhead is so thick that little light penetrates down

leaves.  It seems like the trees thin slightly to the west, and the

Above the Gatehouse~
The 30-foot-thick battlements are worn with age but still secure enough
to walk upon.  In some areas pits and cracks make walking the battlements no
easy effort.  They afford, though, an excellent view of the valley of
Nordath.  The lush verdant canopy of forest extends all the way to the steep
valley walls, and from this vantage point it seems as if you are afloat in a
sea of green.  Beyond the battlement, a deep moat marks the dividing line of
forest and stronghold ruins, even though grass, bushes, and slender trees
have begun to invade the courtyard within the walls.  Far to the west, a
fissure in the valley wall marks the ravine which provides the primary
access to the valley.

A Dark, Orderly Garden~
This clearing in the dense woods is surrounded by a high wall of
featureless dark stone.  Roughly square, it seems to center on the large
cage which stands in the center.  A small path of black gravel encircles it,
which is in turn bordered by a ring of large, thorny shrubs.  The garden is
wild and the plants closest the cage seem almost to shudder from time to
time.  Many more different types of plants forming snarled, vague shapes
among the paths.  A hanging carpet of thick, heavy creeper vines climb the
wall and twist their way into the surrounding trees.  A small block of onyx
sits against the southeastern wall.  The entire clearing is subsumed with an
oppressive gloom - the garden seems filled with deep shadows, and the air
within seems almost hazy.  The trees around the outside lean inwards
somewhat, enclosing the garden in even further.  To the east, the wall stops
at a steep stone cliff-face, where a large, rectangular doorway has been
carved.  To the west, a gap in the wall leads out through a briar hedge.

high wall~
This stone wall is built from unshaped blocks of stone, well-fitted
together with a master mason\@s eye.  Very little mortar is required to hold
the stones together, and the wall seems quite sturdy and thick.  Roughly ten
feet in height, the wall executes a square with corners at each of the
cardinal compass points.  Openings in the eastern and western points lead
out of the garden, the wall actually built into the cliff face to the east.

pattern interspersed with patches of thick moss and paths of dark gravel. 
All specimens in the garden seem to be selected from species which are
particularly hardy, poisonous, or prolific.  Many types of thorned, choking,
or woody vegetation can be seen.

E
hanging carpet creeper vine vines~
This thick mass of creeper vines borders the garden on the northern and
southern walls.  Heavy and choking, the vines writhe and tangle amongst
themselves, stifling out any competing vegetation.  They surge over the tops
of the wall and climb into the trees.  Small, hard fruits of a smooth brown
can be seen growing at some of the joints and forks in the mass, the little
nodes seemingly protected by the growth of the plant.

D1
A large, rectangular doorway has been roughly hewn into the steep cliff
face.  The wall runs into and out of the natural stone a few feet to either
side of the opening.
