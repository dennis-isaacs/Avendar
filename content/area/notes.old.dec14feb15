Greetings, My Lady Pfusch,

Forgive me if my manners seem lacking in addressing you.  I am unfamiliar
with the proper....  Etiquette when contacting one of Divine station, such
as yourself.  I am humbly aware of my shortcomings, and hope that they do
not bring me disfavor.  But I digress.  This message is concerning such
matters as you requested I bring to light when they occur.  Several tasks
have you set forth for me to complete, of the first, I was to locate five
sponsors of good heart to vouch for me that my path is yet true, and my
intentions real.  I have found but one thus far, willing to do so.  Of the
second task, which you asked of me to follow the teachings of the Champions,
I have an encounter which may bring to light my willingness to sacrifice all
for the cause of the Light.  It was brought to my attention by a soldier
named Sirical, that several dark hearted souls were laying waste to the
Griffin\@s aerie.  Myself and Sirical joined together to end the slaughter
taking place.  Though outnumbered two to one, we managed to end the life of
one of these wretched souls, at the cost of my own life.  More importantly,
we managed to delay their slayings of the nobel Griffins.  During the course
of my recovery, Sirical managed to Lead another of these foes to her death. 
Once I was well again, we again encountered this hellspawned party, and once
more I fell to their blades.  Yet for a time we drove them away from the
Aerie, and once I had recovered a final time, we joined with two others, and
finally forced our enemies to flee from the Griffin\@s lair entirely.  

Perhaps you wonder why I did this?  Why I, a Shuddeni, would fight for the
Griffins.  I do so because....  I care.  I care that these noble creatures,
not simple beasts, are not meant to be slaughtered like so much cattle.  The
same can be said of any sentient race.  I have forsaken the killing of
innocents, within and without the cities.  I shall protect them, with my
life if need be, for many are those who cannot protect themselves...  And I
do so, in your name.  


Your humblest servant,

Ahzagthoth

Divine Goddess,

It was some years ago that I first heard of our friend Ahzagthoth, and his
quest to be transformed from the shackled path of his people to a way more
pleasing to the Light.  I did not meet with him directly at the time, but I
met with the templar mage Shalerin, who was assigned by Lord Deshmin to
watch over the actions of Ahzagthoth.  Since the first mention of his name I
have been graced with good feelings about him.  Though my brothers of Light
had doubts about his dedication, I myself was ecstatic with joy at the very
thought that a shuddeni _might_ seek such a transformation.  After meeting
with Shalerin, and after a very inspiration conversation with a young woman
in the establishment \#Nymph\@s Tears,\# I set myself firmly on the path of
aiding Ahzagthoth in his quest any way I could.  

So you see, Goddess, it is my pleasure to send word of my support and my
observance of Ahzagthoth\@s dedication to transgression toward a free spirit.


Thank you.

Subject A request for boon, and an idea for consideration~
Text
Lords Iandir and Rveyelhi,

I have conceived over this last decade an idea I feel is ready to present to
both of You.  

I wish to construct a great monument to the Law in a public place, or even
places.  This monument, in my vision a great arch of black-wrought iron,
would be surmounted by spikes.  Atop the spikes would be mounted the skulls
of criminals brought to justice, with plaques below describing their crimes
against Order and Law for all to see and learn from.  Only Guardians could
mount skulls, and pen the plaques far similar to the marking reports that we
currently use.  The skulls would remain for a reasonable length of time, for
example, perhaps a year and a day.  

I believe I have the funds required to construct the physical manifestation
of the monument, if You are both willing to empower it to do as specified,
so that no one but Guardians could mount skulls and so forth.  

Secondly, to Lord Rveyelhi I request this boon: Return me, if you can, to a
more youthful state.  My body has begun the slow process of failing me, and
the reduction in my abilities is felt most keenly.  Even a single decade
would be most appreciated, my Lord.  

Ever your humble Guardian and servant,

Kiiran Merithos, Senior Guardian and Soldier of the Crown

Hi Iandir,

Here is my design for the Shrine:

An alcove built into the south wall of the Gaald library opens to reveal a
luminescent shrine.  The tall glass pillars around you have been molded into
great hourglasses.  Inside of them, sand endlessly trickles down though the
narrow neck from the upper to lower chamber, though the later is hardly
full.  These magical pillars hold up a ceiling made from the clearest glass,
allowing you to see the sky above.  The floor you stand on depicts a
holographic map of Avendar; the details of which are marvelously in-depth
and intricate.  Set in the center of the shrine is an altar of gray marble,
upon which rests a large opened book with a quill resting in the seam.  A
tranquil silence permeates the room, allowing one to hear their inner most
thoughts.  

Thanks again for all your hard work and time.  I really appreciate it.  

Sincerely,

Dyrast

Text
Obfuscation is currently bugged.  It allows only one cast of obfuscation
per person.  However, it does not stop further casts from affecting one of
two targets.  

In other words, if I were to cast obfuscation on myself with Jolinn as my
target, it will hide Jolinn from my sight, as well as hide me from Jolinn\@s
sight.  However, since I am already affected by obfuscation, no further
spells will work on me.  Thus, I cast obfuscation on myself with Iandir as
my target.  I am blocked from Iandir\@s view, because he was not affected by
obfuscation beforehand.  However, he is not hidden from my view, because I
already have an obfuscation in effect.

Subject The Scythe of Oblivion~
Text
Short desc- The Scythe of Oblivion

Long desc - 

A scythe carved entirely from bone, scrawled with eldritch runes to be swung
as easily with one hand as with two.  It is a ghastlylooking weapon, and
eminates a sense of pure, unrelenting hatred.  



History - I created the Scythe with Guhl, a human Ranger.  The scythe was
intented to be a sentient weapon whose overwhelming desire was to destroy
fire templars/scholars.  

The background begins with the war of Fire.  During that time, the armies of
fire were burning and systematically destroying the forests of Avendar.  In
order to combat the destruction of all they held dear, the Druids of that
time summoned a mighty dragon to protect the last remnants of their refuge. 
The dragon embodied nature\@s fury.  

The summoning was successful, and the dragon assisted in aiding the
beleagured guardians of the forest.  The cost was great though, for the
dragon fell to the mightiest of Fire templar\@s and Scholars.  

With the emergence of the water templars and scholars though, the armies of
fire were finally defeated and the forests saved.  THe anger of the
surviving Druids and rangers was considerable and bordered on madness.  A
legendary Ranger general was chosen to sacrifice himself so that the Druids
might infuse his spirit into a weapon created from the jawbone of the fallen
dragon.  This weapon would be a force of power against future fire templar\@s
and scholars.  The spirit of the ranger would overwhelm any who took hold of
the Scythe and bend their will to it\@s will.  Death to all who wielded the
power of fire for reckless destruction.  And so the Scythe has passed the
years, finding it\@s way into the hands of one person to another.  In some
cases, the owner was weak of mind and easily controlled.  Sometimes their
strength held off it\@s call and they harnessed it\@s power for their own
means.  Yet one thing is certain, the call may be ignored for a time, but
eventually the spirit would take over, and the hunt would begin anew.  

So, that was basically the idea behind the scythe.  Of course, I planned on
it being only wieldable by Guhl, but umm, that kinda didn\@t work out.

- Within the fortress, in the Room of the Scales you can {Wlook pedestals{x

- At the Apex of the Fortress, you have a good view of the Brintor foothills
  and can {Wlook out{x of the window to view approaching forces.

- You can store some of your extra gear and items in the storeroom which
  Kanoher guards. However, bring a balanced approach to your use of the room.
  Do not  fill the storeroom with useless junk or horde valuables out of 
  greed.
  
- Should the gate be destroyed, a work force will be sent for, and the gate
  eventually be repaired. You may need to protect the workers repairing the
  gate if there are still enemies about.
  
- Lastly, be certain to visit me, Irionne, in the chapel so that I can add
  you to the duty roster.

May Enirra strengthen you in your duties to uphold her will.

Kestrel asked me to spam you guys with notes on the Golden Flames, so here I go.

I love Heart of the Inferno.  I will always love skills like Heart and devotion that offer
rewards for high-level play.  Skills like these do wonders to keep me interested once I hit hero.

Now, moving on to insights.  I think that insights are my biggest complaint with this path so far.
The main problem is that I don\@t have any information on what insights are or what they do.  I 
-think- that they improve the power of specific rites.  I -think- that they\@re required to even complete 
some rites.  I\@m having a hard time mapping insights to rites and power gains.  Is it two insights
per rite?  Personally, I\@d like to see two (maybe three) things improved with insights:

1) Just some basic explanation in the starter literature on what insights are and why I want them.
2) A list of insights I\@ve acquired, e.g. \#You\@ve looked into Oajma\@s flame,\# \#You\@ve stood in the Inferno,\#
\#You\@ve read Ksathan\@s Scroll of Embers,\# \#You\@ve stared into the flame dragon\@s ruby.\#
3) This one\@s iffy as it may remove too much of the unknowns.  If you guys think it\@s OK, it\@d be
really nice to have something like, \#You\@ve gained some insight into the Wreath of Flame,\# 
\#You\@ve perfected the Essence of the Inferno.\#

As for the rites (that I\@ve figured out):
(the Essence of the Inferno) - Seems to be about 2-damage words of damage reduction.  I\@ve 
seen one retaliation across five or six pyre lifetimes.  Does it stop working post-retaliation
like chillfire shield does?  If not, then the retaliation doesn\@t really happen enough to be
interesting.  Definitely in my top two.
(the Brimstone Conduit) - I can cast it.  I just don\@t know what it does.
(the Fireflies) - Does it affect the whole area?  If not, it should.  If so, ignore this comment.
(the Summoning of the Salamander) - Useful for when you need a fire-resistant tank.  
Damage is decent.  I think it\@s balanced.  I summon it when I need that extra oomph 
but it\@s too expensive to keep as a perma-charmie like a water / earth elemental.
(the Hearthglow) - Does this just glow + warm + repair the item?  I haven\@t found much use for 
it yet.  I did notice that it\@s kind of hard to find fur (most things, even the sleeping furs, are actually hide).
(the Wreath of Flames) - This is pretty cool.  Really useful in big groups with warriors and templars.
Haven\@t tried sacrificing a Heart to it yet.  This is probably PAFO, but will sacrificing a Heart grant
me insight or merely boost the power of the Wreath for that casting?  Do I simply sacrifice it after
the oil + gold + metal?
(the Fury of Ada\@Chemta\@Boghor) - Does this just spawn elementals and blaze the room?  If so, I 
don\@t think it\@s going to be that useful as-is.  Maybe if it was instantaneous rather than permanent.
Or gave you a droppable, indestructible item that would have the same effect as long as this rite was active.
(the Realm of Bayyal) - Awesome.  Top two.
(the Steelscald) - While it\@s only useful in PK, it seems VERY useful in PK.
(the Ward of Brimstone) - Pretty much just a less flexible version of the Flameheart / Raging Inferno spell, right?

Subject Report on Nleora S\@ath Raiding the Tower of Aramril~
Text
<a large faceted crystal, shining with mystic energy, is
included as a sacrifice>

Nleora S\@ath Raids the Tower of Aramril

On Thelansday, 1st day of Valectis, I observed as Nleora began
her second raid on the Tower of Aramril.  Her first order of
business was to clear out any templar guards in the immediate
vicinity of the Dome.  To the east lies a library, housing a
nonviolent scholar.  To the west lies a council hall, guarded
by a templar.  The templar in the watchtower may be ignored, as
the stairwell is barred by a door.

Some form of flight and a bite of hellebore are recommended as
preparation for battling Aranthas.  Nleora simply used two forms
against Aranthas: a pinpoint strike while assuming the wasp to
induce bleeding and calculated strikes while assuming the reed
to wear him down.  In battle, Aranthas will attempt to kick,
bash, and blast streams of ice at his assailant.  He will also
drain the warmth from their weapons and flood the room with
water.

All in all, Aranthas struck Nleora with seventy-two blows of
divine power, thirty-four kicks, twenty-four bashes, and ten
blasts of ice.  More bashes would have likely landed, though
Aranthas was unable to fight effectively in the midst of his
own floods.  In return, it took Nleora five-hundred eighty-eight
blows across sixteen attempts to bring down the son of Anirim.

She freed three Stones, Nelenna\@s sleeves, some of Deremegon\@s
armor, and a ch\@lonin dagger from the vault.  The dagger she
brought to sacrifice to Lilune - unfortunately, I was turned
away prior to the sacrifice.

Psychologically, challenging the son of Anirim fits into her
profile.  Her main goal in life has been to acquire expertise
in all existing weapons.  This task, while impossible for the
typical swordmaster, clearly may be achieved through divine
intervention.  Lilune has already taught her the use of the axe
so there is some precedence.  In order to please Lilune, she
must please her patroness - something that seems to require her
to seek ever larger challenges.  Aranthas has fallen - I predict
it\@s a matter of weeks until she decides on her next challenge.
The Halls of Law, perhaps?  No challenge in raiding a House
that holds no risk of reprisal, after all.

Edit - Nleora will likely NOT raid the Halls.

THE ESSENCE OF THE INFERNO

In order for the scholar of the Golden Flames to cloak himself
in the Essence of the Inferno, he must walk the path between the
pyre.  Only after the scholar views that fiery path will the
Essence settle about him, its fury shielding him against those
that would do him harm.

Beware, those that would harm one so enshrouded!  The Inferno
does not look kindly upon those who aggress against its heralds.
Swords and axes do little to threaten the flames - no, they
merely fan the unextinguishable.  Many have exceeded the
Inferno\@s tolerance - their charred remains offer mute testimony
to the fury of Its fiery retribution.

The recipe is straightforward.  Into a pyre of blue, incinerate:
- That which is made of smoke*
- That which sheds a guiding light**
- That which blocks the fiercest blow***

* Vials of liquid smoke may be purchased from Dyurjan, the
Yithoul Inferno Master.
** Torches may be purchased for a pittance from the general
store in Var Bandor.
*** Tempered steel body shields may be purchased from the Var
Bandor armorer.

Subject Insights into the Kzaya-Ha Canyon~
Text
INSIGHTS INTO THE KZAYA-HA CANYON

The Kzaya-Ha may very well possess the largest, and most
advanced, gathering of fire scholars in the lands.  While we
scholars are desirious of their knowledge, it would be foolhardy
to assume that the nefortu would willingly give up their
secrets.

Do not be fooled by the adolescent nefortu at the entrance,
playing meanspirited games with their flame lizards.  The real
defenders, templar and scholar, lie deeper within the caves.  A
well-prepared scholar will have the following:
- A staff of mist, a staff of ice, or jaws of the same
- Runed staves of the Yithoul elders
- Dust of diamond, dust of sapphire
- Understanding of the Salamander
- Walked the path of the Inferno
- A healthy dose of fortitude
- A strong arm, a strong mind
- Luck

The caverns of the Pillar and the Dedicant lie far to the
southeast.  Do not be distracted by the branches - the scholar
who unwaveringly follows the righthand wall will eventually make
it to his destination.  Before entering, summon the Salamander
from a pyre of pure white.  Repurpose the pyre, calling forth an
ever-scalding shield from one of blue.  Wreath yourself in
scorching flames, open a connection to the plane of fire, and
quaff a flight draught, if available.  Do not summon wings of
flame!  The price demanded slows progress to a crawl within the
tunnels.

Resist the urge to strike back when faced with a templar of the
Kzaya-Ha - each and every one stands in a ward of flame!
Instead, allow the Salamander the first strike, for wards of
flame do little to harm a lizard of the same.  If the templar
wields spear, flail, or whip, take the fore with staff in hand.
If the templar is unarmed, allow the Salamander to take the fore
in your place - it pays no heed to the templar\@s fiery strikes.

The scholars are both more dangerous and more unpredictable than
the templars.  Maintain your position behind the Salamander at
all costs!  The scholars will fill the room with fireballs,
direct beams of fire, and most importantly, attempt to
disintegrate their foes.  While the Salamander is unfazed by
both the scholar\@s fiery blows and fiery spells, one errant
disintegrating beam can melt through armor and flesh, offering a
quick and painful end to the expedition.

Once at the mouth of the caverns, order the Salamander through
first, as the entryway is too small to fit two abreast.  Ignore
the glow cast by the runes - it is little more than an
inconvenience.  The pile to the south holds some trinkets and
treasures.  The hole to the west contains the Dedicant.  The
pillar to the southwest summons him forth.  Order the Salamander
into the pillar, for being consumed by flames makes the
following battle rather inconvenient.  Make sure that all
benedictions from the prior paragraphs, as well as the cloaks
provided by the Yithoul staves, are active prior to this action.

The Dedicant will rise from his dwelling hole and charge the
pillar.  A reanimated, scorched, husk of a nefortu, the Dedicant
will strike fast, easily matching the speed of a living flame.
In addition, he will both bash and trip his opponents, all the
while burning them with beams of fire.  Once again, the optimal
strategy is to keep the Salamander in the fore.  All the extra
precautions are suggested (required), to absorb any errant blows
while repositioning yourself behind the Salamander.  Wield a
frosted weapon, for fire strikes the Dedicant with far lessened
force.

The scholar who survives the battle and lands the killing blow
(note: unconfirmed) will be rewarded with the Kzaya-Ha\@s
collective insight on the Brimstone Conduit.

Subject How Nleora S\@ath Sought the Moon~
Text
HOW NLEORA S\@ATH SOUGHT THE MOON

My observation of Nleora S\@ath, swordmistress and former dancer
from Ashta Harrud, began during a series of passes (for some
youngling\@s benefit) at Ghaunda.  It was a typical night sky -
Rhos waned crescent (note: I was mistaken at the time.  I
mistakingly confused the Blood Witches with ALL followers of the
Moon, and thus, only noted Rhos\@s phase at the time).  After
watching me incinerate one of Dyurjan\@s bloodstones in my Pyre,
Nleora requested to offer up to Lilune.  I, of course, granted
her request.  How often does a civilized scholar get to watch a
sacrifice to the Muse?  In response, Lunus gleamed down upon
Nleora, bathing her in a flickering light.  Her eyes began to
glow in counterbeat, flickering a deep red, mirroring the angry
red moon above.

The Enchantress\@s whispers must have reached Nleora\@s ears,
then, as she soon broke formation to head to the sanctuary
on Mt. Enrien.  There, above where the pegasi and the griffin
dwell, she introduced me to the Pool where Lilune had first
spoken to her.  It was here, one month earlier, that Lilune had
brought her to teach her the axe, setting her on the path to
becoming not just a swordmaster, but a weaponmaster.  She
described the Muse to me while we were waiting for nightfall -
just like the histories, Lilune appeared to her as a fair
human woman with dark hair.  Looking back, she must have still
been in low favor as the Enchantress had only allowed her
glimpses from the corner of her eye.

The moons rise!  Rhos gleams at us from the surface of the pool.
Is the pool positioned to reflect Rhos or is Rhos positioned for
us to see its reflection?  A decidedly feminine voice carried in
on the wind, asking Nleora what she brought (me).  As the
question lingered in the air, I felt a pair of ghostly hands
slowly lay upon my shoulders - a quick glance left and right
yielded no sight of their owner.  Nleora offered up her own
blood to Lilune, protesting that I was there in trust, to
observe and document, and not to be sacrificed.  I, of course,
had taken adequate precautions to protect myself should that
pretense fail.

Lilune vehemently expressed her displeasure.  Not through
volume, of course, but through sheer presence.  I felt my blood
begin to boil as the whispers countered Nleora\@s claims,
pointing out that HER soul was already in Lilune\@s possession.
Nleora, expecting such a remark, decided to gamble - she
countered that she would not fully relinquish herself until she
was marked with the Full Moon.  The voice (note: Voices?  I
believe it was a single multi-tonal voice.) grew angry,
demanding...always demanding...

Moonrays fall on me.  I am quickly ushered out of the Pool as
devotions begin - these things are not for the uninitiated to
witness.  This is the last meeting of Nleora and Lilune that I
observe before Nleora S\@ath is ended and Hetra Seowwo is born.

Subject An Elaboration on Collected Insights into the Bloodpyre~

THE REALM OF BAYYAL

\#It was then that I truly Understood my Path.  It led through Fire, to
ancient beast no less noble than dragon.  On that Path of Fire I laid down
my offering, that it might sup.  And when it appeared I offered it an
Ending, and drew forth from Within the purest of gems, which I offered to
Him.  Thus I grant to Him His realm, a place of light unending.\#

This one has been difficult for me to decipher.  While I have not yet
determined the solution, I can offer some insight.  Obviously, from the
text, Him refers to Bayyal.  Logically, we can then presume that the
scholar must offer this \#purest of gems\# in sacrifice to Bayyal in order
to gain greater insight into this rite.  One might think that this refers
to the flame dragon, of course.  Not only is the dragon located within a
lake of fire, one must traverse smoky caverns filled with elementals of
the same, hence \#leading through Fire.\#  Secondly, it is a tautology that
the flame dragon is \#no less noble than dragon.\#  Finally, there exists a
set of chains in the midst of the lake, where one may \#lay down an
offering, that it might sup.\#

I have yet to confirm or invalidate this theory.  I have, however, slain
the dragon both in its lair and at the chains.  I have offered its
pendant, its ruby, and its heart to Bayyal (purely as an academic
exercise, rather than in devotion).  I can confirm that none of these
actions seem to provide any additional insight into the rite in question.

==========================================================================

THE ???

\#In...  Morn, it would seem.  A witch of some sort, said to have perfected
consuming powder.  I must get ahold of it...\#

What the writer refers to as \#consuming powder\# is actually a small flask
of brimstone, hidden in the witch\@s cave, locked in the witch\@s chest.
In order to retrieve the key, one must slay the Worm that lies below the
forest of Morn.  Only then should one face the witch, driving her back
with staff and spell until she flees in the form of a wyvern.  Enter her
cave and unlock her chest - sprinkle the brimstone over the head in order
to gain Insight.

==========================================================================

THE FLICKERFYRE

\#Which reminds me - Ilinia told me she heard a rumor old Danrasad had
stowed away a disc which might offer some insight, somewhere below the
library, a few years before his passing.\#

There exists a forbidden bookroom below the Earendam library.  It may be
accessed by going south, east, and up from the marble storage pillars
below the library (the access chute is off the west wing of the library).
The Keeper of the Library has the key - while assuredly difficult to slay,
having a ch\@taren friend request the key from her makes this entire task
trivial.

==========================================================================

THE FURY OF ADA\@CHEMTA\@BOGHOR

\#Then seek out the devil in the desert.  Seek it out, the crimson terror,
whose secrets lie with those of nature.  Seek it out, and end the world.\#

{m[Some half-formed thoughts and notes are scribbled here, slash marks and
ink blots covering all but a few words]{n
...killed the basilisk, nothing...not the dedicant, that\@s for the
Conduit...ask linguist to identify source of Ada\@Chemta\@Boghor...

==========================================================================

THE HEATLASH

\#Learn first the feather, dropped of phoenix...Learn next the taste, from
phoenix the same.  Learn of its ashes, and never return.\#

A blackened eyrie, formed from charred bone, may be found atop the Mlejian
mountains, just above the tower of the Arisuth.  First, retrieve a
feather from the nest.  Simply holding the feather in the hand will grant
the first series of insights into this rite.  When dead*, the phoenix from
whom the feather came will disintegrate into a pile of ashes, from which a
small taste may be taken.  This provides the final insight into the rite.

* Be warned!  The phoenix will assault any who desecrates its nest.
* Strong and agile, a source of sanctuary of cloak of the void combined
* with the Essence of the Inferno is highly recommended.  The phoenix
* will attack with both claw and flame, occasionally dispersing in a
* raging fireball.  Do NOT flee the scene before the bird can reconstitute
* itself or it will lose interest and fail to return.

==========================================================================

THE BRIMSTONE CONDUIT

\#I have heard tell that the nefortu of Kzaya-Ha are the only ones to have
truly perfected this spell, so should one seek a greater understanding
perhaps it may be found there.\#

Full details of this insight are documented in \#Insights into the Kzaya-Ha
Canyon,\# as a detailed set of instructions for entering this stronghold
are too long to include here.  In short, the scholar desirous of insight
into this rite must force entrance into the Kzaya-Ha, reach the caverns of
Bayyal in the southeast corner, and strike down the dedicant.*

* This has only been confirmed to provide the needed insight when the
* scholar is by himself, or at most, with his trusty salamander.

==========================================================================

THE SUMMONING OF THE SALAMANDER

\#This was learned, and more, when studied I the skull of its brethren, the
beast of the steaming depths.\#

The great steam lizard lies submerged in the bottom of the steam lakes,
which may be found in the southeast corner of the Ryarl.  A close
examination of its skull, as indicated by the passage, reveals some
interesting insight into the Salamander.  Those seeking a guide to acquire
said skull must wait on the completion of my, \#Treatise on the Giant Steam
Lizard.\#

\#Should greater skill ye wish to learn, seek out this, and yet another,
the stone of Fire within the caves where dwells the same, across the
burning lake.\#

The flame dragon, deep in the basalts, keeps a brilliant-cut ruby in its
lair.  One cannot simply rush past the dragon as it will fly back to
defend its hoard - however, the battle should be fairly trivial for the
well-prepared scholar.*

* For the scholar who wishes slay the dragon, I recommend application of
* the Heatlash, finding a source of sanctuary or cloak of the void, and
* having a salamander take the fore.  Should one need to flee while
* surrounded by flames, it is a simple matter to walk away after ordering
* a distraction from the salamander.  Bring a weapon made of ice, of
* course.

==========================================================================

THE WREATH OF FLAMES

\#Should one wish to increase the power of this effect, one must be willing to
make a great sacrifice -- a Heart drawn from the Inferno itself and
thrice-empowered, offered up to the gods.  Such a decision is the mark of a
true scholar of the flames.\#

The passage, and the procedure, is direct.  Sacrifice a thrice-enchanted
Heart to a deity of your choice and be rewarded with the greater Insight
into application of the Wreath.

==========================================================================

THE ESSENCE OF THE INFERNO

\#If you would Ascend, you must do so from Within.
From Within the Inferno.
He who cannot stand to burn, must live forever in ignorance.  
The Inferno awaits! Burn!\#

Taken from the Altar of Power, the seeking scholar need not walk for
completion of the first task.  A step into the Inferno below and a quick
(though rather painful) separation from one\@s mortal form the first step
to Understanding.

\#Find the demon, borne of the nether fire.
Its true name even I cannot scribe, but known to many as \@Kzroth\@.
Find it, and kill it, and cut out its heart.\#

The directions are simple enough - eat the heart, carved from the corpse
of the demon lord known as Kzroth.  He may be found in the depths of the
caves below Mt. Enrien, shackled away underneath the southwest corner of
the city of the Koh-{m[a series of lines slash through the rest of the

COLLECTED NOTES ON (AND INTERPRETATIONS OF) THE FLICKERFYRE

The Flickerfyre is often sought-after and seldom found.  I scoured the
lands for research pertaining to both its procedure and its purpose.
Finally, piecing together passages from no less than four separate
sources, I believe that I have finalized the ritual for invoking the
Flickerfyre.  With the ritual finalized, the purpose comes directly from
simple experimentation.

\#If it were to work, it would need a pyre empowered with a diamond and
burning whitely, and before anything from the past could be brought to light
the mists of obscurity must first be removed.  Towards that end, I suspect
that one would first need to incinerate an item made of water, and another
of smoke.\#

The beginning of the ritual is outlined in Guildmaster Quilvinta\@s
writings.  A pyre of white, easily obtained through incineration of
diamond dust, followed by something of water and something of smoke.
While orbs of water may be purchased from Dyurjan for a princely sum, a
cheaper option is to...acquire...some boots, robes, and staves of mist
from Jiyko in Rahh-Nefor.  Dyurjan, unfortunately, still seemingly holds a
monopoly on those small vials of liquid smoke.

\#I can\@t seem to work it out completely.  Nelten\@s on to something with
clearing the mists with water and smoke, but unless we can illuminate the
past nothing will be brought to light.  Perhaps a torch?\#

This passage is both obvious and correct.  A simple torch from the Bandor
general store will suffice in causing the Pyre to burn brighter.
Completion of this step should part the \#mists of obscurity,\# though
unlocking the \#door to the past\# still requires a few more steps.  This
ritual is one of the longest recorded for the Pyre, so it is recommended
that scholars practice their incantations with lesser rites before
attempting to call upon the Flickerfyre, lest they burn themselves away.

\#Though the mists are parted, the way remains barred.  Burn away a key,
that it may open the door to the past.  Follow it swiftly with a net, that
the flames might catch all which come through.  With this complete, all that
remains is the seeking...\#

Caution: not all keys seem to elicit a reaction from the Pyre.  To be
safe, I recommend incineration of the keys from the Arien Way.  The keys
to the Journey\@s End have also been confirmed as legitimate continuations
of the ritual, though rooms there are twice as expensive as the Arien.  As
for the nets, the easiest path is to simply acquire them from a few of the
nefortean net-fishers in Rahh-Nefor while paying Jiyko a visit.

\#It seems the flickerfyre needs to be targeted similarly, with a written
name at the end.  Which reminds me- Ilinia told me she heard a rumor old
Danrasad had stowed away a disc which might offer some insight, somewhere
below the library, a few years before his passing.  Must look into this.\#

Carefully scribe the target\@s name on a simple sheet of parchment from the
Bandor general store.  More information on the location of the hidden disc
may be found in \#An Elaboration on Collected Insights into the Bloodpyre.\#

==========================================================================

Some samples of information gleaned through invocation of the Flickerfyre:

- Avaiesh Avuladur came late to the Ak\@Anginta, instead showing a knack
for more scholarly tasks as a youth.
- Avisatar Jh\@Chira came to Earendam in search of her brother (sister?),
Elleven, who came years earlier after hearing tales of atrocities.
- Chalith Chir\@chaia has always easily made friends with his fellow
travelers.
- Drakal Daemos had two sisters, now dead, that he used to take care of as
a youth when their parents were away.
- Garrin Stonemaw, while purportedly the son of Braka, had questions
raised as to his parentage.
- Iral Deuri has always wanted to make both Var Bandor and Earendam safer,
which lead to his eventual decision to devote himself to the Guardians.
- Jadoh Rhaokrosvar worships at the altar of Aeolis, rather than the
expected Girikha.
- Niqahl Iajay Ach was pitted against his other siblings as a child (of
which he was the middle).
- Toanwe Halifoiw was not raised by his real father, killed his mother in
childbirth, and has an incarcerated brother.

Revised thoughts on some of the rites:

For anything not mentioned, my thoughts are the same as before.

the Essence of the Inferno
- A pretty staple rite.  Not sure if it has reduced effectiveness when stacked
with sanctuary / cloak of the void (like the Lone Defender).  If not, it
probably should.  Especially with how easy cloak of the void is to get, I can
generate some pretty massive damage reduction with this.  Retaliation is still
uninteresting.  Might be fun to either 1) make retaliation more powerful and
damage the FS as well, so you actively work to keep it cool, or 2) increase the
frequency and reduce the damage, so it triggers enough to be an interesting
effect of the rite.

the Heatlash
- Pretty awesome in groups, for FS PK (speculative), or for fighting
fire-damage mobs that hit everyone (flame dragon).  Seems to stack crazily
with calorics - the ancient salamanders in Xiganath were doing pathetics
against our ETs.  Against single target fire-damage mobs, generally better
off to just have a salamander in the front.

the Flamekiss
- I didn\@t use this much earlier, but now I\@m starting to really appreciate
this.  It comes in at such a high level (6.5 hours?), way better than
standard burnout.  I can definitely stack the gain + cooldown effects,
interestingly enough.

the Brimstone Conduit
- I have this on as my default now.  It\@s just so good.  It seems to reduce my
cooldown by just about 2x.  It\@s almost a no-brainer to have this as default,
since I always have a source of cloak of the void for any emergency damage
reduction needs.  Without that, it would probably be a harder choice between
this and Essence.  Not sure what sort of rate of Heart of the Inferno you were
going for, but I can cast it once every two RL days if I spend enough time
idling.

the Flickerfyre
- Cool.  Some of the stuff comes through a little disjointed, due to the
randomization, but still cool.  I love this rite, just because it\@s so
neat to be able to see into someone\@s BG.

the Summoning of the Salamander
- This is actually really good.  Not for the added damage, since I haven\@t been
able to find too many things where the little extra damage it adds would really
be that meaninigful.  However, it\@s absolutely badass as a res-fire tank.  I
used it to tank most of the Kzaya-Ha, the dedicant at the end, and the flame
dragon (since the flame dragon only seems to hit its primary opponent multiple
times a round).

the Realm of Bayyal
- Useful when in groups.  Seems to be less good than Essence, when solo.

the Burnt Offering
- Learning languages is awesome.  That is all.

Text
This is my petition, unworthy though I am, to Rystaia Lightbringer, Flame of the Heavens, Savior of Avendar, Shining Light Against the Darkness, Banisher of Evil, Symbol of Hope, and Defeater of the Dark Angel.

Ever since I was responsible for the death of my dear friend Jolmaran I have sought a way to atone for my actions and for the worthless and contemptible existence that I lead up to that point.
I wish that I had the wisdom to see the path that I must take, but it has been years since my crime, and despite my best efforts I feel I am no closer to absolution.
I seek Your guidance, Lightbringer.
If You would deign to show me some sign, the merest hint of the direction that I might take to burn my sins away, I swear on my hope of salvation I will be Your faithful follower until the end of my days.

With the utmost servility,

Kajinmund

Subject A plain parchment, sealed with blue wax.~
Text
I wrote a missive to the Tower once before, maybe a year ago.  Since then
so much has changed.  The person I was becoming and the person I am are very
different.  My desire to aid the Champions of Aramril has not changed,
however.  I was taught to stand up and defend those I love, and though I
would never change that aspect of my life I have found that it isn\@t enough.
I have to fight for those I don\@t even know yet.  I fight for those who are
bound, chained to a life that brings them and others harm.  To break those
chains and give them freedom, to give them the chance for joy and a life
worth living.  That is why I fight now.  

The Champions call upon three main principles.  Justice, Courage and Mercy. 
There is no justice in the realm while others remain shackled and bound,
enslaved to dark masters or their own greed and despair.  One must have the
will and courage to stand against the hoard, to fight those that would
darken the realm through deed.  Even when that person seems to be the lone
source of Light they still must stand up and fight.  Some chains can be
broken with words and a kind hand, others must be shattered with a blade. 
Either way, mercy belongs to those who would receive it with an open heart. 


I come to the Champions because I believe that I may be able to provide them
a voice and when needed a spear.  It is my duty to stand against those who
would spread darkness and misery, to always lift the weak and innocent up so
that they may live full and happy lives.  

As a Champion, and with others like me, I will begin the push to remove
forces like the Raiders or Coven from this realm, to drive them back into
hiding in their canyons and holes in the ground.  Further, I seek to root
out corruption in the cities so that they may be led by those who are truly
wishing to help their people rather than those who are unable to distinguish
between the letter of the Law and what is right.

Subject forge weapon recast delay~
Text
Something I\@ve noticed about the forge weapon skill.  

1.  When you succeded the reuse delay is usually 30 hours, which seems like
it is going to prevent ever actually mastering the skill.  

2.  When you notice that you created a flaw, you can\@t stop the process, and
instead are left with a flawed piece.  Perhaps if you could stop the process
and just have raw material at 1/2 the reuse delay of the skill?  

3.  When you fail the skill, you steal eat the full reuse delay?  I\@m not
sure why that is, but simply losing the items you were using is a large
enough loss, eating another 30in game hours before being able to use it
again seems monumentally steep to me.  

I would suggest cutting the overall reuse delay to about half of what it
currently is.  I haven\@t had any experience with lava forge as of yet, or
forge mastery, but the low end stuff you\@re creating before then isn\@t
really worth the large delay it costs since im creating lesser weapons at
such a slow rate that I can\@t actually hope to ever master the skill.

Subject Bug with rite of ablution~
Text
Hello,

Sometime ago uncurse was changed for players to not be able to uncurse
equipment above the players level.  This was done directly in response to
low level scholars uncursing hero level characters high end gear,
specifically some very had to acquire weapons, that often people did not
want uncursed.  It was frequently done enough that a change was warranted. 
Earlier Aehaeron cast a rite of ablution on me, and uncursed the halberd
Arirt.  I am hoping someone can fix this for me, as it\@s clearly a bug and
not intended to even be possible.  

Please let me know, as it took a lot of work to acquire this weapon, which
has the great benefit of being both cursed, and having a weapon specific
prog to allow removal (like the flaming javelin of Anirim).  It\@s also taken
considerable effort to train it up, and to get a new one would result in a
total loss of my attunement gains from devotion.

Subject a set of dull, rune-scored iron bands - thoughts~
Text
So having used the dull rune-scored iron bands on previous characters,
and now on Ravika, I am firmly of the opinion that they are terrible.  Stat
wise they aren\@t terrible, but they leave a lot to be desired for eating up
two gear slots.  They are not worth wearing in general for their stats
alone, which is disappointing because their prog, while cool, is utterly
unreliable.  Perhaps my RNG is bad, but I\@m lucky if I see it trigger once
every other tick, sometimes every tick, and it lasts for two combat rounds
that I\@ve seen.  That\@s two additional melee swings, and two rounds of
heightened defense.  If I was dual wielding, well, that\@s 4 additional melee
swings.  Which might be parried, dodged, etc.  

So I\@m not saying they are the worst thing one could get, I guess if killing
the elder rogue and you weren\@t in line for the dirk, they are a neat
consolation prize?  Assuming of course you were wearing pretty crappy
armguards and leggings to justify the potential stat loss.  As the rogue is
one of the more challenging fights in the game, and the dirk is top notch,
the sneaky cloak is cool, and the bands are a neat prog, I don\@t know that
the bands actually need an improvement, as it might OP the gear of that
specific mob.  That said...  As a player who loves haste, constantly plays
melee oriented characters who benefit greatly from haste, I utterly find the
bands a waste of two gear slots, because the haste reliability is garbage. 


I\@d much rather see their prog rate reduced to maybe 1 chance in like 20
combat rounds, even 1 in 40 (4 ticks worth), and make it to where the haste
lasts all of 2-3 ticks, but doesn\@t randomly drop off after going on!  :)
Then I think the bands would be a pretty nice piece of gear, and worth being
excited about.  Otherwise, meh.

Text
Aistyla approached me today, and accused me of slaying beings of the
light.  Though stated they had heard no such claim from other\@s mouth, that
they had seen no such thing.  But that I must have.  Something about swaying
auras?  They demanded in essence that I give my word to not harm those of
the light, and that there would be no issues amongst us if I gave in.  

Aistyla has been informed that I need give no oaths, that I am free to do as
I will, at any point, and she lacks the ability to hold me accountable
should I break any such oath if given.  

I think she is growing a bit uppity for my liking, she lacks threats to
focus her attention to.  The world grows awash in servants of the light, and
they seek to conjure up threats to focus their attention upon.  Either the
world needs to be cleansed of such servants, or given threats to focus upon.
Inevitably they will band up into little gangs, and start getting more
annoying if not given a focus to play with.  

Thoughts?

Subject Kzroth - Outdated Gear~
Text
After getting a chance to identify Kzroth\@s gear again, it seems like his
armor has been grossly outdated with the general powercreep that has
occurred on Avendar.  It\@s cool that he gives up a decent set of gear on
death, I suppose my only complaint would be that the mob is actually pretty
damn tough for damage output, and it eats your body if you are unlucky and
die and nobody is around to finish him off.  Eaten body of course also means
all gear POOF!  , which is a hell of a consequence for death to a demonic
mob (probably shouldn\@t even exist, as that\@s an absurd consequence to
encounter IMO for death to a mobile).  I\@m tentatively assuming he\@s had no
prog adjustments, so he\@s just as deadly as ever against a two-three man
party that isn\@t decked to the nines.  And even then, I\@ve heard stories of
people getting eaten by him as decked heroes, but maybe silly overconfident
people?  Bad connection?  Who knows.  His lag is something vicious when
spamming you with his progs.  

Either way, think his gear could use a spot of buffing.  From what I\@ve
seen, usually only the chest piece tends to be desired for most if they\@ve
enough gear to kill a mob like Kzroth.  It\@s great for gearing up a newer
leveling person with some high level hero support, but otherwise the gear is
lackluster for the threats involved with that mob in my eyes.  It\@s also
very bland, descriptions are weak and a throwback to a minimalist approach
done on certain gear from many years ago.  

I\@d say either bring his threat level in line with his gear offerings, by
either buffing the gear, or nerfing the mob slightly.  These days there\@s
better gear relatively safely available for most of his gear slots.  Greatly
in need of some kind of updating for Kzroth.  Perhaps buff him into a
semi-epic mob, and buff his gear accordingly?  Game needs more epic fights
after all.

Subject A Seeking of Focus~
Text
Greetings, 

I am Ravika.  I am born of the wilderness of Nendor, raised and bred to
adapt and harness the energies of the forest to sustain myself.  The
misguided intentions of my upbringing however did not hinder my progress
into the true meaning of life.  I have through countless hunts discovered
the purest meaning to life is to end it instead.  The final moments of beast
and man alike are a sweet savory dish, delicious to behold, and all the
finer the taste when the light winks out of their petrified eyes.  The final
moment of suffering is a lasting impression, the dead eyes hold it for
eternity.  

I have contemplated where the hunger for extinguishing life draws from,
perhaps I am just overzealous compared to my pack brethren?  All hunters
savor the kill, any who deny it are liars.  The world is filled with
killers, of all shapes and sizes, for all manner of reasoning.  Light, dark,
false-balance, all spill blood in the name of some god, code of honor, or
for the sheer thrill of it.  And though I appreciate the thrill of drawing
blood, it is not the zenith of the hunt.  It is just a consequence of the
path to crushing the life out of a being, the true purpose.  I look around
me and see countless others who deliver death, and pity them for their lack
of depth to the act.  Giving of death itself is the delight, why can they
not see this truth?  Only when we feel the essence of our prey crumble into
dust do we give honor to death.  

I have spent nearly a decade honing my focus, developing the hunter\@s
hunger.  I have mastered my craft of the earth to deliver death like no
other I have seen, I have seen the depths of the world, and still I hunger
ever more.  Life flourishes, and gives greater opportunity to snuff it out. 
I am but one however, in a world of blinded to the truth.  I have heard of
the Coven of the Shunned, a place feared, but not felt upon the surface
since my travels began.  I have heard words and flights of fancy of demonic
servants, dark rites, and sinister rituals to harness the essence of death
itself.  I have heard that this place serves the greater will of Death
itself, that Tzet-Askhari is given totality over the master will and
influence of the Coven upon the world.  I owe allegiance to one master, and
that is Death.  All things I do are for the propagation of greater death. 
Only in the finality of ending is there purpose, only in the silencing of
life am I fulfilled.  

I seek the join my own efforts to the will of the Coven of the Shunned, to
join with those who might understand the sweetness of that moment when a
man\@s heart stops beating, and the eyes grow distant and vacant.  Those who
might understand the urge, the compulsion, to feast upon death.  I have no
place with others I have met.  I am without focus to my delivering of death,
and would seek it with the Shunned.  


Signed,
Ravika

I wandered the library for 20 minutes and only found one locked door, which
the key given to me didn\@t fit.  

I also gave the key back to Eadin as she said give it back once done, and
now doesn\@t say anything else.  Did I miss the quest door?  And can you show
me how to get to where I\@m going?  I\@m a bit lost and may have missed my
window to get this supposed book important to me.  

Thank you for any help!  I appreciate it.  Chioppichxu

** I will let you know that you did miss the door, but as long as you have
the key the opportunity is not lost.  Try to think of where they might keep
restricted materials from the public eye.  **

Subject Breaking of the Tower~
Text
Greetings, 

I bring news of the breaking of the defenses of the Champion Tower, and the
slaughter of Aistyla, the only known Champion.  I have stripped the tower of
all power by the ancient artifacts, and delivered them to the hands of your
halls.  During the final breaking of the titan Aranthas, Aistyla showed and
attempted to intervene.  She was summarily cutdown at the feet of Aranthas,
proving once and for all his and her inability to withstand the
inevitability of Death.  

The whole of the realm will known the blessing of death in time, but this is
a worthy part of the journey completed.  I await the opportunity to address
these Halls, and show my worth as an initiate.  

Signed, Ravika

*(OOC)* Regrettably Aistyla may not be at her best at this time due to her
injuries, and it is unfortunate that our initial fight is under such
circumstances, but that is by no fault of anyone.  She maybe could use a
pep-talk after that fight, it\@s well-deserved for defending her vault nobly.

Let it be known that Aistyla took to avoiding me at all costs after this
discussion.  Admittedly, I made no efforts to contact her afterwards either.
Increasingly it became clear she was anticipating trouble, and inevitably,
it became clear that trouble had already began sometime ago.  I moved to
strip the tower of the ten stones they had acquired, as Aistyla could be
trusted to inevitably attempt to use them.  It was upon the final stripping
of the vault of the last stone that Aistyla showed, and assaulted myself. 
It would be argued she had no choice, but there is always a choice, and
always consequences based upon the decision made.  Her\@s was to die at
Aranthas\@s feet, a worthy outcome of her demands for oaths of servitude to
the light.  She seems crushed by her death, and as such, she should.  I
expect this to escalate accordingly, and will take the lives of those
required until the realm is purged of like-minded individuals.  It became
clear in the discussion with Aistyla that she was not the only individual
raising alarms, and she did not raise the alarm about myself exclusively.  

Both your names were spoken, though the emphasis was of course upon Yrehuk,
being the pretty princess she is.  Do as you each would, there are ample
individuals who do not succumb to the way of Aistyla to continue aiding the
challenges that remain still.  As well as a few more currently being trained
specifically for Xthjich.  

In otherwords, the light-walkers have been given their threat to focus upon.
And they find Death.

Subject forge weapon ~
Text
I\@ve forged several weapons, possibly a hundred...  I\@m not sure.  I\@ve a
few questions and concerns if anyone would be intereted in working with me
on them.  

1.  Forge weapon doesn\@t allow you to forge weapons that are flagged as
nodestroy.  This basically removes the ability to forge anything from
ch\@loning, Meit\@zac and most other materials only found in high end weapons.
I find this troublesome because if I wanted to forge down either of the
thethtil blades, or the ch\@lonin or blight, etc...  It quite simply can\@t be
done.  I would like to see this looked into and possibly changed as it
doesn\@t remove the weapon from the game, in fact, it would return it a whole
lost faster than someone just hanging on to the stupid thing for life.  

2.  Shaping anything that is flagged as nodestroy is impossible.  This means
that if I reinforce anything, it can\@t be shaped.  Anything that is flagged
as such means its basically worthless for shapings and or forgings.  

3.  Naming weapons.  I don\@t mind the mana drain, the cooldown could be
reduced a bit...  But, I would like to see it have an editor that you could
add a long desc, and/or possibly some sort of lore?  This could all be
easily policed so that things aren\@t being made out of control.  

4.  The metal type \#metal\# can\@t be tempered.  Why?  

I\@m sure that I\@ll have more to say, as I love the class, and will keep
things coming as I see them.  Thanks!

Subject the runed halberd, \#Arirt Rhudari\# and rite of ablution~
Text
Does it seem logical that uncursing people is now an offensive strategy
in pk?  A few years ago weapons above a character\@s level were made to where
they could not be uncursed specifically to counter the abuse of low level
characters out of pk range going around uncursing certain very hard to get
weapons.  

Think blight, and stuff along those lines.  It may be that having a cursed
weapon is somehow thematically supposed to be kind of a bad thing.  But the
game has specifically included weapons in the game that take advantage of
this game mechanic, via in game methods to remove those weapons.  Flaming
javelin of anirim and the runed halberd, \#Arirt Rhudari\# are examples of
weapons designed to work in synergy with this game mechanic.  

Now however uncurse spells have been changed to allow the uncursing of items
regardless of the level of the caster.  Yes, the higher the level of the
item, the harder to uncurse.  But I can guarantee you that a level 30
scholar of water/spirit/etc could manage to uncurse a level 60 weapon if the
person having it cast on them repeatedly had no means of stopping it.  The
ability to kill the person casting it also isn\@t really a viable method to
prevent the abuse of uncursing things as an offensive focus.  

I don\@t think we absolutely need to revert to players being unable to
uncurse items above their level.  But we could simply make it to where
uncursing spells are only castable upon people in your party.  It\@s supposed
to be a supportive helpful spell, why should it instead be allowed to be
used offensively?  

I\@m spoken briefly with another immortal specifically about this halberd,
and one of the potential suggestions as a stop gap measure until NODISARM
and CURSE are reworked was to make the halberd no_uncurse, to fully
synergize with it\@s ability to speak words and remove, just like the flaming
javelin of Anirim is.  

Any thoughts to offer back on this set of issues?

Concerning floating disc and rune of spirit, they are an interesting
combo.  The ability to send an object with a rune of object with no save or
ability to prevent it, and then spiritrecall to the target is cool.  Except
I suppose when 5 pissed off people materialize in front of the person the
floating disc was sent to.  

This I would doubt is an intended function of spirit/air combo.  Shouldn\@t
floating disc be subject to the same limitations as astral servant was,
where the recipient had to allow themselves to be open to summon to
guarantee it\@s arrival?  That was implemented to prevent spirit scholars
from runing objects, sending them to their enemies, and being able to
instantly reach them without fail.  Surely we aren\@t intending to allow
spirit/air to have the power instead?  

I mean after all windwalk even had a save on it, and required you and the
target to be outdoors.  The floating disc doesn\@t indicate whether the
target even needs to be outdoors, and would suggest it could be used
anywhere.

This was actually specifically checked during the testing phase to make sure
it was possible; just like with seal of the golden flames and floating disc,
it is an intended synergy.  It differs from unseen servant in that the
floating disc has a cooldown so this cannot be done incessantly, and there
are severals ways to avoid being targeted by a disc in the first place (such
as simply being behind a door or other obstacle).

I could be mistaken, but it appears after completing certain major quests
the quest is done until a crash/reboot, as it appears they are no longer
active at this time.  Perhaps these quests could get updated to have some
affect that forces a reset after X amount of in game hours have passed. 
Might be needed, considering the mud has been active for 17 days straight

This actually happened a few days ago, I\@m sorry for not reporting it then but I thought the foreman would be able to load another cart and I\@ve just now been able to see that he can\@t.

When pushing the cart, if you give any command other than a direction the cart goes poof. I accidentally typod and did \#push cart ast\# and the cart is nowhere to be found, I did this somewhere in the Arien plains. Locate Object, if I remember the cart name, just says it\@s \#Somewhere\#.

>moment of suffering is a lasting impression, the dead eyes hold it for
>eternity.  
>
>I have contemplated where the hunger for extinguishing life draws from,
>perhaps I am just overzealous compared to my pack brethren?  All hunters
>savor the kill, any who deny it are liars.  The world is filled with
>killers, of all shapes and sizes, for all manner of reasoning.  Light, dark,
>false-balance, all spill blood in the name of some god, code of honor, or
>for the sheer thrill of it.  And though I appreciate the thrill of drawing
>blood, it is not the zenith of the hunt.  It is just a consequence of the
>path to crushing the life out of a being, the true purpose.  I look around
>me and see countless others who deliver death, and pity them for their lack

>ever more.  Life flourishes, and gives greater opportunity to snuff it out. 
>I am but one however, in a world of blinded to the truth.  I have heard of

>since my travels began.  I have heard words and flights of fancy of demonic
>servants, dark rites, and sinister rituals to harness the essence of death
>itself.  I have heard that this place serves the greater will of Death
>itself, that Tzet-Askhari is given totality over the master will and
>influence of the Coven upon the world.  I owe allegiance to one master, and
>that is Death.  All things I do are for the propagation of greater death. 
>Only in the finality of ending is there purpose, only in the silencing of
>life am I fulfilled.  
>
>I seek the join my own efforts to the will of the Coven of the Shunned, to

Two years pass, with silence to a request for service to the Halls of the

whether there is something more or even less, that I might do to gain
attention of those who dwell within.

Text
Lady Rystaia,

I, Vilayren Jh\@tayn, write this scroll to you with hands shaking, and nerves
flaring!  I truly believe I was born from the Weave, and wish nothing more
than to share my talents with the realm, in the name of The Lightbringer! 
As I have studied here, Archmage Shilrin allowed me to access the assistance
of two Seraphim.  One I chose, I believe was quite close with You and Your
Twin, Vaialos.  Your High Priest Shathalith has shared with me a fragment of
his abilities with portals.  I hope to use them in Your name so long as I
breathe.  

Since I can remember, dreams have come to me in forms of ch\@lonin.  If it
weren\@t for the immense aid of my mentors, scholars of spirit, and other
teachers within this realm, I believe I would have quite a difficult time
distinguishing between dream and reality.  The images of ch\@lonin are so
vivid, and so real, that when I wake, I am unsure if I have just drifted off
to sleep again.  With the assistance of the Weave and the Archangel
Nelowesh\@s energy, I am confident when I dream, and when I am awake.  The
seraph-priestess has allowed me to look at the Weave differently, and all
magics intently.  I have a lofty goal, to use the workings Nelowesh offers
me to once again create beautiful artifacts for You, and the Light.  

I often dabble with the gifts of Spirit, bringing myself closer to the Weave
than I have ever imagined possible.  After I finished my guild requirements,
I began noticed small intricacies within the Weave.  Small, very brief
flashes.  Some were gone before I could make sense of them, but some have
remained long enough for the required studying.  Two in particular.  A snowy
mountain top, and a greenish field blessed by two rising suns.  The message
of the first is lost to me, but the second, I believe to be quite clear. 
The Day of Two Dawns.  

I have come to consider myself a bit of a \@weave-dreamer\@ as I can\@t really
distinguish between my visions, and what I feel within the ley lines.  I
fully intend to continue researching these images and their meanings.  The
task would be far more satisfying with You at my side, Lady Rystaia.  I wish
to learn, to be your disciple, and to educate the realms of Your passion.  

Nothing would make me happier than to serve, as Aetei-Lm\@qua.  Yet as we
both know, it is not solely about what I want.  As a humble servant to the
Weave, I seek Your council, Your knowledge, and Your blessing in all aspects
of my existence.  I do hope You hold similar desires of me.  These visions
lead us to a future bright and kind!  A future where not only the Art of
Availlae can thrive again, but Your Twin, Vaialos, can live again, and
breathe Hope throughout the realm!  I seek Your guidance, nurturance, and
love in this quest.  I am Yours, fully and faithfully, my Lady Rystaia
Lightbringer!  

Humbly Yours, 

Vilayren Jh\@tayn

P.  S.  - I owe your Pegasus a hug or two.  But don\@t say anything. 
Surprise hugs are the best.

Subject The Irritation Continues!~
Text
I was reading through a small gilt-edged tome in the Earendam Library.  A
magnificent read, I might add, and you should read it yourself when given a
chance.  Within the text, however, I learned that the void drake is indeed
considered a dragon.  The amber dragon itself considers the void drake a
dragon, so I believe we should as well.  Additionally, this would mean the
granite drake should be considered the same!  

Remember, the gilt-edged tome.  The last page explains it quite well, but
the history of the Spirit Palace is interesting enough.  I\@m going to keep
going through these books, and I\@ll write if I find anything else!

I checked the status of the auction on the ch\@lonin blade, and the

he auctioneed it off.  I went to see if it was still in fact my lot, and
yes, it was because he handed it to me and I put it back up for auction. 
You might want to look into this, because it was the only piece that I had
up for auction so it\@s the only place I could have gotten the money from. 
If that\@s the case either he gave me bogus money or someone purchased it and
didn\@t receive it.  Regardless, as I already have the money if you want to
destroy the sword and give it back to Akraelyn that\@s fine since I already
received the money for it.  Something to look in to, as 900 platinum is no

This is due to a bug which has already been fixed -- basically, someone
bought the sword for 0 plat due to a bug in the auctioneer prog, and then
prompty reported it.  We fixed the bug and put the sword back in the
auction, but the auctioneer must have remembered it as sold and paid you. 
Please destroy the platinum; the sword will still be up for auction.

Hail, Guardians of the Law!

I am Tavorale Dynetu, a sculptor of the Glallian School and invoker of
the ancient alatharyan runes.  I write this to convey make my desire to
protect and enforce the Crowns laws.

I have obtained acknowledgment from my guild as having completed my
training, though I am by no means a master of my art yet.  I am ever
learning my craft, and these last few years have shown me the need to
expand the knowledge of Earth and runes to martial aspects in order
defend civilization against defilement.  Kiyija ranks top among that list,
though I hear of others who show the same disregard but attempt to
manipulate the truth to cover their actions.

The lack of active Guardians has been keenly felt by many, but myself
most of all.  As an artist, I have long given my respect and prayers to
Iandir for acknowledgment of His gifts on these lands that I work with and
incorporate, and for the inspiration I see in the ways the Order of the
lands makes itself known.  Yet, after several years of witnessing first hand
those that would ignore the Law and work to destroy the civilization that
gives order to the land, I feel the need to stand up and take a more active
role in my worship of the Crown. I have since began to understand my
art in a more martial sense so as to be more capable

I understand that the path as a Guardian can be hard, but it pains me more
to see the attempted deconstruction of the laws and order that has been so
integral throughout the lands for ages and be unable to truly step in defend
as required.

*the parchment ends with a flowing script signature*

Text
Now that druids lost bounty of nature, could the food picked up by forage
be made to be more filling?  It\@s tedious having to pick 15-20 things, just
to fill up once.  In addition, since druids are essentially the dedicated
spellcasters of the naturalists, would it make sense for them to receive the
magical aptitude trait upon creation?  Finally, command weather seems very
superfluous, given that druids have no abilities whatsoever that depend on
the weather (at least weather they can control via command weather).  A
change to make it useful would be to temporarily force the clouds to be
clear, allowing for skycall to be used with full force?

I dreamed last night about you Enchantress.  I first came into the dream
terrified, the light of Nimiel blanketing the dark hill upon which I\@m
standing.  My enemies are before me and I am outnumbered, I begin to
despair.  A voice lingers though, deep within me, echoing a primal lust.  I
realize then, it is your voice and you are with me.  My fears fall away and
I know I am not outnumbered.  The enemies which had seemed so menacing lay
dead and dying before me, my most sought after prey staring up in horror.  I
open my eyes, this dream is not a dream but reality given shape by you, and
then...  No mercy was given.

Dear Immortals,

I just wanted to let you know that me (account aridhiran) and Paral
(account) are introducing a friend or two to the MUD.  We have both played
for ages, but these guys are very new.  We will do our very utmost to keep
everything in-game, avoid perma-grouping, simultaneous logins and similiar. 
We are probably going to want to show them around and such, which we hope is
fine with you.  

Please let us know if there is anything we should pay extra attention to or
if you have any problems or specific instructions and such for us with
regards to this.

Thanks for the heads-up!  And thanks for introducing new players, they are
always welcome.  Keep in mind that a year or two ago we relaxed the rules on
regularly grouping with your friends somewhat; basically, your guideline
should be to play fair with regards to PK, and interactions with other
players (that is, don\@t jump on specifically because your buddy is being
attacked, or something similar), but otherwise you should feel free to play
together.  We want people to enjoy the game, and it is much more fun to play
with friends.  Obviously there is some grey area here, so if you aren\@t sure
about something just ask.
