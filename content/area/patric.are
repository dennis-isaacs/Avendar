This young man is a templar of the Order of the Secret Heart, tasked with
guarding the maze that bears their name.  Once, the Order was peopled with
the greatest of Earendam\@s templars.  With the passage of time, though, and
the rise of Earendam\@s power, the Order is made up mostly of young templars,
untested in war.  Popular practice among nobles in the Patrician\@s favor is
to send their youngest children to join the Order, where they receive
martial training, as well as experience at court.

Rugater~
Rugater, the templar Marshall of the Secret Heart, stands here.
~
Rugater is a templar marshall, head of the Order of the Secret Heart. 
Once a great battle leader of Earendam\@s armies, his career was cut short
when he lost his arm in a battle to the death with a powerful srryn fire
templar who was plotting to lead his people to war.  Now retired, he trains
the young templars of the Order, and stands watch over the maze.  He is
well-known among the Patrician\@s political circles, and often acts as
advisor in military matters.  

Neither retirement nor dismemberment has softened Rugater, whose field armor
is polished and ready for battle.  The man himself is tall and lean, with a
whip-like quality to his movement.  His face is craggy with age, and
features several prominent scars acquired in battle.  Steely gray eyes peer
out from under his helmet, evaluating the world in terms of the battlefield.

Rimiasti, last hierophant of the Sakmi Sjijia, tends to this place.
~
Rimiasti is an incredibly ancient caladaran, and a powerful druid.  His
frame is very tall, and extremely thin, even for a caladaran.  Stringy
silver hair hangs from his head, with the consistency of tree moss.  His
skin is as barky and rough as any of his kind, but the brown tones are
mottled with gray, marking his advanced age.  He wears a robe of living
green, which flows around him, following his all-too seldom movement.  

The last hierophant of the Sakmi Sjijia, Rimiasti tends the \@Sha Ec Shanc\@,
or \@The Gift of Firiel\@, the scion of the Great Tree which grows here in the
maze.  As part of an ancient covenant, both he and the tree bend their power
to protecting the obelisks here, which mark the final resting places of
Aramril and Salyra.

Tedilda Bitna~
Tedilda Bitna, the wealthy merchant, strolls about the palace.
~
Tedilda Bitna is a short man, just over five feet tall.  He wears rich
robes of green silk, and is draped in a wide assortment of gold and precious
gems.  He carries himself with a certain confidence and aloofness, but his
square, blocky features belie the fact that his fortunes were made in trade,
not through a noble inheritance.  

Bitna is one of Earendam\@s wealthiest merchants, having made his fortune in
river trade with Var Bandor, and moving furs and gems across the Uthlin. 
Wealthy enough to not be ignored even by the nobility, he is a frequent
guest here at the palace.

Reolus Savalan bank councilmember council member pcouncil man shriveled~
Reolus Savalan~
The gaunt, bespectacled Reolus is here.
~
Reolus Savalan is exceptionally tall and shriveled, and seems hardly to
have an ounce of fat or muscle on his body.  Balding and bespectacled, he
keeps what few wisps of hair he has combed back.  He wears a suit of deep
blue velvet, with a ruffle of white lace on his chest and at his wrists.  

Savalan sits on the Patrician\@s Council, the most powerful ruling body in
Earendam outside of the Patrician himself.  Prodigious analytical abilities,
and a savant-like skill at tallying sums lead to a career in Earendam\@s
great banks.  After making several fortunes for his noble, but poor family,
he was eventually appointed to the position of treasurer on the Council, and
has continued in that position in Vaelania\@s service, remaining a
consistently frugal master of the exchequer.

Kanlarus Velda scholar hunched man councilmember council member pcouncil~
Kanlarus Velda~
Kanlarus Velda is here, puttering about the palace.
~
Kanlarus Velda is an older man, on the border between his middle years
and true old age.  He is tall, but walks with a slight hunch, puttering
about with a pronounced scholarly demeanor.  His eyes are a liquid brown,
and his nose sharp and prominent, but most of the rest of his features are
obscured by a thick silver beard.  He wears brown robes, embroidered with
faintly glowing arcane symbols, and numerous mystical accoutrements dangle
from his waist.  

Kanlarus sits on the Patrician\@s Council, the most powerful body in Earendam
outside of the Patrician himself.  Long known for his abilities in using the
magics of earth in architecture, he also has studied at the Tower of Salyra,
focusing on the more divinatory aspects of the magics of water.  His
combination of experience and breadth of knowledge, as well as a lack of any
major political enemies were instrumental in securing his position on the
Council.

Aranil Enreo swordmaster man tall general councilmember council member pcouncil~
Aranil Enreo~
Aranil Enreo strides with bold grace about the palace.
~
Aranil Enreo is, like most of the nobility in Earendam, a tall man, with
sharply chiseled features.  Unlike most of those who grow soft from the ease
of city life, however, Aranil is quite fit, particularly for a man nearing
his middle years.  Aranil\@s face is free from wrinkle or line, but his hair,
which he keeps bound behind his head, is a deep gray.  

Aranil sits on the Patrician\@s Council, the most powerful body in Earendam
outside of the Patrician himself.  The youngest scion of the Enreo house,
Aranril traveled to Ilodaiya to train as a swordmaster in his formative
years, honing his already substantial natural abilities to become a master
of his art.  Upon his return to Earendam, he became an officer in the armies
of the city, winning decisive victories in a series of battles marking the
end of the Third Kankoran War.  Prompted to the rank of general, he rapidly
rose in the ranks of Earendam\@s forces, until he was eventually chosen by
Danrasad to sit on the Council.  He has continued to serve with Vaelania\@s
election, angering many, younger leaders within the armies who might have
considered themselves better-suited to the task.

Curil Nasen diplomat dandy man portly fop pcouncil council councilmember member~
Curil Nasen~
Curil Nasen is here, meandering about the palace.
~
Curil Nasen is a short, rotund fellow, of middling height.  Well into
middle age, he is completely bald, and wears a velvet hat to cover his pate.
A bit of a dandy, his clothes are a picture of red velvet and violet silk,
finely tailored to hide his bulk.  He wears a sizable amount of jewelry as
well, most of it quite gaudy, despite being made from precious stones.  

Curil sits on the Patrician\@s Council, the most powerful body in Earendam
outside of the Patrician himself.  Rumored to be a bastard son of the Nasen
house, he nevertheless was named heir to his families fortunes, which he
plied into attaining a position at court.  He has something of a reputation
of a reveler and a dilettante, but is also known for his golden tongue. 
Amusing his betters, and surprising his peers with his gifts, he has risen
to become the diplomatic advisor to the Patrician.

Qenlea Ryeleandra ethron woman willow pstrumpet willowy green hottie lady~
Qenlea Ryeleandra~
The strikingly beautiful Qenlea works her way through this area.
~
Qenlea Ryeleandra is an ethron woman, quite obviously in the prime of her
youth.  Slightly tall for an ethron, she is just over five feet in height. 
She is clad in a skirt of metallic bronze, slit up the side to expose her
long, graceful legs.  She wears a top of similar material, which follows the
lines of her body up to her bodice, where it accentuates her ample bosom. 
She drapes a shawl of white silk around her shoulders, letting the ends
dangle to the edge of her willowy hips.  Her deep green skin highlights the
colors she has chosen, and her features are refined, rather than the rugged
look one sees of most ethron.  She smiles mischievously, and her soulful
brown eyes are alight with what merriment she finds in the moment.  

Qenlea is quite popular at the Patrician\@s Court, having a somewhat storied
history.  Orphaned as a small child, she was adopted by one of Earendam\@s
noble families, who found her on the edge of their estate.  Raised at court,
she married a wealthy and noble suitor at a young age, only to suffer
tragedy when he died of illness.  Despite these adversities, she has assumed
the role as head of her husband\@s house, and is once again popular at the
court, due to both her political connections and cheerfulness in the face of
tragedy.

Astal Djuris is a military man both in bearing and in form.  He wears the
simple yet effective plate armor of the soldiers of Krilin, and a stout fur
cloak is slung over his shoulders.  Head shaved for the wearing of a war
helm, only a shock of blonde bristles, his blue eyes, and the crest on his
armor mark his heritage as a man of Krilin.  Somewhat out of place amidst
the splendor of the palace, he is here on a diplomatic matter that brings

Jaril Alidru aelin swordmaster pdiplomat regal noble~
Jaril Alidru~
The regal aelin Jaril Alidru stands here.
~
Jaril Alidru is an aelin of noble and regal bearing.  His most striking
feature is his wings, which are a delicate gold, with swirls of deep blues
and reds along the tips and edges.  He wears robes of a vivid red, and a few
tasteful items of gold jewelry.  He moves with a casual grace, accentuated
by a few moments of striking speed.  At either side of his belt are long
scabbards, neither of which ever seem to leave his sight.  

A member of one of Ilodaiya\@s noble houses, Jaril is currently the city\@s
diplomatic representative here in Earendam.  Unlike the majority of aelin,
Jaril is one of the few who has foresworn the insular life of most of his
people, choosing instead to dabble in the politics of the Dantaron river
valley.

Yarif Hagad~
The immense Yarif Hagad stands here.
~
Yarif Hagad is an enormous man, easily six feet tall, with biceps as
large as good-sized tree-trunks.  He is a swarthy man, with dark skin and
flat, square features.  His head has been shaved, leaving behind only a
simple topknot.  A ruby earring dangles from one ear, and a topaz gem
affixed near his eye breaks the lines of his smooth-jawed face.  

Yarif is one of the eunuchs of the house of Hagad in Ashta Harrud, nominally
a bonded servant of the house but in practice a man in a position of much
authority.  He has been sent by the master of his house to participate in
one of the numerous and interminable trade negotiations with Earendam, which
occupies a large portion of the diplomatic maneuvering occurring between the
two cities.

Jokta Vamal warlord barbarian lord lordling chieftain pdiplomat man savage~
Jokta Vamal~
The warlord Jokta Vamal is here. 
~
Jokta Vamal is a tall, savage man, with an impressive physique and very
unrefined features.  He wears a vest of what appears to be wolf fur, pants
from the hide of some great beast, and a belt made from the skull of a
griffin.  Battle scars decorate his arms and face, and a particularly nasty
gash runs along one cheekbone.  
  
Jokta is one of the warlords who have come to dominate the lands east of
Earendam\@s holdings, called the \@Rirro Jagka\@, or \@Broken Land\@, composed
from a tapestry of warring kingdoms and villages.  Despite the chaos and
political instability of the region, Jokta has risen to some measure of
power there, enough to attract the attention of the Patrician.

Saevan aide aelin psionicist tall paide~
Saevan~
Saevan, one of the Patrician\@s aides, is here.
~
Saevan is a slender aelin, clad in robes of soft blue silk.  His wings
are a muddy brown, and he moves with a refined grace.  He is obviously not
one prone to great exertion, but his frame is light, and his features are
sharp and well-defined.  As with most aelin, he is quite beautiful, but his
most striking feature is his eyes, which settle with an usettling focus on
the object of his attention.  

Saevan is one of the Patrician\@s personal aides, responsible for providing
her with information as well as assisting in the day to day duties of
leadership.  Saevan began his career as a Guardian, building his reputation
for dispensing a methodical, if fair brand of justice.  After a successful
tenure in that organization, he attracted the attention of the late
Patrician Danrasad, who was greatly impressed by his talents and his
attention to detail.  After his death, he has continued to serve Vaelania in
the same capacity he did her father, pausing only when she undertook a
period of study and taking the opportunity to do so himself.

Rhentil man gaunt aide scribe assassin paide2~
Rhentil~
Rhentil, one of the Patrician\@s aides, is here.
~
Rhentil is a lean, angular man, whose thin form stands out under a robe
of simple gray.  His eyes are a bit gaunt and sunken, pointing to time spent
indoors and in the fitful light of a scribe.  Rhentil is one of the
Patrician\@s aides, principally in charge of preparing and organizing the
vast traffic in scrolls and messages going to and from the palace. 
Reportedly, Rhentil was taken as an orphan off the streets of Earendam by
the late Patrician, who was impressed with the deftness of the boy\@s hand.

golem diamond guard pguard prismatic glow titanic immense~
a diamond golem~
A titanic diamond golem stands guard here.
~
This titanic golem is carved from a single block of diamond.  Easily as a
tall as an alatharya, it is roughly humanoid in shape, with a few notable
exceptions.  One of its arms lacks a hand, instead terminating in a
sharpened spike of diamond.  Its head lacks mouth or ears, but does have
eyes, in the form of rubies inset in cavities designed for that function.  A
flickering glow emanates from within its interior, occasionally bathing it
in an eerie prismatic light.

Patrician Vaelania Elinstad woman tall ppatrician~
Vaelania~
Vaelania, the Patrician of Earendam, presides over the court.
~
Vaelania is the Patrician of Earendam, making her the political ruler of
the city and all of its outlying estates and provinces.  Her face has been
marked with a faint pain that almost vanishes when she smiles; that aside,
she carries all the classical beauty of Earendam\@s daughters.  In her late
twenties, she wears her honey-brown hair woven in an intricate braid down
her back.  Despite her slender build, her height and the rich golden robes
of her office give her an almost imposing look that well matches her high,
clear speaking voice.  She wears a dress of deep blue velvet, tailored to
accentuate the beauty of her lithe form.  

The last remaining scion of the ancient house of Elinstad, she was elected
Patrician after the murder of her father, the former Patrician Danrasad,
narrowly edging out the closest contender and favourite of many to win. 
Keenly aware of the myriad of threats that could come against her during her
reign, she followed in her father\@s footsteps and studied the magics of
earth to better protect herself.  In the dawn of her reign, she stands
prepared to make good on her promises to return life and prosperity to the
city after the devastating Eyeblight War.

Ayelir~
Ayelir, bard to the Court, is here.
~
Ayelir is a short ch\@taren, about five feet tall.  His gold skin glitters
with a faintly translucent sheen, particularly striking against his vivid
red and blue silks.  Renowned as the bard who composed the famous Gondar
Cycle, his fame and skill with both poetry and the harp has led to his
employment in the Patrician\@s palace.

Patrician Danrasad Elantin man imposing ppatrician~
Danrasad~
Danrasad, the Patrician of Earendam, presides over the Court.
~
Danrasad is the Patrician of Earendam, making him the political ruler of
the city and all of its outlying estates and provinces.  He is a tall,
imposing man, with sharp, hawk-like features and steely grey eyes, unclouded
by age.  His hair is a fine white, though his face is lined without seeming
ancient.  In his seventies, he has reigned as Patrician for over forty
years, presiding over a return to prosperity and expansion in Earendam.  

A scion of the ancient house of Elinstad, he was named Patrician after a
number of short-lived politically weak leaders had come into the position. 
A scholar and an artist, he surprised the city by proving his decisive
leadership and his prompt military action and victory in the Third Kankoran
War.  Following this, he acted to reestablish some of Earendam\@s ancient
trade routes, leading to a gradual expansion in trade and the current period
of prosperity.

A huge man stands before you, polishing a large double-bladed axe with a
ragged cloth.  An unruly mane of tangled black hair falls unevenly about his
hardened face, casting a shadow over his hawk-like features.  His muscular
frame is loosely attired in a patchwork of frayed hides, worn from years of
use.  
  
As a child, he was rescued from the shuddeni slave pens by an expedition led
by Lord Protector Malyn.  Melaith grew to be strong as an ox, and rose
quickly through military training, and now represents Malyn in the Alliance
Army.

As the second to rule the Port Town of Gaald, Tanar has expanded the
town\@s influence as a port greatly from the times of his father, Hadrar
Gaald.  His solidly built frame was honed handling cargo on the docks he so
skillfully commands, learning, in his youth, all the intricacies of sea
trade and sailing.  He was also trained by the great warrior Firalmol in his
youth, thus he is masterful with weaponry as well.  In the years since, he
has led the defense of the Gaald region against the undead blight on the
southern borders, and has become an able and experienced military commander.

Relandas Indatand is a tall elderly man, with sharp, hawk-like features
and steely grey eyes, unclouded by age.  His hair is a fine white, though
his face is lined without seeming ancient.  His armor and weapons are plain
and unadorned, but of the sort that is very serviceable in capable hands. 
While dressed like a common soldier, his imposing bearing is unmistakably
that of one accustomed to command.  

He appears to be recuperating from serious injuries.  Several vivid red
scars mar his cheek, and he favors one leg as he stands or walks.

The Rod of Dimarro has been the symbol of Earendam\@s power and authority

order, the Rod is said to bear little love for those who would unmake what
its power represent.  

Dimarro is quite potent as a magical artifact in its own right, but those
who would dare to wield this symbol of Earendam without the permission of
its liege might do well to tread warily.

seems to maintain a steady warmth.  

A legendary artifact of Earendam, the Rod is considered the symbol of the
Patrician\@s leadership.  In legend, the Rod was a gift from the caladarans
to the Republic upon its inception.  A sage of that period prophesied that
the Republic would not fall until wielded by the hand of man.  The first
Patrician, Corvandil, wielded the Rod of Dimarro as a symbol of this new
order, bringing an end to much of the old system of government in Earendam,
if not its traditions.  Rumored to have eerie powers relating to maintaining
peace and harmony in its presence, the Rod remains the most well-known of
the trappings of the Patrician.

A strange metallic ring lies here.~
The Ring of Adi is an artifact from the time of the ancient alatharya,
and was unearthed from a cache in the Brintors by a band of adventurers,
lead by the doomed Sydonus, the archmage Phandaal, and the Guardian
Skrinlare.  

While the ring dates from the time of the alatharya, legends and story have
it being not of their craftsmanship at all.  Instead, it points to the ring
having some odd association with Avendar\@s moons, as well as the ability to
alter and shape the flow of time

After the ring was found, it was worn by the assassin Sydonus, who used it
to great effect in battle.  The ring stayed with Sydonus until he met his
doom in the Halls of the Shunned.  

After that, the ring\@s history is somewhat murky, but is believe to have
been worn by a kankoran berserker.  The berserker and his tribe encroached
too far to the south, and met their ends at the hands of an Earendam patrol,
and the ring found its way to the palace.

sword mir-adan mir adan~
the Sword of Mir-Adan~
A beautifully crafted ancient sword lies here.~
The sword of Mir-Adan is an artifact of the ancient alatharya, unearthed
from a cache in the Brintors by a group of adventurers lead by the doomed
Sydonus, the archmage Phandaal, and the Guardian Skrinlare.  

What little is known about the sword\@s history before the Sundering points
to it as a warrior\@s weapon, born by ancient alatharya swordmasters.  The
sword\@s powers seem to reflect a warrior\@s needs -- while bearing it, one
can travel in most any environment, at any time, and anywhere.  

After it was returned to mortal eyes, the sword was born by the Guardian
Skrinlare, who wielded it to great effect against his enemies.  As one of
the relatively few shuddeni among the Guardians, he was already widely
feared, but was doubly so when wielding this sword.  

It is known that Skrinlare lost the blade to the Raiders of Twilight,
whereupon it was born by the swordmaster Rascyc, lieutenant of the feared
highlord Shiyul.  

Rascyc bore the sword until his death, but records of its presence vanish
after that.  It is suspected that it was taken by thieves, who later fell to
the Earendam guard, and hence delivered to the palace.

the Dagger of Yazor~
A wicked looking dagger lies here.~
The Dagger of Yazor is an artifact of the ancient alatharya, recovered
from a cache by a band of adventurers lead by the doomed Sydonus, the
archmage Phandaal, and the Guardian Skrinlare.  

Nothing is known of the dagger\@s history before the Sundering (other than
its name, by which the adventurer Sydonus claimed it bore), but it is a
potent weapon for any assassin or thief.  

Along with the normal affliction of the blade, the dagger is said to bear
some magical potency that weakens and tears at the health of those who fall
victim to it.  Rumor has Sydonus felling a giant with the blade, but this
remains unverified.  

Sydonus bore the blade for some time, but it was known to have left his
hands by the time he faced his doom in the Halls of the Shunned.  Perhaps he
lost the blade in Earendam, as a guild war erupted among the various
thieves\@ groups in the city, and the dagger was eventually confiscated by
the Patrician\@s guard.

A diamond crown rests on the ground.~
The Crown of Nilundar is one of a collection of ancient artifacts
unearthed by a group of adventurers led by the doomed Sydonus, the archmage
Phandaal, and the Guardian Skrinlare.  

Not much is known of the crown\@s history, as it predates the Sundering of
magic, but what stories there are tell of it as the crown worn by the last
king of the alatharya in their people\@s feudal era.  Its grandiose and
unique nature certainly bears this out, but it is impossible to tell if this
is only conjecture.  

More is known about the Crown\@s more recent history, after is was unearthed
in an ancient valley in the Brintors.  The archmage Phandaal chose this
crown, intrigued by its obviously magical properties.  

After finding the crown, Phandaal was often seen wrapped in the white light
of sanctuary, despite being a practitioner of the void, so that it least is
one facet of this artifact\@s power.  Phandaal bore the crown until his
ascendancy under the aegis of the gods of knowledge (some accounts have him
building some sort of machine that granted immortality, others have him
being taken up from his wizard\@s tower by the hand of the gods), and willed
the crown to the city of Earendam, for its tolerance of scholars and magic
users of all kinds.

ring sligura opal midnight black rat~
the midnight opal ring of Sligura~
A ring of midnight opal rests here.~
Sligura was a practitioner of the void, and a despicable example of the
breed.  He served at the right hand of the Raider Highlord Dyrck, spreading
his foul magics at the bidding of his evil lord.  

Scorned for his eccentric habits (Sligura often used the sewers of Earendam
as a hiding spot, resulting in his title, \@The Lord of Rats\@), Sligura
nevertheless became an extremely powerful archmage, able to stand toe to toe
with the most talented of the enemies of the Raiders.  

This ring was his answer to those who mocked his time spent in the less
pleasant places of the city.  Over the years, he sacrificed countless
rodents and other vermin in the course of magical experiments, gradually
gathering their vital energy to be bound into a focus for mystical energy. 


The garish ring which bears Sligura\@s name is almost as hideous as the
habits of its master, but it is almost certain that it is the fruits of his
unwholesome experiments with rodentkind.  

Sligura\@s end is not known -- some say he perished in one final battle with
the Guardians, while others say he died of old age while working in his
sewers, and served as a fitting repast for the rats.

staff Belerin oaken oak~
the Staff of Belerin~
A long oaken staff lies here.~
The archmage Belerin is widely regarded as one of the most powerful
archmages of water to live in recent memory.  Widely respected as a healer,
he was also a formidable adventurer.  

Drawn by the lure of new knowledge in the wilds, Belerin plied his craft in
the area surrounding the Dantaron River valley, winning aclaim for doing
everything from stopping a prince of the elemental plane of air to facing
off against the mighty Sothmogga in his astral prison.  

As powerful as Belerin was, his ways and his magic were extremely subtle,
and all of his creations were made with an eye to this philosophy.  

As wise as he was talented, Belerin was also a powerful force for balance,
and was unwilling to reap the rewards of his adventure if it meant
endangering the world at large.  Rumors are rife that he once held the heart
of Sothmogga in his hands, but chose to destroy it rather than allow its
power to be unleashed on the world.  

Belerin\@s final fate is not recorded -- some say he was taken into the
heavens to serve as a servant of the gods of knowledge and wisdom.  Others
say that he left the material plane in search of knowledge elsewhere, while
more mundane accounts have him establishing a conclave of healers and
scholars far in the south of Avendar.  

This staff is most likely Belerin\@s greatest lasting achievement (his
spellbooks being lost to the ages).  After his disappearance, the staff was
found floating along the Dantaron, where it was found by a small village
boy.  Rumor, magic, and stories followed the staff, but it is clear that not
many have truly understood its power.  

Fragmentary reports indicate that the staff requires time to bond itself to
its wearer, but then achieves greater potency.  One story tells of the
archmage Sagenar, who despite his mastery of the black arts of the void,
could only cause the staff to produce a spring, by chanting the words
\@Tadelb No Azrad\@.

In the centuries following the War of Night, the grand hopes of those who
sought a better world in the alliances formed in that great conflict were
sadly disappointed.  Most aelin only wanted to isolate themselves from the
world, having seen its effect on their own brethren in the person of
Serachel, and the devastation wrought by the war.  Ethron brokered a peace
with the Great Republic, receiving sovereignty over large forests such as
Qilarn in return for assurances that they would be left to their own
devices.  The Republic, whose resources and armies has been left in ruins by
the war, found worrying about peace somewhat unapropos in the middle of what
amounted to a protracted civil war with its provinces.  The ch\@taren, freed
from the threat of annihilation, and finding themselves in a completely new
world, reverted to their natures, and by and large scattered to the four
winds.  

The shining example of cooperation between the powers, Kor Thrandir, was
left as the only visible sign that they had once all been allies.  The
senate of Earendam, seeing that they were increasingly unable to maintain
direct control of holdings in the Brintors, decided to take action.  They
divided up the Brintors into several region, giving direct control to
nobility who would pay tribute and remain nominal vassals of Earendam. 
Along with these agreements, the nobility ceded the Brintors would maintain
the roads through the mountains, as well as acting to settle them whenever
possible, to act as a bulwark against any potential future shuddeni
incursions.  

One well known such territory is the barony of Krilin, which persists to
this day in the form of the city which bears the same name.  Another
territory lay on a mountainous spur of the Brintors, which jutted down along
the edge of the Uthlin.  Located near an old shuddeni outpost, it was
considered a perfect location for new fortifications.  And so it was that
the Duchy of Paelaran came into existence.  At first, the duchy flourished,
and its people lived in a tower on the coast of the Uthlin, trading and
fishing along the eastern part of the sea.  

The fortunes of the age were not with the people of Paelaran, though, and
their numbers dwindled.  A plague ravaged their tower city in the second
century after its founding, and a chilling of the climate in the region
ravaged their economy in the fourth.  During the first kankoran war,
Paelaran was captured and sacked by the main body of the kankoran horde, and
most of its people fled to Earendam.  In the chaos following the fall of the
Republic, Paelaran was abandoned for some time, but eventually resettled. 
It retained only a fraction of its former glory, and its halls lay empty. 
Lacking the population to support a standing army, the tower\@s remaining
nobility took up the very dangerous task of training the griffins who
roosted in the aeries near the city.  Little is known of the actual taming
of the beasts (as griffinriders even in the early days guarded their secrets
from outsiders), but it is suspected some power of air or spirit is
involved.  The griffinriders enjoyed a period of fame where they were the
stuff of legend, but Paelaran still lacked the citizenry to regain its
former glory.  

By the time of the third kankoran war, Earendam called upon the
griffinriders to help them in battle against a group of marauding human and
kankoran mercenaries in the hill country of the Rirro Jagka, further east of
the Uthlin and Earendam.  Discharging their ancient debt, the griffinriders
helped turn an even battle into a rout of the opposing forces.  

Unfortunately for the griffinriders, the other arm of the mercenary army
took the opportunity to attack the undefended Paelaran.  The tower was
sacked, burned, and razed, as the mercenaries prepared for the next battle. 
Returning to the city, the riders came upon the recently unprepared
mercenaries, and drove them into the Uthlin.  

Grief-stricken at the fate of their people, the griffinriders swore to
protect that region of the Uthlin for all time.  Unwilling to live in a
centralized location again, they took to living with the griffins that they
had trained, becoming a part of the ecosystem of the mountains.  

Today, the griffinriders mainly keep to themselves, but actively police the
area near the Uthlin and their section of the mountains, hunting wild game
to feed both themselves and the griffins they tend.  In most cases,
griffinriders are descendants of the nobility of Paelaran, although some
adventurers join their ranks after deeds of exceptional nobility and daring,
and after they have proven they can bond with the great griffins.

A set of steel gemworker\@s calipers lie here.~
Originally made for the well-known gem artisan Aril, these calipers are
of extremely fine crafstmanship.  They are made of strong, precise steel,
and are honed to fine points at their ends.  The handles are curved in a
perfect but smaller replication of the gem-gripper.  Judging by the
craftwork, they appear to have been made in Ilodaiya.  They bear the
markings of the Azerilon family, a well-known house of tool-making for the
fine arts.

Inside the Gates of the Patrician\@s Palace~
The gates of the Patrician\@s palace lie south of here, a grandiose set of
intricately carved silver archways, woven with runes of strength and
durability.  Just inside the gates, marble alcoves are set on either side to
allow for guards on duty.  Once past the wall and gates, a verdant,
immaculately tended lawn stretches to the north.  The Patrician\@s palace is
located squarely in the center of the green, a gigantic, gold-domed building
whose marble columns tower over everything within the walled enclosure of
the palace grounds.  A set of tall marble statues brackets a whitestone
path, which leads directly north to the palace.  Southward, the gates open

A Path between the Statues~
This whitestone path leads from the Patrician\@s Gate in the south, to the
palace in the north.  A truly massive structure, the palace is topped with a
shining gold dome, and supported by immense marble pillars, all carved from
the stone of the Brintors.  Closer than the palace, though, are a set of
marble statues which stand to either side of the path.  The statue on the
western side of the path is a man, clad in the armor of an ancient templar. 
The statue to the east is of a woman, who wears the robes of a scholar.

To the north looms the Patrician\@s palace, its marble walls polished and
white.  Atop the great building is a gold dome, perfectly balanced and
supported by the columns which frame the structure.  Between the walls and
the dome is a frieze done in bas relief, which circles all the way around
the base of the dome\@s hemisphere.  Cut in the side of the palace, a square
archway leads into the interior of the palace.  Short of the palace, a
whitestone path leads off to the south, crossing the lawn and eventually
heading south out to the gates.  Standing to either side of the path are
life size marble statues, each standing atop a pedestal to elevate them to
above-human height.

A Lawn Near the Palace~
This green and verdant lawn comes to an end here, ending in a neatly
trimmed line against the south wall of the palace.  A grandiose, impressive
edifice, the palace is topped with a dome of solid gold.  The walls are
solid marble, supported by pillars and buttresses, all carved in the classic
Republican style.  A decorative frieze frames the edge of the wall which
meets the dome, and follows the course of the building along a wall to the
west.  The lawn continues to the south, while the corner of the palace is to

North of a Raised Patio~
This region of the Patrician\@s lawn sits at the bottom of a small set of
stairs, which lead up to a raised marble patio.  The patio, however, is not
as tall as the hedges which lie to the north of here.  The immaculate rows
of the tall plants make up the Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia, a famed attraction
of the palace.  This particular locale provides an exceptional view of the
palace, whose gold dome rises above its marble colonnade.  From here, the
palace seems perfectly symmetrical, its golden hemisphere and diamond-shaped
base perfectly centered around an imaginary azimuth from north to south. 
While the patio opening rises to the south, there is a gap in the hedges to
the north, clearly marking the beginning of the maze.

Vestibule of the Patrician\@s Palace~
The vestibule of the Patrician\@s palace is lavishly decorated, and filled
with the trappings of luxury in keeping with the long and storied traditions
of Earendam.  Used as a receiving area for petitioners to the Patrician\@s
court, comfortable silk couches hug the southern wall of the vestibule,
situated conveniently near the entrance.  A soft melodic trickling fills the
air, coming from a crystalline fountain in the center of the room. 
Underfoot, grey marble tiles are arranged in concentric circles around the
fountain, and are magically shaped to be without flaw or imperfection.  The
room is lit by a diffuse yellow glow, provided by some permanent mystic
enchantment.  Hanging to either side of a northern archway are flags with
the heraldric symbols of the past noble houses which have provided Earendam
with Patricians.

between the pillars is covered with an enormous mural, depicting various
scenes from Earendam\@s history.  Underfoot is a carpet of golden silk, which
runs parallel with the columns.  Above, a chandelier enchanted to provide

fourth~
The Day of Two Dawns came at the darkest time in the War of Night, after
the city had nearly been taken, and the army routed in the Trap of Valandas.
A battle was fought at dawn on the southern shores of the Uthlin, and
Earendam\@s army was forced to withdraw to the walls of the city, with the
shuddeni in hot pursuit.  

As night fell and the shuddeni prepared for an assault of the city, the
ch\@taren vanguard appeared, blasting forth with their magics of light and
spirit, sailing across the Uthlin on a fleet of scavenged sailing ships.  

Expecting an easy victory at night, when their powers were greatest, the
shuddeni were instead decimated by the ch\@taren, who brought a second dawn
as they drew upon the powers of spirit to defeat the shuddeni.  

Here in this mural, the ch\@tarens are painted as beautiful and angelic, with
bolts of light striking down the shuddeni before them.  At their head is
Curalin Tyra, the leader of his people during the war.  
~
E
third~
The most effort has been expended on this third scene, which is a
rendition of the so-called \@Trap of Valandas\@, perhaps one of the most
famous battles of the War of Night.  Near the midpoint of the war, following
the fall of Var Bandor, human forces led a daring offensive against the
shuddeni, attempting to drive them back beneath the surface of Avendar.  

The dance card of heroes at the Trap was prodigious.  Among them was the
storied general, Kalyius Urhban; the legendary swordmaster, Envarinon; the
healer-priestess Iliraya; and the famous tactician, Lystaran.  The
Earendamian procession fronted what is quite possibly the largest human
army in recorded history.  

Unfortunately for the forces of Earendam and the Army of the Golden Hand,
this offensive was doomed from the beginning.  Betrayed by the archmage
Kaagn, the shuddeni were prepared for the massive human onslaught, and
prepared their own army of demons and chaja for a carefully laid trap.  

In the mural, the human army is portrayed in all its glory and strength, led
by knights in gold armor, backed by the army of Earendam, marching defiantly
into the darkness of the shuddeni juggernaut.  
~
E
second~
The second scene in the mural is of the Battle of Aramril, a victory in
the War of Night.  Vast ranks of shuddeni swell in the hills of the
Brintors, their black banners darkening the ground, and the blades of their
chaja slaves glistening with wet blood.  In the middle of the scene is the
tower of Aramril, which is guarded by a legion of Champions, all clad in
white.  

Overhead, an immense black dragon is ridden by an aelin woman, and is flies
among a contigent of black-robed aelin, their hands and eyes crackling with
dark magic.  The dragon\@s darkness is countered by a woman on the top of the
tower, who is no doubt the legendary Amiraiya, female templar and leader of
the Champions.  A white bolt from the heavens surrounds her, enveloping her
in a protective halo.  

The faces of the Champions are resolute, each engraved with the look of men
and women whose time to die has come, and who have made their peace with
death.  Beyond the hills of the Brintors marches a force from Earendam,
lightening the otherwise dark mood of the scene.  

~
E
first~
The first visible scene in the mural is the darkest, as it concerns the
fall of the city of Var Bandor in the War of Night.  Grey-skinned shuddeni
and monstrous chaja storm over the walls, putting the hapless citizens of
the city to the sword.  

The armies of Earendam are seen as too late to save Var Bandor, but still
valiantly holding the shuddeni back from sailing the Dantaron to loot
Lithling Valley and gain easy access to their own city.  
~
E

The chandelier is made of platinum, drawn from the depths of the
Brintors.  Rather than candles, however, there are small balls of magical
light, which are attached to the chandelier\@s fixtures.

murals~
The murals in this area of the hall are all of battles from the War of

known as the Army of the Golden Hand.  The mural is designed to make the
entire course of the war one continuous battle, but on closer inspection,
the following scenes can be distinguished: 

FIRST scene: The Fall of Var Bandor
SECOND scene: The Battle of Aramril
THIRD scene: The Trap of Valandas
FOURTH scene: The Day of Two Dawns

E
mural~
The murals in this area have one primary theme -- the fall of the old
Republic, and the rise of the reign of the patricians in Earendam.  

Dark, accusing colors paint the scene of the infamous \@Last Senate\@, who
fled the city upon news of an advancing kankoran horde near the end of the
first Kankoran War.  Each of the Senators is a craven, cowering figure, and
they are seen departing Earendam with the treasures of the city carried in
tow.  

Outside the city wall, an angry bedlam of snarling, red-furred kankoran
warriors approaches.  The people of Earendam gather on the walls, fearful,
until a noble figure appears.  Corvandil, the first Patrician, leads the
people in defense of their city, bravely standing at the forefront of
battle.  

The kankorans are driven back, despite great expense to the city\@s northern
expanse.  After the battle scenes, the city is slowly rebuilt, set amidst a
series of grim depictions of the fates of the Last Senate.  To a man, each
senator meets with a gruesome end.  One is hung by his own golden belt,
another stabbed in the back by his own servant, yet another devoured by a
package of savage kankorans, and most brought to trial in the court of the
Patrician.  The last of their deaths occurs near the end of the mural, which
terminates in a gold sun setting over a rebuilt and revitalized Earendam.

the west.  The chamber is made almost entirely in gray marble, from the
smooth tiles of the floor to the large pillars inset in the stone of the
wall.  A few decorative plants by the western exit provide a splash of color
to the room, and a few plush chairs for guests are seated along opposing
walls.  Aside from the open archways to the east and west, there are solid,
ironwood double-doors which open to the north and south.

Curving Passage~
Curving from east to the north, this semi-circular passage follows the
outside wall of the Patrician\@s Court.  Light in the chamber comes from soft
silver balls of light, which are set in niches in the walls at periodic
increments along the passage.  Ornamental stone carvings dot the molding on
the edges of the floor and ceiling, and a deep red rug covers the marble
underfoot.  The passage ends to the east and north, in both places
terminating in a set of ironwood double-doors.

Southwest of the Patrician\@s Court~
The Patrician\@s Court is a vast, circular chamber, built over what was
once the chambers of the senate.  Overhead is the golden dome of the palace,
its spherical course beginning near the wall to the southwest and arching
upwards to the north.  The walls of the chamber are carved from solid
marble, divided into sections by pillars made from the same stone. 
Underfoot, a mosaic made up of precious and semiprecious stones makes up the
magically smoothed floor.  

Visible in the center of the room is the Patrician\@s Chair, from which he
presides over the legal and diplomatic business of Earendam.  The chair
stands on a raised podium, and has seats to either side for various members
of the council to sit in attendance.  Here, in the southwest part of the
chamber, curved stone benches radiate out from the center of the room,
stretching along a diagonal to nearly the outer wall.  The benches are made
of the same marble as the chamber, and provide seating for guests of the
court.  There are no exits from the court here, but archways are visible in
the outer wall to the north and east.

In the Patrician\@s Court~
The Patrician\@s Court is the center of legal and political activity
within Earendam.  The court is designed around a high, golden chair, seated
in the epicenter of a vast circular chamber.  To either side of the chair
are seats for the various members of Earendam\@s council, all of which are on
the same raised dais as the Patrician\@s seat, if at a somewhat reduced
height.  High overhead, a golden dome arches upwards, terminating in an
oculus designed to illuminate the chair at midday.  

In front of the dais is a red rug, made from a thin, elegantly woven silk. 
Radiating out from the center are carved stone benches, which follow
diagonal lines to the southeast and southwest.  Before the chair is a block
of obsidian, which is tall enough to act as a stand for those who come to
the court.  Standing behind the dais, in the northeast and west corners of
the chamber, are two tall statues, which are positioned to look down
directly onto the court.  An aisle leads out through the stone benches to
the east, west, and south.

human tribes.  It survived the War of Fire, and was later used in the
Republic, where those who addressed the Senate stood before the stone.  

Unfortunately, the original stone was lost or destroyed in the First
Kankoran War, and it was not until the reign of the Patrician Danrasad that
this replica was constructed.  Now, all those who come to petition the
Patrician stand before the stone, as they are under the symbolic and often
literal judgement of his law.

in his guise as lawgiver.  A tall, stern figure, Iandir carries a tablet in
the crook of his arms, and a scale in the other.  While not formally a
patron deity of Earendam, his long worship by the humans and caladarans in
the Dantaron and Aragol river valley have ensured that he is highly revered.
Having risen further in promise under the reign of the Patricians, Iandir\@s
statue is a gift from the Glallian School, perfectly shaped by artists who

statue~
Jolinn\@s statue is carved by hand from grey marble, drawn from the
Brintors.  The statue was originally carved by chisel, and now these mark
the passage of time on the piece.  Worn smooth in other places and slightly
chipped in others, the statue is easily centuries old, and perhaps even
millennia old.  

The statue bears its age with dignity, though, and portrays Jolinn in his
aspect as a stately general.  His ageless features are set in resolution
determination, and to his side he carries the legendary Sapphire Spear. 
Great attention has been paid to the cast of Jolinn\@s eyes and the set of
his face, which seems somehow gentle, despite the martial tone of the piece.

cerulean of tempera and crushed sapphires.  Luxurious, plush, indigo chairs
of crush velvet are seated near the door in the south wall for the
convenience of visitors.  Away from the bed, and flush with the western side
of the room, is a magnificent desk, whose top is a slab of flawless blue

A dazzle of crystal fills this chamber, which is one of the many guest

composed of hundreds of prism-shaped crystals, arranged in narrowing bands,
and eventually terminating in a single large crystal tetrahedron.  

The room\@s bed is carved from solid oak, but is inset with quartz, zircon,
and the bedposts are tipped with diamond.  Underfoot, the floor is tiled
with squares of glass, magically enchanted to be unbreakable.  A similar
glass cover provides surface for a pine desk, that has knobs made from
coin-sized diamonds.  A slight breeze blows through the room, producing
soft, melodic tones from the chandelier.  The only exit from the room lies
through double-doors, which open to the north.

The Marble Chamber~
This chamber is a tribute to the aesthetics of marble.  Already prevalent
in the Patrician\@s palace, here marble is ubiquitous.  The floor is tiled in
soft browns, and the decorations are in the room are all statuettes and
pillars.  The bed is covered in soft cushions, but its frame and posts are
all smooth, magically-shaped white marble.  Light in the chamber comes from
ornate candelabras, which are affixed to stands beside the room\@s desk.  The
only exit from the chamber lies through an ironwood door, which opens to the

statuette~
The form of these statuettes is quite unusual.  Rather than being the
strictly realistic artworks which are so common among Earendam\@s historical
artistic traditions, they are instead the result of experiments with magic
and the creation of art, such as that often seen produced by the Glallian
school.  

These statues are studies in form, rather than content, and shape marble in
exotic, almost alien ways.  One statuette in particular is quite singular,
portraying a roughly tree-like shape, whose branches fork into smaller and
smaller structures, growing too small to see near the tips.  The bifurcating
branches are nevertheless quite dense, and twist and wind to almost
completely fill the space of the statue.

The Sky Chamber~
A cunningly crafted illusion veils this bedroom, which appears to be a
round disk suspended high in the air.  Azure sky and wispy nimbus clouds
stretch around this platform in all directions, and there is a gentle sense
of motion as the clouds swirl and flow around the round floor. 
Incongruously, there is a bed in this place, made from a dark oak that
contrasts with its white silk coverings as well as the colors of the nearby
clouds.  Other than a few chairs, the only other furnishing in the chamber
is a white marble vanity, complete with a silvered mirror to reflect the
stunning skyscape which is all about.  Other than a drop off the edge of the
platform, the only exit is through a freestanding ironwood door, which lies
to the north.

The Chamber of the Sun~
One of the many guest chambers in the palace, the Chamber of the Sun is
designed in aesthetic tribute to the sun.  An gold icon of the rising sun is
affixed to the north wall, and gazes beneficently across the chamber. 
Murals on the wall show noble city-dwellers frolicking under the light of
day, while sturdy farmers and fishermen harvest the fruits of the sun\@s
gift.  The chairs and bed in this chamber are all gilded with gold, and
encrusted with citrine and ruby.  A soft, gold light suffuses the chamber,
about the brightness of the morning sun, and the temperature is as pleasant
as a spring day.  The only exit from the chamber lies through ironwood
doors, which lead to the south.

The Chamber of the Moons~
The Chamber of the Moons lacks almost all color, its decor striving to
match the feel of pale moonlight on a dark night.  The floor is a
checkerboard of black and white marble, and murals on the wall depict
noblemen at hunt under the full moons.  The ceiling is a raised dome,
colored the charcoal black of the night sky.  Tiny diamonds glitter on its
surface, and icons of silver and ruby represent the moons Lunus and Rhos.  A
large bed fills part of the chamber, made from ebony, but covered by a
canopy of white silk.  A soft, pale light illuminates the chamber, emanating
from the silver moon icon on the ceiling.  The only exit from the chamber
lies through ironwood doors, which lead to the north.

Passage near the Banquet Hall~
This hallway runs through the eastern half of the Patrician\@s palace, and
is used by visiting guests and nobles to access the court and banquet halls.
The walls of the passage are made from solid marble, but underfoot the floor
is an interlocking oak tile.  A few paintings on the wall give the marble a
bit of color, and floating yellow spheres provide light.  In the north wall,
a pair of grand golden double-doors leads to the banquet hall.  To the
south, a similar pair of silver doors leads to the palace\@s ballroom.  To
the east, the passage continues, heading toward the side gate of the palace.

Banquet Hall~
The banquet hall of the Patrician\@s palace is a long chamber, easily
large enough to hold a dragon lengthwise.  An enormous rectangular table
fills most of the chamber, made from hand-crafted oak.  Along with the
silver place-settings on the table, the banquet hall is decorated with
enormous wall paintings, visible on the east and west walls to those seated
at the table.  Three crystal chandeliers hang from the ceiling, the light of
their candelabras filling the room with a flickering golden light.  In the
south wall, an enormous set of gilded doors leads out of the banquet area to
the hallway.  To the north, a simple wooden doorway leads to the kitchen and
is used primarily by servants.

The Palace Kitchens~
These great kitchens serve the Patrician\@s palace.  Great ovens line the
east wall, built to bake bread and roast meat, made from solid iron and
heated by magical fire.  To the west, a grill sits over a bed of hot coals,
and to the east, pots of stew and soup are heated inside stone hearths. 
Various spare utensils hang on the walls, and low tables are scattered
throughout the room, used for preparing and readying food taken to the
banquet hall to the south.  A stairwell begins in an alcove to the

chairs are seated around the edge for those not using the floor.  Small
tables are placed periodically between the chairs, holding ewers of wine and
decorative vases and statuettes.  The only exit from the ballroom is to the

Equal parts trophy room and museum, this room has many bits and pieces of
Earendam\@s history on display.  The pieces come in all shapes and sizes, but
most are of martial origin, speaking to Earendam\@s more militaristic past. 
There are several full suits of armor on display, various weapons behind
magically protected trophy cases, and even the skeletons of rare beasts, all
on display for visitors to this place.  A door made of iron leads from the

is the most grand, generally being sets of full plate, generally some
precious metal magically enchanted to be stronger than the finest iron. 
Armor from nearer the present period tends to be a bit more loose less
bulky, with magical enchantments allowing them to provide just as much
defense as their precursors.

is used by visiting guests and nobles who enter the palace\@s side gate.  The
gate, which lies to the east, is used by visiting noblemen and those in the
Patrician\@s favor to enter the palace.  Made from ornate bronze, it is still
wide enough for two men to enter abreast, and exits out onto the palace
lawn.  Two statuettes by the gate provides the decor for this hall, which

A light, airy chamber, the salon is designed to receive guests and

chamber, in pairs or triplets around small and often ornate tables.  Small
windows set in the east wall and the occasional candelabra provide light for
the chamber, which also contains a harpsichord in one of its more well lit
corners.  The floor is a tile of marble, covered with a soft, red carpet,
embossed with various sigils associated with Earendam.  The only exit from

molding gilds the baseboard and wall edges of the corridor, and vivid
portraits give the place a living, rich color.  The floor of the passage is
made from white marble tiles, but is covered with a silk carpet dyed a regal
blue.  West of here are the offices of the Patrician, beyond a grand door
encrusted with gems and made primarily of gold.  To the east is a simpler

devoid of the finery that dominates the rest of the palace, this place is
largely furnished in a minimal fashion.  A solid pine desk sits near the
east wall, and a small stool sits behind it.  Near the door is a scrollcase,
where messengers leave and pick up documents that pass through this office. 
Light comes from candles recessed in alcoves, and the floor is covered with
a simple brown rug.  An oak door opens to the west, providing an exit from

The Office of the Patrician~
This is the private office of the Patrician, meticulously polished and
upkept.  Every inch the chamber of Earendam\@s most powerful citizen, even
the door of this place is made from gold and encrusted with gems.  The room
itself is lavishly furnished with several upholstered chairs worked in
smoothed ghara hide, which sit in front of an enormous wooden desk.  Behind
the desk is a regal chair, gilded with gold hewn from the Brintors, and a
tall bookshelf.  In the corner is a large globe, which stands on a tall
pedestal of crystal.  An ancient tapestry covers the north wall, while a map
of the immediate region and common trade routes is framed to the west.  The
walls have been freshly painted powder blue, giving the room an open, airy
feel.  The only exit from the chamber lies to the east, through the
gem-encrusted door.

In the center of the painting is a caladaran, carrying a pillar writ with
the Law of Iandir.  He approaches a group of humans on the banks of the
Dantaron, who argue and quarrel with one another, unaware of the gift that
is to be bestowed upon them.

white carpet covers the floor of the chamber, and the bed is a canopied

The Patrician\@s Quarters~
These are the bedchambers of the Patrician Vaelania, everything kept
well- polished and dust-free for the Lady\@s usage.  There is a certain
historical weight to the feel of this chamber, with its antiquated ironwood
bed and gold embroidered wallpaper and moldings.  Offsetting this is the
Patrician\@s own aesthetic taste, which lends the room a surprisingly
delicate, feminine air.  

Standing to either side of the room\@s door are a pair of matched crystal
vases, both filled with sprays of light violet flowers.  Two modest
portraits hang on the wall, elegantly framed by dark oak.  The floor is a
mosaic of tiny tiles, the image they form covered by an intricate Harrudim
rug patterened in white and pale blue.  The great bed has been canopied with
effervescent violet silk, and against the northern wall is set a white
marble vanity with a gleaming silver mirror.  The room is lit by an ambient
magical glow, with no source in evidence other than that shed by the
ch\@lonin door to the east.  The only other exit from the room is through a
stone door, which lies to the west.

The other is a more recent, magical rendition of the Danrasad Elinstad, the

The Patrician\@s Greenhouse~
This large, rectangular room was once used by Vaelania\@s father,
Danrasad, as his personal sculpting studio.  However, it has since been
renovated with a fortune in glass, serving as a place for her to indulge in
her own creative endeavors.  The room now serves as a pleasant, personal
greenhouse where a myriad of flowers, both local and exotic are grown.  The
warmth of the room is thick with floral and earthen scents, a number of
planters and individual watering and trimming tools set about both for ease
of access and aesthetic design.  In the main open space of the room, an oak
and wicker deck chair provides a place for her to relax and look at her many
blossoms.  On the southern wall sits a painting which magically alters
itself every so often in some fixed, if unpredictable way.  Tucked in the
corner of the room, almost so as to escape notice, sits an unfinished marble
statue.  A stone door leads east into the Patrician\@s quarters.

lawn is visible, as well as the famous hedge maze known as the \@Sakmi
Sjijia\@.  Various comfortable cushioned chairs sit on the patio, along with
tables for light snacks and wine.  The edge of the patio is surrounded by a
low marble wall, but there are breaks in the wall in all directions, which
turn into stairs leading down to the lawn.  Behind the patio is the bulk of

Entrance to the Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia~
This is a roughly square region lies near the southern entrance to the
Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia.  The maze is made primarily from great hedges,
warded to prevent travel through their boundary.  Smaller shrubs and plants
also dot the landscape of the maze, interwoven in a fine net of greenery
with the hedges.  On the whole, this makes the area of the maze outside of
the entrance a confused tangle, with the way into the depths of the maze not
readily apparent.  There is a break in the plants to the south, allowing

In the Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia~
The Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia is named in truth, as it is a winding,
twisting labyrinth of plants.  The backbone of the maze is a tall garden
hedge, warded to prevent travel through their boundary.  Smaller shrubs and
plants also dot the landscape of the maze, interwoven in a fine net of
greenery with the hedges.  The overall effect of this is a bit confusing,
with exits obscured by blind alleys and the twisting of the floral walls.

In the Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia~
The Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia is named in truth, as it is a winding,
twisting labyrinth of plants.  The backbone of the maze is a tall garden
hedge, warded to prevent travel through their boundary.  Smaller shrubs and
plants also dot the landscape of the maze, interwoven in a fine net of
greenery with the hedges.  The overall effect of this is a bit confusing,
with exits obscured by blind alleys and the twisting of the floral walls.

In the Sakmi Sjijia~
The Sakmi Sjijia, the \@Secret Heart\@, lies in the middle of the maze that
bears its name.  A tall, magnificent tree grows in the center of the
clearing.  Its leaves are of many colors, and a wide variety of fruits and
flowers grow on its limbs.  Two tall, marble obelisks stand near the base of
the tree, sheltered by the bolls and roots.  

Rough, unpolished rocks trace geometric patterns on the ground, radiating
out from the tree, and partitioning the Sakmi Sjijia into several grassy
regions.  In one of these regions is a sundial; in another, a quiet pool
supported in a cairn.  All around this place are the hedges of the maze,
which are a confusing melange of green, leafy plants and the taller hedges.

The tree is truly magnificent, and is known as the \@Sa Ec Shanc\@, the
\@Gift of Firiel\@ brought to Earendam by the first caladarans.  Alleged to be

These two obelisks are worn and weathered, having stood the test of time

elements.  

Carved faintly into the left obelisk is the word \@Aramril\@, and carved into
the right is the word \@Salyra\@.  Both are decorated with the runes of
ancient human death rites, so old as to make it almost believable that these
obelisks truly mark the final resting place of the fabled templar and
scholar.  

There is a small etching on the back of the right obelisk.

In the Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia~
The Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia is named in truth, as it is a winding,
twisting labyrinth of plants.  The backbone of the maze is a tall garden
hedge, warded to prevent travel through their boundary.  Smaller shrubs and
plants also dot the landscape of the maze, interwoven in a fine net of
greenery with the hedges.  The overall effect of this is a bit confusing,
with exits obscured by blind alleys and the twisting of the floral walls.

In the Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia~
The Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia is named in truth, as it is a winding,
twisting labyrinth of plants.  The backbone of the maze is a tall garden
hedge, warded to prevent travel through their boundary.  Smaller shrubs and
plants also dot the landscape of the maze, interwoven in a fine net of
greenery with the hedges.  The overall effect of this is a bit confusing,
with exits obscured by blind alleys and the twisting of the floral walls.

Topiary~
This topiary is located at one end of the Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia. 
Hedges walls hide the rest of the maze, interspersed with a thick web of
greenery which obscures the true exit from the area.  Growing in this
circular sward of grass is a topiary, composed of fantastically shaped
hedges and bushes arrayed with geometric precision.  They have recently been
trimmed, and creatures can be discerned in the shapes of the bushes: There
is a dragon, a griffin, a great titan, a huge misshapen chaja, and several
human figures.

Gazebo~
Set in a clearing in the Maze of the Sakmi Sjijia, a cunningly crafted
white gazebo is hidden here amongst the hedges.  The gazebo contains a
wooden table, with seating in the form of a few circular benches.  Outside
of the grassy area surrounding the gazebo, though, the maze immediately
begins again.  Its hedges are interwoven with a net of thick greenery, which
winds all about the gazebo, obscuring exits from this place.

Base of the Southwest Guard Tower~
The structure of this room makes its function apparent.  Built into the
base of a squat stone tower, this chamber is designed to withstand assault
from without.  The walls are made from stout bricks, joined at the seams by
thick mortar.  The ground entrances are to the east and north, both of which
are blocked by heavy iron portcullises.  Arrow slits are cut strategically
in the walls, and a steel murder cages are attached to each of the
entranceways.  A spiral staircase leads up out of the chamber, guarded by a
cylindrical wall and a narrow entranceway.

Atop the Southwest Tower~
This guard tower stands in the southwest quadrant of the Patrician\@s
Palace complex, overlooking the southern gate and lawn.  The tower is made
of hewn granite, and is constructed to be strong enough to withstand a
siege.  Ramparts provide cover for archery and defense of the top of the
tower, and a bed for coals and a metal cauldron is in the corner, for use in
the heating of oil.  Also here is a tall, wooden support, from which hangs a
golden bell.  The tower is about five feet taller than the walls of the
complex, and the buildings of Old Earendam can be seen to the west, nestled
amidst the course of the Dantaron River.  A circular staircase exits the
tower, heading down towards its base.

A Secret Chamber~
This secret chamber lies far below the Patrician\@s palace, and is
completely free of the dampness or mold found near an underground chamber so
far below the water table.  The chamber is roughly circular, with a
dome-like ceiling made from marble bricks which provide support.  The room
is devoid of decor, but does have a niche in the north wall from which a
narrow spiral staircase ascends.  To the south, there is an enormous iron
door, inset with numerous visible wards and glyphs of protection.

The iron door is the masterwork of some blacksmith, and could easily
withstand a charging alatharya.  Along with the impressive construction,
however, the door is also protected by a series of extremely powerful wards
and glyphs designed to protect the integrity of the door.  

The door has a keyhole, designed to fit some specially crafted key.

The Treasure Chamber~
The treasure room is a vast, cyclopean chamber, located far below the
Patrician\@s palace.  So large is the chamber, compared with the relative
boundaries of the palace and the depth of the place that some form of
magical manipulation of space would have been necessary in its construction.
Certainly, powerful magic is present here -- inscribed on the floor is an
enormous magical seal, which traces an intricate pattern about most of the
room.  Sealed coffers are affixed in niches around various parts of the
room, magically holding their contents secure.  

One of the coffers here is open, not yet full and magically sealed.

The Duke\@s Pavilion~
The white canvas of the pavilion is suspended from a high, broad wooden
frame, the center of which is a thick post of pine.  The floor is covered in
stacks of boxes, barrels, chests, and various other containers, but a wide
space is cleared near the center post.  A table stands next to the post,
covered in maps and miscellaneous parchments listing troop numbers and
movements.

A Green Pavilion~
In this spacious pavilion of green canvas, lanterns hanging from the
support frame give off a soft light.  Boxes and heaps of equipment for the
troops line the walls.  In the center, the grass has been worn completely
away, the dirt hard-packed.  Tables, chests, and chairs are placed
throughout, for use of the quartermaster and those helping to coordinate the
alliance army.
