a burly srryn~
A short, burly srryn stands watch over the caravan.
~
The dull green scales of this srryn are chipped and broken in places,
with scars and the pockmarks of old injuries in evidence over much of his
body.  Though somewhat diminutive, his heavy, powerful limbs seem to exude
stability and force.

a hulking chaja~
A hulking brute of a chaja is here, watching alertly.
~
Fully eight feet in height, this chaja is tall and wide enough to have
trouble with even the largest doors, as is evident from his apparent habit
of keeping himself hunched.  His slightly bowed head leaves him with a
permanent glowering expression, and his constant, loud breathing only
heightens his air of menace.

The remaining eye of this grizzled veteran is a hard, flinty brown.  His

a robed human scholar~
A flamboyantly-robed human is here, his skin covered with colorful tattoos.
~
Fancy robes of exotic fabric bedecked with beads and spangles swirl about
this man, clacking and jingling as he moves.  His face and hands are covered
in tattoos and jewelery, so much that it is almost difficult to make out his
actual skin.

a srorsian~
A srorsian stands in the wagon train\@s traces.
~
A large, brown scaled lizard, the srorsian lumbers about upon four stumpy
legs.  Its back arches into the air and its body tapering into a long,
thick tail about five feet in length.  Its head is small, compared to the
rest of the creature and its black eyes gaze about its surroundings in
apparent oblivion to the goings-on around it.  The lizard is harnessed to
the wagons with thick leather traces.

the shade of Elue of Isel~
The shade of an ethron forester hovers here.
~
The shade of an ethron forester has a translucent form the pale color of
late-summer growth.  Its eyes are a more intense, vivid green and flicker
intensely, as if focused on memories now only it can see.  Long chestnut
side-braids strung with a few dark, ethereal feathers hang down, brushing
along its jawline.  The shade\@s wide-shouldered frame, solid as an old
cyprus root in life, now has a sense of fading impermanence, like a leaf on
the wind.

a handful of purple salal berries~
A bunch of purple berries are piled up here.~
Salal berries grow on small evergreen shrubs, both on the coast and
inland.  They tend to a dark purple colour, and resemble grapes somewhat,
though they are related to the blueberry family much more closely.  Small,
urn shaped flowers decorate the salal bush when the berries are not in
season, but they are rarely sold as decoration.

A Small Road~
A small dirt road winding through the plains meets with the sturdy
cobbles of the Arien Road at this point.  To the north, the broad, flat
plains stretch onward, while the waters of the Dantaron River flow to the
south.  Slightly downriver, a dock juts from the path of the road, and
rivermen ferry passengers across the waters.  Far to the west, the
beginnings of a thick forest clutter the horizon.

The Entrance to the Forest~
A wealth of shrubbery and undergrowth to the east suddenly gives way to a
wall of towering oak trees, their vast, leafy branches forming a green
ceiling to the wooded area.  Sunlight is filtered out, for the most part,
and shadows dominate the area.  A slight breeze whispers through the leaves
in the uppermost portions of the oaks.  A small dirt road leads into the
forest to the west, and out of the forest to the east.

A Bone Wagon~
This wagon seems somehow colder than outside, the nooks and crannies
filled with strangely resilient shadows.  Boxes filled with straw line the
floor, protecting neatly-arranged assortments of glass vials, each
containing a thick fluid of varying shades of dark red.  Some of the boxes
rattle drily.  The walls themselves are knitted from bones lashed together
with thick bands of iron wire.  They are meshed together surprisingly
tightly for such a variety of organic shapes, and little to no light reaches
into the wagon from outside.

A Dried Streambed~
A dried streambed winds its way through the forest, a sunken road lined
with stones and earth.  A slight trickle of water still runs along the
center of the streambed, causing a muddy patch to run through the dry earth.
On either side of the streambed, the thick moss carpet of the forest floor
resumes, and the towering oaks form a wall of trees.

A Dark Clearing~
The ancient trunks of the oaks part here to form a large clearing in the
woods.  Thick moss layers the ground, hiding the soil and giving a spongy
texture to the forest floor.  Ancient rocks jut from under the covering of
moss, painted gray and red by lichens.  The interlocking branches of trees
form a ceiling stretching over the large clearing, blocking most sunlight
from even this area.  The clearing continues east and south, and a small
break in the trees leads north.

A Break in the Dark Oaks~
The oak trees in this section of forest crowd together, forming
impassable walls in areas.  Ancient beards of lichen and moss dangle from
the twisted branches, and the bark is rough and black.  Gnarled roots
protrude from the carpet of moss lining the forest floor.  An eerie
screeching can be heard now and then, produced by interlocking branches and
trunks rubbing together.  Otherwise, the dark forest is silent, the crowding
trees seeming to stifle any noise.

The crowded, gnarled oak trees form a small clearing here, the
moss-coated floor of the forest harboring a small pool of rainwater. 
Overhead, interlocking branches creak as the trees shift slightly, and the
dangling beards of lichen quiver almost imperceptably.

A Trail in the Dark Forest~
A small trail winds its way between the dark oaks, beaten into the moss
by the repeated passage of feet.  Here and there along the trail, branches
are broken from the trees, or bark is stripped.  A slight rise to the east
pushes up through the forest floor, with lichen-coated rock edges thrusting
out of the moss.  In the face of the rise, a small dark crevice opens,
leading down into darkness.

A small crevice cut into the hillside by the actions of a long-ago

bark, brought into the crevice for unknown purposes.

Inside a Great Oak~
A large hollow in the enormous trunk of an ancient oak tree appears to
have been expanded through some natural means, as the inside walls show no
evidence of damage to the tree.  Inside the living tree, a snug habitation
has been formed.  A small mattress of springy vines, moss and leaves
occupies one side of the hollow.  Natural variations in the tree\@s wood
provide crude shelf space, upon which rest clay jugs and jars.

A Path Through the Trees~
A small path leads through the forest, worn into the moss-covered floor
of the woods.  Giant oaks tower all about, the upper leaves and branches
swishing slightly in a breeze.  The sunlight is mostly blocked by the
foliage overhead, and a pleasant green light is distilled to the forest
floor.

Inside a Great Oak~
The inside of the ancient oak tree has been hollowed through some natural
means, providing a large space used as a living area by the ethron.  The
smooth walls of living wood glow healthily, reflecting the light provided by
a wall hanging filled with luminous moss.  A bed of springy vines, moss and
leaves is arranged neatly to one side of the dwelling.

A Path Through the Trees~
A light path leads through the towering oaks, the rustling branches
overhead allowing spots of green-tinted sunlight to dance about.  The path
is lined with green moss, which creates a spongy carpet over the forest
floor.  The oak trees appear to have been tended, some branches trimmed and
other branches bound together with a pale green twine.  To the south and
west of the path stand enormous oaks with hollows in the massive trunks,
makeshift doors erected over the entrance.

A Break in the Trees~
The towering oaks that crowd around part slightly to the south of the
forest road, allowing access to a wider break in the dense foliage.  Thick
undergrowth hinders every step, and gray blankets of lichens hang from
ancient branches.  The forest continues to the south.

Inside a Great Oak~
A large hollow in the enormous trunk of an ancient oak tree appears to

has been formed.  A small mattress of springy vines, moss and leaves
occupies one side of the hollow.  Natural variations in the tree\@s wood

The Entrance to the Druids\@ Guild~
The natural corridor of the Eqiril clanhouse leads toward a small open
area to the north, a shady stand of trees rising above the younger saplings
forming the clanhouse walls.  The corridor of trees to the south runs east.

Within the Eqiril Clanhouse~
A natural corridor leading through the Eqiril clanhouse, the borders of
this open passageway are marked by walls of young saplings, clearly planted
and groomed for this very purpose.  Woven throughout the living walls are
vines and fresh boughs.  The floor of the clanhouse appears no different
than the rest of the forest, with spongy green moss lining the walkway.  The
corridor leads north and south.

The Eqiril Rangers\@ Guild~
A dense stand of trees rising above the younger saplings of the clanhouse
walls, the rangers\@ guild is a shady copse of oaks, splendid for rest,
contemplation, and the practice of arborial skills.  A slight breeze blows
through the limbs overhead, creating a peaceful rustling.  The clanhouse
continues to the south.

The Eqiril Druids\@ Guild~
A spacious copse of mighty oak trees towers above the heart of the Eqiril
clanhouse, marking the designated grounds of the druids\@ guild.  It is here
that the druids of the ethron circle come to meditate, practice nature\@s
arts, and commune with the forest.

An Open Meadow~
The living walls of the clanhouse spread into a wide circle, forming a
large open meadow filled with sunlight.  A fresh breeze blows through the
area, bringing with it the vibrant scents of the forest.  To the north of
the meadow stands an enormous oak tree, clearly a survivor of ancient times.
A large opening in the trunk is visible, appearing to be no more than a fold
of bark against the tree\@s mass.  A shop has been built into the base of a
large oak to the west.

Inside the Ancient Oak~
A large opening in the ancient oak\@s trunk allows entrance to a wide
hollow area, a small portion of the tree\@s girth and yet a spacious room. 
Rows of ridges growing from the smooth wood floor act as benches, and a
raised area to the east end of the hollow resembles a speaking stand.  The
walls of the hollow are decorated with sheets of dried bark, scribed with
histories, drawings, and maps.  A portion of the living oak wall has formed
into a spiral staircase leading upward.

the walls of which are decorated with paintings on dried bark.  The room
appears to be a council chamber, with portions of the living wooden floor
swelling to form large circular tables.  There is an air of grave importance
about the chamber.

A Small Pool of Water~
Amid the mighty trees of the Qilarn forest, a small pool of water springs
up through the mossy ground.  The pool is neatly lined with stones, and the
thin path leading back to the ethron village is well-marked.  The grass
around the pool seems to have been weeded and tended often.

A Musty Cave~
A musty, grimy stink of body sweat, animal hide, and peat smoke is heavy
in the air of this rough, narrow cave.  Torchlight plays feebly into the
room from the north, where the cave continues, casting dancing, flickering
shadows across the crude, stone-and-clay walls.  The room is bare for the
most part aside from some small bits of rag, discarded animal bones, and
other trash laying around in the corners.  A few disturbances can be seen in
the middle of the packed dirt floor, as if someone walked through recently. 
The rough stone walls meet in a peaked roof, getting lower and lower as the
cave tapers into nothing to the south.  A small wooden counter of
poorly-hewn planks has been cobbled together in the middle of the room.

A Warm and Musty Cave~
You are in a low, rough cave, walls dug from raw, dark stones embedded in
tenacious black clay.  Three torches have been planted in the walls,
guttering softly, and a basic wooden table sits before the firepit in the
center of the cave.  A wire rack has been set up over the pit, the black
metal coated with char accumulated from years of grilling.  A filthy rug,
made of coiled braids of fibrous inner tree bark, covers the floor, and
couple of sections of logs have been carved into chairs.  A musty smell
drifts from the main cave to the north, mingling with the earthy scent of the
forest and a faint, stale reek of body sweat and animal hide.  The ceiling
is low, part the natural, crude rock, and part fabricated from densely-woven
lathe overlaid with thick layers of bundled thatch.  Smoke escapes through a
small hole in the ceiling, wafting its way out into the forest.

A Small Fold in the Walls of the Oak~
Nestled in a large, natural fold in the walls of the living oak that
forms the Qilarn clanholt, this alcove is home to a jutting slab of speckled
green malachite which seems to spring from the very foundations of the
earth.  The spongy, verdant growth which covers the ground is even more
vivacious here, and the air is heady with the smells of spring and birth and
growing.  You may exit the crevice and enter the open meadow of the clanholt
to the east.
