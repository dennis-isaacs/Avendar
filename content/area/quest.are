Eqqila Ulmayon~
An elderly ethron woman stands here.
~
This thin and elderly ethron woman has a fern-green face lined with
wrinkles, but her large hazel eyes and sharp cheekbones hint at the great
beauty she possessed in times past.  Her hair is dark, though the roots are
greying.  Her finely curled locks fall in natural ringlets, like the wood
shavings of a carpenter.  Her bearing and manner is regally subdued, as of
one who commands hard-won insight and knowledge.  The sharp scent of
woodsmoke and pine perfume the air about her.

an imp sage~
A black-winged imp sage floats here.
~
This small, black imp has the leathery wings and scaly body that typify
most of its kind, but a number of things seem askew about the demon.  Most
noticeably, it wears a pair of miniature wire-rimmed spectacles, and rather
than being supported by the action of its wings, it floats due to the
influence of some magical spell.

The N\@jith is an aberration that could only fall under the dominion of Kyalee.
Finding that a whole hand is a might too much to swallow, the N\@jith will often settle for a finger.
A sprinkling of bone might suffice for the walls of the Orzub\@s prison.
The orzub is a hungry one, but I do think his favorite food is the entrails of scholars.
The Aklaju often employ orzub in situations where the body need not be disposed of neatly.
Diplomats often employ Djazith, but keeping them in tongues can be quite a bother.
The bloated ones are drawn to mud smeared in just the right way -- I think they may have simple tastes.
The spiny Qwablith\@s power lies within the constellation of the Logorin star.
I would say that the gharku had the heart of a bear, if the blood of an animal did not bind it.
The gharku swears fealty to the Aklaju, but I truly wonder if they know the source of their hieroglyph\@s power.
Like many of demonkind, the gharku loves the taste of cold iron.
The Kakrisc worm is one of Pricina\@s more amusing pets.
Control the Kakrisc worm with your own blood, applied liberally to the ground.
Give the Kakrisc a fresh head to feed on, and it will serve you well... for a time.
The hungry spirit knows no end to its desire, but it balks at the blood of the Firstborn.
Take care that the right entrails are strewn about before you conjure the devouring spirit. 
Nothing but the spirit of famine awaits you in the Maze.
The j\@nakra is rarely seen, but is easily bound by black yarrow.
A suitably interesting invisible trinket might be of interest to the j\@nakra.
The mysteries of Pnakur\@s lost cipher might help to unravel the secrets of the j\@nakra.

unusually strong pair of leathery wings.  For arms, it has miniature claws,
and its face has a typically demonic cast, complete with snapping
needle-sharp teeth.

This rubbery, grey demon is a filchling, one of the many breeds of

fingers, each with at least six digits.  Its feet are webbed, to allow for
quiet footfalls, and its tiny, whisper-thin wings that allow it to flutter

an ethereal shade~
An ethereal shade hovers here, lost in its memories.
~
Gently drifting about this place, this shade of one long since gone seems
absorbed in its own memories.  A pale, ghostly light seems to cling to its
ethereal form, visible only to your enhanced senses.  Though already
translucent, with each passing moment the wraith seems to grow slightly
fainter, as the memories binding it together are slowly dispersed back into
the aether.

a clawed Orzub~
A clawed Orzub stands here, ready to pounce.
~
Vaguely humanoid in its shape, the Orzub leans forward aggressively upon
its powerful, crouched legs.  Sleek, grey skin is drawn tightly about sinewy
muscles, allowing one to see the heavings of the demon\@s protruding rib
cage.  On either side, long, stick-like arms extend outwards, each one
ending in a razor-sharp, bony sickle that seems to have ripped its way out
from its fleshy cage.  Extending forward from the demon\@s face is a gaping,
canine jaw, lined with a double-layer of smashed, jagged incisors.  Bounding
forward with each step, the Orzub\@s claws seem to whistle through the air
with ominous speed.

short, squat legs, each one bent ever so slightly at the joint.  The legs
extend onward into bony, clawed feet.  

A seemingly human skull, wrapped tightly in grey, decaying skin, rests atop
a stick of a neck, protruding only slightly forward from its hulking torso. 
Its jaw is set into a permanent grin, jagged and broken teeth, thrusting
forth from shriveled lips.  Bloodshot eyestalks erupt from the gharku\@s
empty sockets, endlessly swinging about in search of prey.

j\@nakra ethereal minordemon minorbound demon imp imp-like form~
an ethereal j\@nakra~
An imp-like form seems to shimmer in and out of existence before you.
~
The thing before you is vaguely reminicent of an imp, albeit one larger
than its brethren.  The flesh of the j\@nakra is a sickly white hue, its
paleness implaceably unwholesome.  The limbs of the beast end in sets of
piercing and rending claws while its pinched, impish face sports a grinning
mouth of jagged bone spurs.  A pair of rapidly flapping wings support the
creature, the membranes of its bat-like members a strikingly unreflective
black.  Discerning these features is made all the more difficult by the
j\@nakra\@s only semi-visible nature.  

The j\@nakra never is fully visible, pieces of its body always seeming to
fade into the air.  Even as the limbs shimmer back into existance, others
fade creating an unsettling picture of semi-intagibility.  The beating of
its wings and the tittering of its deadly mouth suddenly cease on occasion
as the sources of the sound disappear, the ensuing quiet soon shattered as
its flesh continues its dance through the ether.

I once raised one of the Hounds of Abuha, but I grew tired of its constant need to feed on the entrails of potent animals.
No price is needed to feel the sting of the khudh\@itzu fly. 
Gorged on animal blood, a symbol made from it might contain entire swarms of khudh\@itzu flies. 
Eyes mirror the soul, so the Chaigian dopplegangers collect the eyes of potent beings avidly. 
You can always hear the khudh\@itzu in Xixyzr.
Vershak are very fonds of the skulls they collect.
The winged vershak is quite possibly the most normal of the denizens of Selb-Kar
Nvae\@gra are always in need of high quality iron to replenish their chains. 
The Nvae\@gra often serve as inquisitors in Logor, heating their chains to sear the flesh of their victims.
Burnt wood can contain the dreadful Khil\@Mestahn. 
In Xixyzr, the Khil\@Mestahn swarm like locusts through the darkness. 
Chitin is not enough for the Khil\@Mestahn -- it demands potent armor of mortal forging.
Sharper than the atthagth\@s sting is the star of Logor.  
Isetaton\@s minions might be yours, for only a thimble of salt. 
Isetaton\@s minions are most assuredly summoned by Isetaton\@s sign.
Servitors of Isetaton have many tentacles, but no hands. 
There is a horror in Logor that comes with twilight, and is only sated by feeding on the blood of large animals -- quite a delicacy in the void. 
Undead brick, undead bone, both bind the horror of Logor.
Even a demon queen has servants, and Pricina claims the succubi. 
The succubi always take their price from your own heart. 
The blood of the most holy of beings might be the only drink a succubi would refuse.

a hound of Abuha~
A large, wolf-like beast, jet-black and hairless, stalks along.
~
In form like a great, hairless wolf, the hound of Abuha stands fully
three feet at the shoulder, its muscular legs and back offset by its
emaciated, almost skeletal, rib cage, face and protruding spine.  The
beast\@s skin is black, and its eyes deep-set burning coals, as though the
conflagration which consumed its flesh now dwindled in those flickering
orbs.  Its long muzzle is thick with serrated teeth, which gleam white
against its snarling, jet-black jowls.

attack by latching on with their serrated claws, and then piercing the flesh
with their sharp probisci, which drain blood to fill the translucent bulb on
the fly\@s tail.  There are several dozen flies in this particular swarm.

Lengths of blackened and tarnished chain obscure, for the most part, the

serrated and cruelly barbed, draped over the demon\@s form give forth an
unsettling clatter as they swing dangerously about, running over and through
the Nvae\@gra\@s flesh, and drag along the ground.  

Beneath the shroud of iron, twin points of glowing red smoulder in the
sockets of a skull only partially covered by flesh.  Dark skin has peeled
away from the face of this creature, clinging to the lower jaw tautly,
attempting to hold fast to it\@s last, razor-toothed purchase.

An armor plated behemoth, a Khil\@Mestahn looms here.
~
A smaller cousin of the foul Khil\@ayum race, the Khil\@Mestahn stands a
mere twelve feet in height.  Thick plates of sickly green chitin cover the
beast, its armored hide fiercely spiked.  A pair of long, plated arms extend
from its body, each ending in a set of claws more reminicent of swords than
fingers.  An impossibly wide maw hangs slightly ajar, displaying rows of
razor teeth, below a set of black, doll-like eyes.  

The Khil-Mestahn plods along slowly, heavily.  The creatures breaths are
audible-sounding as a huge bellows, each exhalation accompanied by a
dripping of viscous saliva.  The doll-like eyes flicker, and then are calm
once more.

djinni djinn~
a djinni~
A djinni hovers here, at ease in the shifting winds.
~
The djinni holds the shape of a bald, well-muscled human from the waist
up, with a slender funnel cloud below in place of legs and feet.  He has an
impressively large, hooked nose, a stern jaw and unblinking sapphire eyes. 
The djinni\@s severe mouth is encircled by the lines of a trim black
moustache and beard.  Floating comfortably in his element, the djinni seems
unaffected by the buffeting winds, and he returns your look with a
challenging stare of his own.

You are in an unbound panorama of air, with no land visible in any
direction.  It seems that a very weak pull of gravity is focused all around
you, coming from many different directions at once, and that darkness and
light shift without any sun, moons, or stars to account for the change. 
Clouds in striations of every hue swirl and tumble in the distance, and the
wind whistles piercingly around you, tugging in one direction and then
another.  
~
>data_prog desc2~
Mist and haze enfold you in convoluted eddies and currents as you pass
through the elemental plane of air.  In the distance, vortexes of brilliant,
shifting color reel around twisting, gyrating clouds and massive cyclones of
smoky haze, all in a chaotic mottle of color, motion, and howling,
whispering, shrieking sounds.  Faint blurs of humanoid-like form meander in
the distance, weaving through the tempestuous billows.  
~
>data_prog desc3~
Dappled clouds and convoluting wreathes of mist and fog swirl about the
elemental plane of air.  Strong winds buffet you and disappear, replaced by
gentle zephyrs which in turn grow into howling gusts.  There is no downward
pull of gravity, and though light glows and recedes with the clouds and fog,
there are no suns nor moons to account for the illumination.  Unearthly,
piercing shrieks and deep, shuddering moans occasionally rise up over the
whistling of the wind, though it is unclear from what direction or source.  
~
>data_prog desc4~
Wind billows furiously around you, randomly shifting direction from
moment to moment.  In every direction, unending sky reaches out to the
limits of perception.  Tumbling, twisting clouds and funnels of smoke spin
in the distance, following unseen, erratic currents.  Your senses are
assaulted by a cacophony of moans, whistles, and howls, as well as fleeting
scents both wrenchingly foul and exotically fair.  
~
>data_prog desc5~
Meandering banks of many-hued clouds, wispy tendrils of swirling vapors,
and gyrating whirls of smoke surround you.  In the distance, vague humanoid
blurs weave along obscure currents to destinations unseen.  Great whirling
vortexes appear and disappear, accompanied by halos of jagged lightning. 
All around you, breezes spin, zephyrs tug and twist, and sudden gales
embrace you in frenetic blasts of air.

a chain-draped Nvae\@gra~
A gaunt, chain-shrouded figure stalks about.
~
Lengths of blackened and tarnished chain obscure, for the most part, the
gaunt figure of the Nvae\@gra.  Midnight-blue flesh is pulled over an inhuman
skeleton, drawn so tight that spurs of bone edge through.  The chains, links
serrated and cruelly barbed, draped over the demon\@s form give forth an
unsettling clatter as they swing dangerously about, running over and through
the Nvae\@gra\@s flesh, and drag along the ground.  

Beneath the shroud of iron, twin points of glowing red smoulder in the
sockets of a skull only partially covered by flesh.  Dark skin has peeled
away from the face of this creature, clinging to the lower jaw tautly,
attempting to hold fast to its last, razor-toothed purchase.

a Khil\@Mestahn~
An armor plated behemoth, a Khil\@Mestahn looms here.
~
A smaller cousin of the foul Khil\@ayum race, the Khil\@Mestahn stands a
mere twelve feet in height.  Thick plates of sickly green chitin cover the
beast, its armored hide fiercely spiked.  A pair of long, plated arms extend
from its body, each ending in a set of claws more reminicent of swords than
fingers.  An impossibly wide maw hangs slightly ajar, displaying rows of
razor teeth, below a set of black, doll-like eyes.  

The Khil-Mestahn plods along slowly, heavily.  The creatures breaths are
audible-sounding as a huge bellows, each exhalation accompanied by a
dripping of viscous saliva.  The doll-like eyes flicker, and then are calm
once more.

the spawn of Atthagth~
A demonic scorpion scuttles about, covered with black chitin.
~
A massive monstrosity of midnight chitin, the spawn of Atthagth resembles
some form of twisted scorpion.  A mad chittering emanates from the mass of
pitch plating as the demon scuttles about, the noise clawing at the corners
of your mind.  It carries itself on six legs, each many jointed limb covered
with the same barbed and serrated chitin.  A pair of massive pincers snap
idly, each easily as long as an ethron is tall.  Looking over the thing, you
note a curious lack of eyes.  What truly catches your eye, however, is the
tail.  

Atop a tail rising five feet, a wicked looking stinger is perched.  The
cruelly barbed point drips a vile crimson ichor as it twitches left and
right, seeking flesh.  The volume of the chittering seems to rise and fall
with the stingers movements.

A combination of features both horrific and beautiful, this initiate of
Pricina hovers before you on spined, batlike wings.  The succubus hovers
unclothed, her soft curves readily visible.  Visible too are her unnaturally
long fingers and toes, the digits elongating into piercing claws.  The flesh
of her hands and feet are black as pitch, a stark contrast to the skin of
milky white covering the rest of her body.  Where white flesh meets black,
the colors spatter into one another as they blend.  The skin of her face is
pulled tight over her skull, the gaunt appearance contrasting the pleasant
softness the rest of her body seems to have.  Her eyes also strike you as
unnatural, the pupils vertical slits, like a cats.  The eyes flash hungrily
as they dart, searching.

in utterly silence, and the only sign of any activity at all are its glowing

a giant ghal\@koth worm~
A giant ghal\@koth worm slithers about in a puddle of its own excretions.
~
The true length of this great worm is nearly impossible to tell, as the
countless windings of its body are too convoluted to gauge readily.  The
worm is divided into cylindrical segments, each formed by a sharp,
cartilaginous substance, which pulse and shudder in harmony with the
twisting of the beast.  Yellowish oil oozes from pores on the worm, and
collects in a viscous puddle beneath it.  

Its maw is wide enough to devour a horse, and is filled with row after row
of grinding, jagged teeth.  An eerie green phosphorescence grows on the
inside of its gullet, the byproduct of the worm\@s last meal.

Agduk Hunt Lord Scion greaterdemon greateroneshot~
Agduk~
Agduk, the Scion of Xthjich, gazes imperiously about the room.
~
Agduk is the Demonic Lord of the Hunt, birthed of Xthjich and the Succubi
Queen Pricina.  His form is roughly humanoid, but in the place of flesh, he
sports a spiked black exoskeleton, serving as an armored carapace.  Sharp,
finely honed blades of bone jut out from beneath his hands, each a dangerous
sword-like reaver.  The demon\@s face is a livid grey, and is stretched
tightly across his alien skull.  

His eyes are quick and alert, and have pupils slit like some great cat.  He
prowls as he moves, and occasionally darts toward his destination with an
alarming speed, completely unencumbered by his bulky armor.  Unlike most
demons, there is no foul smell associated with Agduk -- only an unnerving
olfactory stillness.

Barkja, also known as the Infernal Sage, is a tall, lanky demon, replete

Small pouches and reagant sacks cover his stick-like frame, along with an
exceedingly sinister collection of dissection knives.  Renowned even about

The bitter thorns of a simple plant have a pernicious affect on the Ghal\@koth.
Agduk\@s power is best accessed through his father\@s sign. 
The Hunter collects swords of unusual make or power.
Agduk loves nothing more than the slaughter of pure beings, and might be drawn by a suitable quantity of their blood.
True to its nature, the Gamalean sapling will flourish in ground sown with salt. 
Logor has a new Grand Vizier -- Vaeshir, the Demilich.
The Grand Vizier of Logor can be summoned, but expect a mighty price.
Pricina herself can be summoned with the greatest of rituals. 
Pricina loves to collect the hearts of her greatest lovers, often mortal adventurers of some repute.
The warriors of Chaigidon are legendary even in the Void.
What blood but the most powerful of the mightiest of mortal races could bind the warriors of Chaigidon?
The denizens of Chaigidon will only work for the finest of weapons. 
Khamurn himself does not respond to normal conjurations, but perhaps one of his syndics would.
Rare metals will do to bind the syndics of Khamurn. 
The denizens of Khamurn recognize one price -- a fee measured in gold.
Nyogthua often makes a pet of various unclean spirits.
What better to contain the unclean spirit than the blood of a powerful ch\@taren?
Unclean spirits love nothing better to nest inside the skulls of powerful adventurers.
Isetaton itself can assume the illusion of flesh if you know the Maze.
Isetaton\@s likeness requires the brainstuff of a powerful creature to be properly bound. 
Isetaton\@s coming was one of the gifts of Uzith-Hazhi.
Only the most delicious of entrails will satiate the Chez\@lnith.

gamalean sapling tree malignant greaterdemon greateroneshot~
the Gamalean Sapling~
A malignant tree with moist, fleshy bark protrudes from the ground here.
~
The black and riven offshoot of some ghastly tree protrudes from the
ground here, forming a tapering, scabrous stem which rises some thirty feet
into the air.  The bark of the malignant plant has both the color and
texture of charred flesh - a tortured network of ebon ridges which writhe
atop a tender, pink interior.  The gnarled skin is studded here and there
with ruddy, weeping ulcers, in each of which gathers a putrid-smelling,
crimson sediment.  Several large lumps can also be seen beneath this carnal
membrane, slowly inching their way upward.  Closer inspection reveals these
to be detritus from a variety of corpses - a skull here, a pelvic bone
there, and even an entire humanoid form enveloped in one gluttonous bulge,
part of its dead face leering blankly from a rent in bark.  

The tree itself bears several branches, which extend from the main bole at
irregular intervals.  These naked limbs, slender as willow-wands, rise from
the tree and then hang downwards at their tips, appearing for all the world
like the fleshy rods of some diabolic angler.  And the gruesome catch of
dead things, now shorn of skin and muscle, passes along these limbs to hang,
then drop, like ripe fruit, to the ground below, forming a wide annulus of
carrion about the tree\@s base.  

At the very apex of the demon tree hangs a bulbous nodule; a small, sickly
fruit, its translucent skin a deep, asphyxiated purple.

notVaeshir~
Vaeshir the demilich, Grand Vizier of Logor, floats here.
~
The demilich Vaeshir floats here, its form an ebony skull wreathed in an
ethereal blue flame.  One of the most powerful forms of undead, the demilich
before you contains is all that remains of the physical form of the archmage
Vaeshir, tied through mystic bonds to his dreadful spirit.  Unthinkably
powerful and intelligent, the demilich emanates and aura of fear and dread,
cloaking itself in black magic.  Its skull is free from any sign of decay or
age, and it almost seem to grin, its teeth replaced with flawless fire
opals.  

Vaeshir is the Grand Vizier of Logor, and rules that demon city from its
Iron Throne.  Once a powerful archmage, Vaeshir became a demilich, and
subverted the dark prophecy of the then Grand Vizier Chagrob to his own
ends.  Promising the demon lord that a demilich would sit once more on the
Iron Throne in a year\@s time, Vaeshir returned with power and took the
throne for himself.

perverse delight in the simplest of sensations, her hands caressing

in her pale features are her eyes, which are marked with pupils which open

Vaeshir~
Vaeshir the demilich, Grand Vizier of Logor, floats here.
~
The demilich Vaeshir floats here, its form an ebony skull wreathed in an
ethereal blue flame.  One of the most powerful forms of undead, the demilich
before you contains is all that remains of the physical form of the archmage
Vaeshir, tied through mystic bonds to his dreadful spirit.  Unthinkably
powerful and intelligent, the demilich emanates an aura of fear and dread,
cloaking itself in black magic.  Its skull is free from any sign of decay or
age, and it almost seems to grin, its teeth replaced with flawless fire
opals.  

Vaeshir is the Grand Vizier of Logor, and rules that demon city from its
Iron Throne.  Once a powerful archmage, Vaeshir became a demilich, and
subverted the dark prophecy of the then Grand Vizier Chagrob to his own
ends.  Promising the demon lord that a demilich would sit once more on the
Iron Throne in a year\@s time, Vaeshir returned with power and took the
throne for himself.

a Logorin taskmaster~
A mass of black-fleshed muscle, a Logorian taskmaster glares sternly.
~
A hideous being of twisted, veined muscle lurches here, radiating a sense
of power and authority.  Its skin is a sickly, glazed black, and dotted with
faint scarring remnants of sores.  Its entire front bulges outwards with
hairless muscle, scarred with scabbed-over wounds of various size and depth.
Its arms, thick and powerful, extend from his sides, each clutching a
several-headed whip of razor-sharp barbs and thin-wired tips.  Its lower
body descends into two potent-looking limbs of the same black flesh, which
hook backwards in a way similar to that of a goat.  

His head is a most horrific perversion of nature itself.  Thick and bulbous,
it embodies the characteristics of an assortment of animal-forms, and yet
never seems to decide on one for certain.  Instead, the form of the head
twists and writhes upon itself, removing eyes, replacing snouts, and closing
over gills continously as it glares about its surroundings.  Although never
settling upon a single form for more than an instant, one thing is constant;
the taskmaster\@s visage remains hideous in the extreme.

An insectoid syndic of Khamurn stands here silently.

Standing over eight feet tall, this insectoid syndic of the demon
magistrate Khamurn is well suited to its normal duties in the defense and
organization of Khamurn\@s court.  The demon has a sticklike, insectoid body,
complete with four independent arms.  Covering its body is a hard green
exoskeleton, and prehensile pincer-like hands are located at the end of each
of its lanky arms.  

Along with its blood-red compound eyes, the syndic has an impressive bundle
of antennas sprouting from the two nodes on its head.  The creature is
largely free of superfluous motion, except the constant twitching of the
antennae in response to otherworldly stimuli.  It wears no formal armor, but
is draped in fine purple silks of its office.  Each of its arms bears either
a sword or a shield, which it holds at ready.

The wispy darkness before you seems to twist of its own accord, heedless
of prevailing winds.  The black mist that forms the unclean spirit lashes

Isetaton slithering avatar sultan demon greaterdemon greaterbound~
Isetaton~
The slithering avatar of the demon sultan Isetaton floats languidly here.
~
Isetaton is known to have many names and countless obscene shapes, but no
form of the Demon Sultan is more well known than his essence as the
slithering avatar.  On first glance, his form appears to be roughly humanoid
-- but closer examination yields a being in large part, if not wholely,
alien to this plane of existence.  Small worm-like tentacles dot his body,
grey worms covered with sucker-like protuberances.  Breaking the integrity
of his flesh, jaws both large and small clatter noisily as Isetaton floats
about the room.  Thin eyestalks which sprout from around his neck scan all
directions about the demon, while the eyes set in the center of his face are
little more than blackened orbs.

a handmaiden of Tzakmeqiel~
A handmaiden of Tzakmeqiel the Desecrator burbles to herself.
~
This handmaiden of Tzakmeqiel is mostly a lump of bloated flesh.  She
moves by propelling her lower, blob-like body along a trail of slick mucus,
while the vestigates of a head and torso are supported by the mounds of fat.
A nauseating reek bubbles up from her depths, following the pulsing and
roiling of distended tissue.  

More horribly, the handmaiden\@s skin is obviously diseased, and, in some
cases, putrefying.  Boils crisscross her face and neck, while plague sores
are omnipresent.  Oozing, never healing wounds open and close in time with
her burbling motion, and the handmaiden\@s eyes are a jaundiced yellow.  The
demon speaks rarely, pausing to wretch up the contents of her stomach
between belching forth curses and insults at nothing in particular.

A grotesque, bulbous C\@thsa spawnling thrashes about.
~
A bulbous, grublike worm, this C\@thsa spawnling is several feet long. 
Banded in chitinous armor, the demon is featureless but for a snarling,
dripping mouth filled with jagged, cruel teeth.  The armored plates clatter
together horribly, grinding and screeching.  A wet trail seems to follow the
worm about.

A mangled, chitinous fragment of a C\@thsa worm writhes in agony, bleeding ichor.
~
A lesser entity of the dark world Yra, this fragment of an enormous worm
flails about in agony, severed at one end and bleeding ichor profusely from
many gaping wounds.  Many of the dense, armored scales are rent and
shattered, soft, pale unflesh quivering beneath.  A many-toothed maw gapes
in one end, slack and soft.  A sickening, rotten air follows the demon
about, and mucus drips with a soft hissing.

A cloud of sickly yellow fog floats here.
~
A cloud of thick, foggy mist floats here, its color a shade of sickly
yellow.  You can catch faint flickers of motion within the cloud, prompting
closer examination.  

As you peer into the cloud, you see odd translucent things moving within the
suffocating mist.  Small, ghostly jaws dance within the cloud, snapping
hungrily and silently as they wink in and out of existance.  The eddies and
currents within the fog seem to carry the phantom mouths about in a
haphazard fashion as they desperately seek flesh to rend and consume.

Magnani, the Greathearted~
A purple-skinned being with three legs and one arm stands here.
~
This odd being is unlike anything you have seen before.  Three humanoid
legs support its frame with two in front, as per usual aside from a mild
bow-leggedness, and a third arching from the lower back.  The torso is
basically normal in shape, but the features make it confusing to discern as
to the sex of the creature.  A single, long arm grows from the center just
below the chest, and is equiped with two elbow-like joints.  The being\@s
head is a sort of rounded triangular shape with a few slits that must be its
nose and two pupilless white eyes about the size and shape of an asjiena
fruit.

Carved from pure grey marble and marked with mystical runes, this vault
is an enormous room, easily large enough to hold a stone giant, or even a
dragon.  Supported by enormous tons of stone, the Vault appears designed to
survive a very large amount of punishment.  The once-pristine marble is
scorched a pure ash-black, coated with a thick layer of grimy cinders. 
Long, rent cracks in the stone issue wisps of smoke from time to time, and
each rune glows with renewed spiritlight.  The floor is oddly smooth and
unhurt, the glassy surface now polished to a mirror finish.  To the north, 
a charred archway leads out onto the open, ruined dome.

a stocky shuddeni guard~
A stocky shuddeni dressed in heavy chainmail prowls here.
~
An older shuddeni, this guard is rather stockier and sturdier than most
of his race.  His pale grey skin is sallow and loose, hanging in folds. 
Blackened teeth and bloodless lips are twisted in a near-permanent grimace,
and his eyesockets are tattooed with some obscene symbols in dark blue ink.

the abominable polytope~
An enormous black cloud hangs in the air here, shrouding the presence of some abominable creature.
~
A horrendous black cloud hangs here, shrouding the visage of some
abominable creature.  This thing inside the cloud ..  Is not.  Scarcely
organic, the demon is more animate geometry than any being shaped from flesh
and bone.  The monstrosity flexes and pulsates as it rotates through the
surface layers of the cloud.  Flickering, disconnected joints dance about
the edges of this alien polytope, their lines jagged and degrees obscene. 
The pattern made by the the thing would be mesmerizing, save for the brutal
fact that to look into this being is to look into madness.

A blind human stands here imperiously, tattooed head to foot.

This short human is tattooed from head to foot in a spreading, curling
network of whorls and spirals.  The severe designs make his skin seem a
charcoal grey, and his eyes have been cruelly gouged out.  The scars are
cauterized into deep depressions, combining with his dusky skin to give him
a decidedly shuddeni-esque appearance.

A gaunt caladaran scholar, wrapped in scorched bandages, leans on his staff.
~
This scholar is painfully thin, even for one of a usually-slender race. 
His sticklike arms and legs are wrapped in yellowed bandages which crackle
stiffly; they seem scorched around the edges.  His head seems badly burnt;
it features a mass of scars, and all hair has long since been seared away. 
The dancing orange light of some unseen fire is reflected in -- or shows
through -- his deep-set, dark eyes.

Standing over seven feet in height, this metal construct is composed of
an intricate array of clockwork, springs, gears, and chains, all shielded by
iron plates.  It clanks with each step it takes, emitting whirring sounds as
it swivels its hollow eyes back and forth.  In the center of the golem\@s
chest cavity is a mass of darkness, a blackness which seems to drink in the
ambient light.  Each of its two arms terminate in a series of spikes
connected by chains to its core; it appears as though the spikes are capable
of extending and snapping back into place in rapid succession.

mpforce ham_reynaldo say My lord, I did intend it.
mpforce ham_polonius say Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
mpforce ham_polonius say Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;

mpforce ham_polonius say As are companions noted and most known

mpforce ham_reynaldo say My lord, that would dishonour him.
mpforce ham_polonius say \@Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge

mpforce ham_polonius say Wherefore should you do this?
2
mpforce ham_reynaldo say Ay, my lord,
mpforce ham_reynaldo say I would know that.
mpforce ham_polonius say Marry, sir, here\@s my drift;
mpforce ham_polonius say And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
mpforce ham_polonius say You laying these slight sullies on my son,
mpforce ham_polonius say As \@twere a thing a little soil\@d i\@ the working, Mark you,

mpforce ham_polonius say According to the phrase or the addition
mpforce ham_polonius say Of man and country.
mpforce ham_reynaldo say Very good, my lord.
mpforce ham_polonius say And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
mpforce ham_polonius say about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
mpforce ham_polonius say something: where did I leave?
mpforce ham_reynaldo say At \@closes in the consequence,\@ at \@friend or so,\@
mpforce ham_reynaldo say and \@gentleman.\@
mpforce ham_polonius say At \@closes in the consequence,\@ ay, marry;
mpforce ham_polonius say He closes thus: \@I know the gentleman;
mpforce ham_polonius say I saw him yesterday, or t\@ other day,
mpforce ham_polonius say Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
mpforce ham_polonius say There was a\@ gaming; there o\@ertook in\@s rouse;
mpforce ham_polonius say There falling out at tennis:\@ or perchance,

mpforce ham_ophelia say My lord, I do not know;

mpforce ham_ophelia say And, with his other hand thus o\@er his brow,

mpforce ham_ophelia say And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
2
mpforce ham_ophelia say He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
mpforce ham_ophelia say As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
mpforce ham_ophelia say And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
mpforce ham_ophelia say And, with his head over his shoulder turn\@d,
mpforce ham_ophelia say He seem\@d to find his way without his eyes;
mpforce ham_ophelia say For out o\@ doors he went without their helps,
mpforce ham_ophelia say And, to the last, bended their light on me.

mpforce ham_polonius say This is the very ecstasy of love,

mpforce ham_polonius say Whose violent property fordoes itself

mpforce ham_polonius say As oft as any passion under heaven
mpforce ham_polonius say That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
mpforce ham_polonius say What, have you given him any hard words of late?
mpforce ham_ophelia say No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
2
mpforce ham_ophelia say I did repel his fetters and denied
mpforce ham_ophelia say His access to me.
mpforce ham_polonius say That hath made him mad.
mpforce ham_polonius say I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
mpforce ham_polonius say I had not quoted him: I fear\@d he did but trifle,

2

mpforce ham_ghost say Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
mpforce ham_ghost say But this eternal blazon must not be

mpforce ham_ghost say If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
mpforce ham_hamlet say O God!
mpforce ham_ghost say Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Murder!
mpforce ham_ghost say Murder most foul, as in the best it is;

mpforce ham_hamlet say Haste me to know\@t, that I, with wings as swift

mpforce ham_ghost say I find thee apt;
mpforce ham_ghost say And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
mpforce ham_ghost say That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
mpforce ham_ghost say Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
mpforce ham_ghost say \@Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
mpforce ham_ghost say A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
mpforce ham_ghost say Is by a forged process of my death
mpforce ham_ghost say Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
2
mpforce ham_ghost say The serpent that did sting thy father\@s life
mpforce ham_ghost say Now wears his crown.
mpforce ham_hamlet say O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
mpforce ham_ghost say Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
mpforce ham_ghost say With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
mpforce ham_ghost say O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
mpforce ham_ghost say So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
mpforce ham_ghost say The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
mpforce ham_ghost say O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
mpforce ham_ghost say From me, whose love was of that dignity
mpforce ham_ghost say That it went hand in hand even with the vow
mpforce ham_ghost say I made to her in marriage, and to decline
2
mpforce ham_ghost say Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
mpforce ham_ghost say To those of mine!
mpforce ham_ghost say But virtue, as it never will be moved,
mpforce ham_ghost say Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
mpforce ham_ghost say So lust, though to a radiant angel link\@d,
mpforce ham_ghost say Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
mpforce ham_ghost say And prey on garbage.
mpforce ham_ghost say But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
mpforce ham_ghost say Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
mpforce ham_ghost say My custom always of the afternoon,
mpforce ham_ghost say Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
mpforce ham_ghost say With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
mpforce ham_ghost say And in the porches of my ears did pour
mpforce ham_ghost say The leperous distilment; whose effect
mpforce ham_ghost say Holds such an enmity with blood of man
mpforce ham_ghost say That swift as quicksilver it courses through
mpforce ham_ghost say The natural gates and alleys of the body,
mpforce ham_ghost say And with a sudden vigour doth posset
mpforce ham_ghost say And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
mpforce ham_ghost say The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
mpforce ham_ghost say And a most instant tetter bark\@d about,
mpforce ham_ghost say Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
mpforce ham_ghost say All my smooth body.
mpforce ham_ghost say Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother\@s hand
mpforce ham_ghost say Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch\@d:
mpforce ham_ghost say Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
mpforce ham_ghost say Unhousel\@d, disappointed, unanel\@d,
mpforce ham_ghost say No reckoning made, but sent to my account
mpforce ham_ghost say With all my imperfections on my head:
mpforce ham_ghost say O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
mpforce ham_ghost say If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
2
mpforce ham_ghost say Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
mpforce ham_ghost say A couch for luxury and damned incest.
mpforce ham_ghost say But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
mpforce ham_ghost say Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
mpforce ham_ghost say Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
mpforce ham_ghost say And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
mpforce ham_ghost say To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
mpforce ham_ghost say The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,

mpforce ham_claudius say Have we, as \@twere with a defeated joy,--
mpforce ham_claudius say With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
mpforce ham_claudius say With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
mpforce ham_claudius say In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
mpforce ham_claudius say Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr\@d
mpforce ham_claudius say Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
mpforce ham_claudius say With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
mpforce ham_claudius say Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
mpforce ham_claudius say Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
2
mpforce ham_claudius say Or thinking by our late dear brother\@s death
mpforce ham_claudius say Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
mpforce ham_claudius say Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
mpforce ham_claudius say He hath not fail\@d to pester us with message,
2
mpforce ham_claudius say Importing the surrender of those lands
mpforce ham_claudius say Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
mpforce ham_claudius say To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
mpforce ham_claudius say Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
mpforce ham_claudius say Thus much the business is: we have here writ
mpforce ham_claudius say To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
mpforce ham_claudius say Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
mpforce ham_claudius say Of this his nephew\@s purpose,--to suppress
mpforce ham_claudius say His further gait herein; in that the levies,
mpforce ham_claudius say The lists and full proportions, are all made
mpforce ham_claudius say Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
mpforce ham_claudius say You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
mpforce ham_claudius say For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
mpforce ham_claudius say Giving to you no further personal power

mpforce ham_claudius say You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
mpforce ham_claudius say And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
mpforce ham_claudius say That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
mpforce ham_claudius say The head is not more native to the heart,
mpforce ham_claudius say The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
mpforce ham_claudius say Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
mpforce ham_claudius say What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
2
mpforce ham_laertes say My dread lord,
mpforce ham_laertes say Your leave and favour to return to France;
mpforce ham_laertes say From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
mpforce ham_laertes say To show my duty in your coronation,
mpforce ham_laertes say Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
2
mpforce ham_laertes say My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
mpforce ham_laertes say And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
mpforce ham_claudius say Have you your father\@s leave? What says Polonius?
mpforce ham_polonius say He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
2
mpforce ham_polonius say By laboursome petition, and at last
mpforce ham_polonius say Upon his will I seal\@d my hard consent:
mpforce ham_polonius say I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
mpforce ham_claudius say Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
mpforce ham_claudius say And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
mpforce ham_claudius say But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
mpforce ham_hamlet esay \@says, aside,\@ A little more than kin, and less than kind.
mpforce ham_claudius say How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
mpforce ham_hamlet say Not so, my lord; I am too much i\@ the sun.
mpforce ham_gertrude say Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
mpforce ham_gertrude say And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
2
mpforce ham_gertrude say Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
mpforce ham_gertrude say Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
mpforce ham_gertrude say Thou know\@st \@tis common; all that lives must die,
mpforce ham_gertrude say Passing through nature to eternity.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Ay, madam, it is common.
2
mpforce ham_gertrude say If it be,
mpforce ham_gertrude say Why seems it so particular with thee?
mpforce ham_hamlet say Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not \@seems.\@
mpforce ham_hamlet say \@Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
mpforce ham_hamlet say Nor customary suits of solemn black,
mpforce ham_hamlet say Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
mpforce ham_hamlet say No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
mpforce ham_hamlet say Nor the dejected \@havior of the visage,
mpforce ham_hamlet say Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
mpforce ham_hamlet say That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
mpforce ham_hamlet say For they are actions that a man might play:
mpforce ham_hamlet say But I have that within which passeth show;
mpforce ham_hamlet say These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
mpforce ham_claudius say \@Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
mpforce ham_claudius say To give these mourning duties to your father:
mpforce ham_claudius say But, you must know, your father lost a father;
mpforce ham_claudius say That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
mpforce ham_claudius say In filial obligation for some term
mpforce ham_claudius say To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
mpforce ham_claudius say In obstinate condolement is a course
mpforce ham_claudius say Of impious stubbornness; \@tis unmanly grief;
mpforce ham_claudius say It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
mpforce ham_claudius say A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
mpforce ham_claudius say An understanding simple and unschool\@d:
2
mpforce ham_claudius say For what we know must be and is as common
mpforce ham_claudius say As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
mpforce ham_claudius say Why should we in our peevish opposition
mpforce ham_claudius say Take it to heart? Fie! \@tis a fault to heaven,
mpforce ham_claudius say A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
mpforce ham_claudius say To reason most absurd: whose common theme
mpforce ham_claudius say Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
mpforce ham_claudius say From the first corse till he that died to-day,
mpforce ham_claudius say \@This must be so.\@ We pray you, throw to earth
mpforce ham_claudius say This unprevailing woe, and think of us
mpforce ham_claudius say As of a father: for let the world take note,
mpforce ham_claudius say You are the most immediate to our throne;
mpforce ham_claudius say And with no less nobility of love
mpforce ham_claudius say Than that which dearest father bears his son,
mpforce ham_claudius say Do I impart toward you. For your intent
mpforce ham_claudius say In going back to school in Wittenberg,
mpforce ham_claudius say It is most retrograde to our desire:
mpforce ham_claudius say And we beseech you, bend you to remain
mpforce ham_claudius say Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
mpforce ham_claudius say Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
mpforce ham_gertrude say Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
mpforce ham_gertrude say I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
mpforce ham_hamlet say I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
mpforce ham_claudius say Why, \@tis a loving and a fair reply:
mpforce ham_claudius say Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
mpforce ham_claudius say This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
mpforce ham_claudius say Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,

mpforce ham_marcellus say My good lord--
mpforce ham_hamlet say I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
mpforce ham_hamlet say But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
mpforce ham_horatio say A truant disposition, good my lord.
mpforce ham_hamlet say I would not hear your enemy say so,
mpforce ham_hamlet say Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,

mpforce ham_hamlet say Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
mpforce ham_hamlet say Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
mpforce ham_hamlet say My father!--methinks I see my father.
mpforce ham_horatio say Where, my lord?
mpforce ham_hamlet say In my mind\@s eye, Horatio.
mpforce ham_horatio say I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
mpforce ham_hamlet say He was a man, take him for all in all,
mpforce ham_hamlet say I shall not look upon his like again.
mpforce ham_horatio say My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Saw? who?
mpforce ham_horatio say My lord, the king your father.
mpforce ham_hamlet say The king my father!
mpforce ham_horatio say Season your admiration for awhile
mpforce ham_horatio say With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
mpforce ham_horatio say Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
mpforce ham_horatio say This marvel to you.
mpforce ham_hamlet say For God\@s love, let me hear.
mpforce ham_horatio say Two nights together had these gentlemen,
mpforce ham_horatio say Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
mpforce ham_horatio say In the dead vast and middle of the night,
mpforce ham_horatio say Been thus encounter\@d. A figure like your father,
mpforce ham_horatio say Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
mpforce ham_horatio say Appears before them, and with solemn march
mpforce ham_horatio say Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk\@d
mpforce ham_horatio say By their oppress\@d and fear-surprised eyes,
mpforce ham_horatio say Within his truncheon\@s length; whilst they, distilled
mpforce ham_horatio say Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
mpforce ham_horatio say Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
mpforce ham_horatio say In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
mpforce ham_horatio say And I with them the third night kept the watch;
mpforce ham_horatio say Where, as they had deliver\@d, both in time,
mpforce ham_horatio say Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
mpforce ham_horatio say The apparition comes: I knew your father;
mpforce ham_horatio say These hands are not more like.
mpforce ham_hamlet say But where was this?
mpforce ham_marcellus say My lord, upon the platform where we watch\@d.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Did you not speak to it?
mpforce ham_horatio say My lord, I did;
mpforce ham_horatio say But answer made it none: yet once methought
mpforce ham_horatio say It lifted up its head and did address
mpforce ham_horatio say Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
mpforce ham_horatio say But even then the morning cock crew loud,
mpforce ham_horatio say And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
mpforce ham_horatio say And vanish\@d from our sight.
mpforce ham_hamlet say \@Tis very strange.
mpforce ham_horatio say As I do live, my honour\@d lord, \@tis true;
2
mpforce ham_horatio say And we did think it writ down in our duty
mpforce ham_horatio say To let you know of it.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Hold you the watch to-night?
2
mpforce ham_marcellus say We do, my lord.
mpforce ham_bernardo say We do, my lord.

2
mpforce ham_marcellus say My lord, from head to foot.
mpforce ham_bernardo say My lord, from head to foot.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Then saw you not his face?
mpforce ham_horatio say O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
mpforce ham_hamlet say What, look\@d he frowningly?
mpforce ham_horatio say A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Pale or red?
mpforce ham_horatio say Nay, very pale.
mpforce ham_hamlet say And fix\@d his eyes upon you?
mpforce ham_horatio say Most constantly.
mpforce ham_hamlet say I would I had been there.
mpforce ham_horatio say It would have much amazed you.
mpforce ham_hamlet say Very like, very like. Stay\@d it long?

mpforce ham_marcellus say Longer, longer.
mpforce ham_bernardo say Longer, longer.
mpforce ham_horatio say Not when I saw\@t.
mpforce ham_hamlet say His beard was grizzled--no?
mpforce ham_horatio say It was, as I have seen it in his life,
mpforce ham_horatio say A sable silver\@d.
mpforce ham_hamlet say I will watch to-night;
mpforce ham_hamlet say Perchance \@twill walk again.
mpforce ham_horatio say I warrant it will.
mpforce ham_hamlet say If it assume my noble father\@s person,

mpforce ham_hamlet say Let it be tenable in your silence still;
mpforce ham_hamlet say And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
mpforce ham_hamlet say Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
mpforce ham_hamlet say I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:

A small length of carved crystal lies here.~
Widow-sorrow.  Crystal of Testing.  Warrior\@s Doom.  The Death-Walk. 
Gauntlet of Dream.  

Over the centuries, this device has born many names.  But ancient lore yet
preserves the first name, from ancient alatharya: the Yaoye.  

One of the few remaining artifacts of the ancient alatharya still in mortal
hands, this device is said to have been imbued with the power to control and
shape a portion of the dream realm, shaping the landscape and the dwellers
into various forms that serve as a deadly trial-at-arms.  

The original purpose is lost in time, but it has been used variously as a
disposal and execution-tool, a proving or testing-ground for the strongest
of warriors, and as a focus of study for those scholars pursuing knowledge
of ancient arcana.  And of course as a represetation of wealth, for a
still-functioning artifact of the ancients is the rarest of rare magics in
Avendar.  

The earliest provenance is also lost in time.  But it is known by
lore-masters that it was, centuries after the Sundering, in possession of
the aelin, and held in a great fortress in the Cloudrim City of Phoedina by
aelin wizard-guardians.  It was stolen from them by by the shuddeni
mater-thief Rnaiksa, in the decades following the first aelin-shuddeni
commerce, rememberd by aelin as Ad Ephou Padel, or the Gread Deception.  And
it remained in Shuddeni hands, passing from Sept to Sept in a frenzy of
greed and blood, until it was taken from them by Ch\@taren during the War of
Night.  

It has remained since in the ch\@taren haven of the waves, Jh\@ten, guarded by
the Spiritlords of Shelratha for a time, and then used in the tower of
Ys\@Raiva for the training of the most advanced spirit templars and mages of
Jh\@ten.

** A clay tablet dating a few years after the War of Night is here.  It
is partially cracked.  **

Missive to the Nsaia, from Caerlath - On the Yaoye Crystal 

On the fourth item from the Ksatha takings, that is, the small crystal
seized from the black priests of the Ksatha in the battle of Ianiair Thema:
It is a small and strange sculpture of pure, clear crystal.  Nearly a
handspan in length, its form is most irregular, with odd twists and bends,
save for one clear facet in which cloudy images of distant and strange
landscapes can be seen.  These landscapes change from time to time.  

Our studies determined that it was not of demonic or otherwise tainted
origins, and so it was preserved.  Further study determined that it was, of
all the objects seized, by far the most powerful and ancient, and scholars
from the Earendam libraries to the White Castle were discreetly consulted as
to lore surrounding it.  

It was eventually learned that this was none other than the Yaoye, one of
the most potent artifacts of the ancient alatharya to survive the sundering
and remain in mortal hands.  It was once kept by aelin, but was stolen from
them in years prior to the great wars.  

According to lore, the ancient alatharyan enchanters fashioned this to serve
as a focus for a small region in the plane of dreams.  They would then use
this region for trials at arms.  One common trial was that of the miscreant,
guilty of misdeeds.  If such a one survived the \#walk\#, passing through the
gauntlet of dream-fashioned creatures and dangers to emerge living, they
were deemed to have been sufficiently punished by the Gods.  

Ys\@raiva trainers have been given the crystal to aid in their work, at their
request, and with my and Acraeihii\@s approval.  It is a danger, but true
training must be dangerous, lest we fall to weakness when strength and skill
are most needed.

chapter1~
Vakalis is one of the lesser domains of the void.  It is a place of dark,
blasted ground, riddled with warrens and shallow tunnels.  The ruins of some
city, often called by the name of the place, squats in a central hollow.  

Almost exclusively, Vakalis is populated by imps.  Little enough is there to
draw larger classes of demons, so the imps, traditionally at the bottom of
the infernal pecking order, infested the place, and spend their time
bickering over obscure matters of hierarchy.  

The imps common in a diverse array of types, being specialized to various
functions.  They are most commonly in the service of greater demonic powers,
but, as we shall see, can be quite useful when conjured by mortal scholars,
typically called by lesser rituals of power.  
~
E
chapter2~
The most basic, or common (the distinction seems superfluous) sort of imp
is called by the name of the region.  The Vakalic imp is typically green,
with small, functioning wings, and sharp claws.  

Often used as messengers by demonic overlords, the Vakalic imp can be
favorably employed by mortal scholars as well.  Due to their connection to
the void, such imps can travel great distances in a short span of time, and
can be cajoled into transporting items or messages by skilled mages.  

True to their names, the Vakalic imps are conjured through the use of the
Vakalic sign, inscribed in charcoal.  They are quite fond of mortal
clothing, and will often perform their task for a simple set of shoes. 
(There is no accounting for the vanities of imps!)  
~
E
chapter3~
Another commonly occurring species of imp is the so-called filchling. 
Reviled even among imps, they often occupy the bottom of what passes for
social structure among the imps.  This is primarily a result of their
skulking, sneaking nature, and their absolutely obsession with hoarding any
valuables they can in their jealously guarded warrens.  

Their main function is as scouts of spies for competing for whichever other
imp or other powerful demon who can buy their favor.  We of mortal flesh can
bind the demons to do what is perhaps their true calling -- theft.

powdered silver.  True to their natures, they typically demand jewelry to
satisfy their never-ending lust for precious metals.

chapter4~
Rarer among imps are those of their number who have learned a smattering
of matters arcane.  They are typically more intelligent than their brother
imps, which either leads them to these additional powers, or have developed
wit as a result of this magic.  Because of both these traits, they are
almost always powerful within imp society, with many subservient imps
reporting to them.  

These imp sages also occur outside of Vakalis, and often in the service at
the courts of various demon lords.  We mortals can take advantage of these
imp sages when we summon them, often obtaining valuable information about
exotic items or personages.  

Unlike most of their brethren, imp sages are not bound by the Vakalic sign. 
Fancying themselves more intelligent and powerful than normal imps, they
have become ensnared by the powers of the Aklaju Hieroglyph, engraved with
lines of black charcoal.  Mercenary in nature, they will often demand a
price in gold coins.

You gaze upon Vakalis, demesnes of the imps.  Countless of their number
move in pulsing and throbbing hordes through warrens which lead to a
decaying city on the surface.  

Of all shapes and sizes, the imps chatter at each other, the combination of
their voices combining in mad harmony.  Imps are called away by larger
demons to serve, and establish a rigid pecking order which is more than
apparent in their constant and often violent behavior towards each other.  

No exit seems to lead from Vakalis, but burned in the lifeless ground near
the place is a symbolic, which can only be the fabled Vakalic sign.  Imps
cluster about it, worshipping it.  

Inexorably, the view within the cube draws you to the Sign, and it expands
to fill the entire image.  Transfixed, you are unable to look away as it
burns itself into your mind, warping your very soul by its presence.

The Theory and Practice of the Summoning and Binding of Demons

                       Ateghu, Dedicant of the Void


        As most learned are aware, void magic, unlike no other, commands
and draws its power from the sentient denizens of that plane. While the
individual scholar can accomplish impressive feats through the use of
channeling negative energy, the most potent of invocations require that
the scholar of void be capable of summoning and binding demons to his
will. 
        This fact, more than no other, has lead to the unfortunate bias the
practice of void magic has experienced in the past. Skilled practitioners
will realize that just because on has traffic with the denizens of the lower
regions does not imply that one necessarily will become their unwitting
pawn. Of course, this risk, along with the risk of death at the hands of
that which we summon is a real one, and it is the purpose of this work
to introduce journeyman in our craft into the safe and efficacious methods
of controlling such entities. 

        Before the formal training begins, let me give a Warning:
Demons, like all the denizens of the planes of Order, are creatures bound
by Laws. Our control of them is a direct reflection of our capability to
understand and implement our understanding, however imperfect,
of these Laws. Departing from the way of careful, disciplined studies
into the realm of chaotic, random experimentations is to be avoided
at all costs, for in that path lies the way to our own undoing.
~
E
chapter2~
The first requirement of any demonic conjuration is of primary
importance. The scholar must first determine the diabolical sign which
holds dominance over the demon that is to be summoned. 

        It is one of the great mysteries of our craft why certain demons
are attracted to, and inevitably, bound by, particular symbols. Certainly,
the symbols which bind a particular demon have some connection to both
the origins and the mystical allegiance of the demon. For instance, it will
often happen that a denizen of the demon city of Logor will be drawn by
sigils and runes native to that place. 

        The theory of this author is that the Symbols are abstract
representations of the true forms and names of demonic life and locales.
The principle of sympathy applies to these forms, and thusly, demonic
life is drawn to and contained by the symbols.

        Unfortunately, the ability to inscribe such symbols is not
a matter of simply memorizing the right angles, distances, curvatures,
and so forth. The scholar must be first find the \#prime form\# of the symbol,
and then through study and experience burn the memory of it into the very
fabric of its being. The \#prime form\# of a symbol is not simply a particular
instance -- rather, they are typically the result of unique mystical contact
between our world and the void. For instance, the death of a powerful
demon, or the completion of a truly terrible curse, might leave behind
such a symbol as a residue. That such pure, or prime forms must be
seen and experienced before the void scholar can faithfully replicate them
is only more evidence that they exist on a more abstract plane of
existence.
~
E
chapter3~
Once the scholar has decided on the symbol he is to use, he then
decides on what material with which to inscribe it. The choice of material
tends toward alchemical in flavor, though typically our knowledge of the
proper ones is jealously guarded, being won through dark divination,
long study with infernal sages, or at last resort apprentices used in
carefully controlled experiments.

        Typical fluids or crushed powders, the materials also vary in
rarity and availability. Common materials, such as charcoal, silver
dust, or the simple powdered bone are often sold in guilds, schools,
or apothecaries. Rarer ingredients, such as the blood of celestial beings
or the ground bones of the undead may be much harder to come by.

        It is this very rarity that make scholars loathe to trivially conjure
demons to do their bidding. In times of crisis, lacking the proper supplies
can be painful, if not lethal, to the caster. This rarity also makes masters
of our craft ill-disposed to reveal ingredients which they might consider
valuable.
~
E
chapter4~
Once a symbol has been inscribed in a particular material, the scholar
must then prepare the magical invocation which will call forth the demon.
In general, there are three tiers of demonic invocation, each more potent,
lengthy, and exhausting than the last.

        It should be clear that the more powerful the ritual, so is the more
potent the demon, but what is less obvious is that the same symbol, and the
same ritual can often be used with different rituals to produce differing
demons.

        Most importantly, though, is the knowledge that not every
combination of ritual, symbol, and ingredient will result in a viable
conjured being. Indeed, moreover, these \#dissonant\# combinations,
as they are known, tend to have dire effects on the caster. Sometimes,
exotic will be summoned which will turn on the caster [as the pattern
does not truly control them, being at odds with the laws of demonology].
Other casters have been known to simply vanish after such castings,
or leave behind a dessicated corpse, and so forth.
~
E
chapter5~
When faced with a demon which is the result of a successful
conjuration, there then arises the matter of the Price. For reasons
which elude scholars, this price must be paid in order to bind the
demon to the scholars will. Failure to do so generally results
in unfortunate consequences. 

        The obvious question which arises, of course, is why such
obviously powerful beings would allow themselves to be bound by
we pitiful mortals. In part, we know that the symbols represent
a barrier, or even a trap to demonkind. Still, what compels the demon
to keep once the agreement has been reached?

        It is my belief that while we do have spells which control the
demon, in truth they are not powerful enough to compel their will. Rather,
they are like the token chains that bind a powerful animal. Long ago,
the chains truly bound the creature, but even though they are now more
powerful, they are still restrained by the memory of the chain. Of course,
I do not think this is literally the truth in the case of demonkind. Instead,
I conjecture that either the gods, the ancient alatharya, or some other
powerful entities, took advantage of the inherent rules of the void
to set in place a system of bargains, contracts, and prices that governed
the passage of demons to our world. Those bindings are still in place,
and we tap into them through the use of our elemental magic.
~
E
chapter6~
This brings us to the final section, which concerns the control
of demons once they have been summoned and their price has been
paid. There are really two categories of demons -- those that perform
specific services, and then return to the void, and those that stay at the
scholars side, performing in response to his direct commands.

        Of the ones who remain at the side of the scholar, great care
must be taken. They are bound for various periods of time, which is
determined by the relative power of the demon. At the end of this
period, the scholar must infuse the demons binding with more
magical energy, in order to renew his control for an additional
time interval.

        Sadly, each subsequent infusing of energy into the bond
must be greater than the last. Eventually, the scholar will be unable
to pay the cost in magic to renew the bond, it will break, and there
will be dire results. Fortunately, just as there are summoning spells,
magical research has resulted in an equal and opposite spell to
banish demons back to whence they came. Be warned: Not all
demons are eager to return!
~
E
chapter7~
Demonkind are a fascinating and diverse lot. Some will
fight for the caster, willingly rending flesh and snapping bone
with great enthusiasm. Others, used to service to greater demon
sultans, will act as bodyguard, substituting chitin and blasphemous
growth for soft flesh. And there are a multitude of others -- 
succubi, blobs of alien tissue, spined horrors not the least of them.

        Tread cautiously. Memorize the combination of symbol,
material, spell, and price, so that demons will serve you, rather than
you them.

Tallest of the seraphim, the statue of Adurranash stands proud.  His
form, clad only in a loincloth, is powerfully muscled and marked with the
scars of countless victories, detailed in golden paint.  He is depicted
clasping a standard of fire and ch\@lonin in his might grasp, his head tilted
back in a battlecry.  

A golden plaque at the base of the statue reads, \#He who would accept the

The eyes of the statue of In\@vesi have something in common with those of
a predatory bird, fixed as they are with tremendous intensity on some
faraway point.  A massive quiver of platinum-fletched arrows has been carved
in granite on his back, while in his right hand he carries a longbow larger
than a human.  His left hand is occupied with a scroll, on which are drawn
battle formations.  

A silver plaque at the base of the statue reads, \#He who would seek the

Silvery hair has been carved atop her head, and her soft features find their
purest expression in the white gleam of her eyes.  In her hand is an
elegantly-simple chalice of beaten gold, partly filled with clear water.

Though depicted here only in statue form, the gaze of the seraph-avenger
Pharul is a hard one to meet, somehow capturing the piercing intensity of
the true archangel himself.  The statue leans forward in eager pursuit, its
jaw set in a knife-edge line of resolve.  Vast wings spread behind him,
carved in the very moment of unfurling.  A scroll has been laid out at his
feet, filled almost to completion with the names of the heavenly host.  

A marble plaque at the base of the statue reads, \#He who would carry out the

Ecclesiarch in a gesture of sororal protection, while the other holds a
rune-etched curving blade at the ready.  A simple shield of rounded bronze
rests against her left leg.  

At the base of the statue an obsidian plaque reads, \#She who would take the

The mysteries of the Fanged Codpiece of Sorrows are many.  Where do the

groove, once worn?  The answers to these questions are lost in time.  But it
has been said, by someone whose name was lost in time, that the Fanged
Codpiece of Sorrows is one of the greatest rewards a True Hero may receive. 
And only a True Hero with bold fashion sense, confident in his or her... 
masculinity...  can do this great piece of equipment justice.

crown heroday award woven fowl tongues tongue legendary~
the Crown of Woven Fowl Tongues~
A legendary crown of woven fowl tongues sits here. Gloriously.~
The Crown of Woven Fowl Tongues was created in the age of Myth, when
Titans walked the lands, great creatures from distant planes strove against
demigods, and birds were the size of bjorcha and had really, really long
tongues.  Long enough to weave together, which was what one strange demigod,
one of the Shias Lords named Ertimas, did one afternoon when he was rather
bored.  Seeing his odd new fashion accessory, other Shias Lords attempted to
replicate this feat, but none had the sheer fashion sense to pull it off. 
So this is one of a kind, and thereby prized by--and a prize for--True
Heroes.

Carved from pure grey marble and marked with mystical runes, this vault
is an enormous room, easily large enough to hold a stone giant, or even a
dragon.  Supported by enormous tons of stone, the Vault appears designed to
survive a very large amount of punishment.  The once-pristine marble is
scorched a pure ash-black, coated with a thick layer of grimy cinders. 
Long, rent cracks in the stone issue wisps of smoke from time to time, and
each rune glows with renewed spiritlight.  The floor is oddly smooth and
unhurt, the glassy surface now polished to a mirror finish.  To the north, 
a charred archway leads out onto the open, ruined dome.

A Smoky Room~
The exact proportions and composition of this room are hazy and
indistinct; there is a dreamlike quality to your surroundings.  Through a
roiling shimmer of heat you get the general impression of dark walls and a
dark floor, but little more.  Stark and clear, though, is the gate in the
south wall: an asymmetrical arch of cracked, fused obsidian leans to one
side.  A small plaque has been chiseled out of the glassine stone.  No other
features or exits are apparent.

plaque~
I come before the Dragon\@s Feast.
I keep at bay both dark and beast.

I may be born when others die,
My tears do glow and sting and fly.

I speak of honored deeds and glories,
Those around me know the stories.

Some send me rafted on the waves,
Some raise me up on wooden staves.

A gold vermilion is my hue,
Then grey and white, if I serve true.

You are floating, weightless, in a pale silver clearing.  Beads of light

A huge fountain of magic erupts with a constant outpouring of force and

elegant pathway of pale slate leads off to the east and west, winding
through a lush carpet of green grass.

prickly rosebushes, the aroma of their pure white blossom mingling with that
of the roses.

lingers for a time after a rain.

Wind billows furiously around you, randomly shifting direction from

Deep Within the Earth~
This spherical chamber is filled with a palpable energy.  On every side
of you are glimmering shafts of crystal much like the inside of a geode, but
the walls seem to flex and stretch causing the formations to slowly
undulate.  The myriad of colors displayed is evidence of the minerals these
structures were formed from; most plentiful are the shafts of emerald,
diamond, and bloodstone which make up the majority of the crystals.  A faint
yet noticeable current of air flows through the chamber and creates a soft
whooshing noise as it passes between the crystals and is reminiscent of
slow, heavy breathing.

Look at which type of crystal: Diamond, Emerald, or Bloodstone?
~
E
bloodstone bloodstones~
Smooth shafts of pearlescent green are spotted with red ferrous
starbursts which give this mineral its name.  The bloodstone crystals are
noticeably thinner than most of the other formations, and move in patterns
uniquely from those surrounding them, almost as if they had their own
personalities.  Their opaque coloration does not allow light to be
refracted, but their stunning appearance is more than appealing just the
same.  As they extend towards you, it almost seems like they want you to
grasp them.  
~
E
emerald emeralds~
Dark emerald crystals are easily the largest of the formations in this
chamber, as they seem to have grown in clusters which dominate entire
sections of the walls.  The deep green hue is entrancing as you gaze into
the depths of their partially translucent structures.  Faint shimmers of
light accentuate the natural sheen of these beautiful gems.  As they extend
towards you, it almost seems like they want you to grasp them.  
~
E
diamond diamonds~
The diamond crystals are arguably the most stunning feature of this
chamber.  The refracted light from some unseen source creates innumerable
tiny stars which glitter across the walls.  Each shaft seems to extend and
retract with individual intent, as if each is taking turns sipping the
energy from the room.  As they extend towards you, it almost seems like they
want you to grasp them.

Carved from light-yellow stones, this caved-in room is the foyer to the
Tower of Aramril, former home of the Champions of the Light.  Rubble and
debris nearly choke the narrow passage remaining through the large chunks of
stone and bent iron portcullis.  A few tattered scraps of once-colorful wall
hangings are seen admist the wreckage, their fragmented scenes showing
moments from brighter days in the history of the Champions.  The courtyard
of the tower opens to the north.  Bloodstains and powdery dustmarks smear
the walls, and a charred stink hangs in the heavy air.

through the cracks and holes in the tower structure above.  A fountain,
partially hidden by fallen stone blocks and still showing black scorch marks
from the shuddeni attack, lies empty in the center of the courtyard.  A
skull has been smashed against the northeastern wall, dried gore spattered
outwards from the point of impact and fragments of bone lying in a pile on the
floor beneath.  Musty air smells of smoke and blood, the atmosphere tense
and uneasy.

A Skeletal Sandstone Stairwell~
A chipped stone stairwell zigzags its way up the side of the north wall,
half of the stairs caved in.  Huge gaps and rents look out over the north
forest and the Vale of Aramril.  Considering the massive damage to the
structure, it is wholly remarkable that the stairwell still stands.  A
narrow gap in the rubble still allows a flexible person to move south.  The
debris-clogged stairs continue up and down.

A Ruined Intersection~
The walls here are barely standing, the stone sagging and masonry
cracked.  Large chunks of the ceiling have collapsed, and the floor is
covered with an uncertain coating of rubble and debris.  The air stinks of
ash.

A Defiled Chapel~
The barrel-vaulted roof of this chapel is charred and ash-smeared, the
walls smashed and cracked.  Blood is everywhere, strange designs and odd
runes marked out in the gore.  The pews are smashed to kindling, and the
altar has been knocked over on its side.

A Skeletal Sandstone Stairwell~
A chipped stone stairwell zigzags its way up the side of the north wall,
half of the stairs caved in.  Huge gaps and rents look out onto a solid,
roiling wall of dense smog.  The curved barrier of oily smoke clings
malevolently to the stone, wrapping the Tower in a dark envelope. 
Considering the massive damage to the structure, it is wholly remarkable
that the stairwell still stands.  A blackened arch allows egress to the
south, and the stairs descend into darkness at your feet.

A Cracked, Open Dome~
You stand on an empty floor beneath a blasted, ruined dome.  The scale of
the dome is quite impressive, or was; now the curvature of the molded stone
is for the most part completely destroyed.  Pieces of rock lie smashed to
bits on the floor, the barest fragments of ornate bas-reliefs still evident
upon them.  Chips of rubble crunch and shift underfoot.  A small metal stair
which once spiralled to the top of the Dome lies twisted and blackened, bent
out of shape and pushed almost completely over.  An enormous arch leads
south, and two smaller arches lead north and east.  The dome is, for the
most part, open to the sky, a dark, sulphuric smog obscuring any light which
might filter in.

The Desecrated Vault of the Champions~
Carved from pure grey marble and marked with
mystical runes, this vault is an enormous room, easily large enough to hold
a stone giant, or even a dragon.  Supported by enormous tons of stone, the
Vault appears designed to survive a very large amount of punishment.  The
once-pristine marble is scorched a pure ash-black, coated with a thick layer
of grimy cinders, and broad cracks lace the walls and ceiling.  An enormous
pentacle, bloodstained and spattered with gore, has been carved deeply into
the hard floor.  Runes all around the room lie dead and dark, foul symbols
and counter-runes obscuring each one.  To the north, a charred archway leads
out onto the open, ruined dome.

portal~
Thin beams of light stream through the shutters of the windows looking
out towards each of the four compass points.  The crude shutters do not
completely block the view however and to the north you can see the vast
realm of Avendar spread out like a beautiful carpet, from the green forests
of Nendor to the distant blue sparkle of the Uthlin Ocean.  West the shimmer
of a bridge of mist catches your eye, and east lies a view of the opposite
tower, glowing in the sunlight.  The shuddeni can overlook the cloudy
expanse to the south for signs of invaders.  The surface of the large desk
in the room is completely covered with battle plans and supply orders from
the front.  The furnishings of this room are imported from the undercities
of the Shuddeni, both plush and extravagant to serve the war-leaders of the
Scourge.  A twisting staircase leads back into the palace.

A Makeshift Prison~
The yellow sandstone walls of this room are scorched and charred, as if
by a great fire.  The floor has been swept clean of the ashes, however, and
several manacles have been secured with metal bolts driven deep into the
rock.  A multifaceted crystal glows with dull red light, illuminating the
room.  A large iron-banded safe sits in one corner.  To the west, a
doorless arch opens out onto a ruined, blasted dome.

multifaceted crystal~
This crystal has been carved into a multifaceted pear shape, seeming like
a blood-red fruit.  Pendulous and almost ripe-seeming, it illuminates the
room in a garish crimson light.

E
portal~
A large chamber spreads before you.  Braziers have been lit in different
parts of the chamber, and dark smoke roils forth, filling the air with ashes
and stinging your eyes.  Stone pillars rise in the middle of the room,
carved with dark runes and horrific images.  Four passages spread from the
corners of this chamber, leading to the altars that pay tribute to the
principles the shuddeni worship.
  
[Exits: north east south west]
(Invis) (Translucent) The high priest of Yithoul stands directing the work of his underlings.
