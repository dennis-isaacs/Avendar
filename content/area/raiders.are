gambler shuddeni obese hideously raidergambler~
a hideously obese shuddeni~
A hideously obese shuddeni sits here by the bonfire, rolling a pair of dice.
~
Garbed in little more than breeches and a breezy tunic, this shuddeni\@s
horrendous paunch is plainly visible.  The wrinkled flabs of gray skin droop
over the edge of his overly-tight belt, protected only by the filmy gauze of
his tunic.  His legs, in comparison, seem little more than twigs, barely
able to support his amorphous bulk.  His eyeless gaze seems perpetually
focused upon the pair of dice within his hands.

A slender aelin girl sits at the edge of the pool.
~
Your gaze rests upon a slender aelin girl, garbed in a low cut blouse of
silky material.  Her fair wings, though somewhat disheveled in appearance,
give her a modestly angelic appearance.  Her pale white skin glistens
beneath droplets of shimmering water.  Slowly, she turns her lucid green
eyes towards you, silently beckoning for your attention.

A hooded sentry stands watch over the northern pass.

Clad in dark, camouflage hues, this rugged bandit stands guard over the
northern pass.  Thickly built and steely eyed, the sentry attends to his
task with the grim determination that none shall pass by uninvited.  A dark
veil covers most of his face, leaving nothing more than his eyeline visible.

Dhalija aelin~
Dhalija~
Dhalija, the Wing of Twilight, is here guarding the Vault vigilantly.
~
A dark Aelin flies lazily here at the edge of the torchlight.  She
protects the Raider\@s vault vigilantly, because she is paid quite well to do
the job and takes much pride in her work.  Her distaste for those things
good has led her to this point in her life and would not turn back for
anything to the way of the Light.

Shughoth~
Shughoth, the Flame of Twilight, is here guarding the Vault with his magic.
~
A dark-gray colored Shuddeni is here, seemingly paying no heed to his
surroundings while twiddling a tiny flame across his fingertips.  To think
that he is unaware of his environment is foolish.  He is paid along with the
other three guardians a handsome salary to guard the Raider\@s vault, and he
does so to the best of his ability for he likes nothing better than to
destroy.

A huge Alatharyan stands here with his hands on his hips.  He looks like

he is paid to guard.

the forward scout~
A grizzled scout, clad in dark camouflage, keeps watch over the crevice to the north.
~
The surrounding light glints poisonously off of the scout\@s beady,
obsequious little eyes.  Paired with a sharp, hook-like nose, the forward
scout\@s stubbly, dirt-encrusted face exudes an almost rodent-like quality. 
His body, small and compact, is drawn taut as a bowstring.  As he maintains
his unflinching watch upon the northern crevice, the forward scout remains
almost completely motionless.

scout wandering raiderthief~
a wandering scout~
A wandering scout traverses the canyon, keeping a wary eye out for enemies.
~
A figure, swathed in garments of coarse, dirt-encrusted linen, traverses
the canyon grounds.  A dusty scabbard, bearing a curved blade of sizable
proportion, is slung haphazardly about his lean waist.  A rumpled cap of
wound cloth hangs loosely about his head, shading his pock-marked face.  His
sharp eyes keep watch over the canyon, ever alert for the presence of
intruders.

the srryn shaman~
An aging srryn, dressed in the garb of a shaman, is here, preparing poultices.
~
A squat looking srryn, covered in the tattered remains of a once
fine-looking cloak, squats upon the earthen floor.  A multititude of
necklaces dangle from around his neck, some imbued with shamanistic
symbolism, some with little more than bright colors.  A pair of livid scars,
apparently self-inflicted, form a cross, centered upon the milky center of
his right eye.  Paid in advance by the Raider House, he stands ready to bind
the wounds of any Raider in need.

malenrion ethron wizened bent mob_12114~
Malenrion~
A wizened, bent ethron, Malenrion keeps a sharp watch here.
~
Malenrion Filarwen sits here in well-earned repose, a slight paunch
accentuated by his bent, aged shoulders, now slumped into a hunch from his
advanced years.  Pale green skin is cobwebbed with a fine network of lines,
and wisps of pale hair seem ghostly and insubstantial.  His eyes, however,
remain bright and sharp, their dark irises alert and perceptive.  

The ethron formerly held the position of Highlord for many decades, serving
with wile and tact over several generations of active Raiders.  His
political machinations and interpersonal maneuverings, both with mortal and
demon, served the interests of the Canyon and himself admirably for some
time.  Known and feared in his time as a dedicant of the greed-avatar
Khamurn, he still bears the sigil with an almost subdued pride.  

At the moment of his death, Khamurn visited him for a final time, offering
him immortality; for a price, as always.  What the price or barter between
the two was is not known, though widely rumored.  In the end, Malenrion
returned to the Canyon under the terms of a demonic pact, content to
continue handling and amassing wealth as chief merchant among the
Raiderkind.

A mass of scarred muscle stands before you, stripped to the waist. 
Brandishing a heavily weighted iron net in one hand, and a leather bullwhip
in the other, the alatharyan trainer stands stolidly in the center of his

grizzled face an inveterate toughness.

Oily black hair is cropped closely about this rogue\@s hard, angular face.
A thick tangle of unshorn stubble envelops most of his dark, weathered skin,
extending from his high cheekbones down to the bottom of his protruding jaw.
His eyes are a murky grey, and seem quick and perceptive, set beneath a
thick brow.  His nose is slightly too large, its hooked shape dominating the
rest of his face.  A man of considerable height, standing nearly six and a
half feet tall, he bears himself with the casual slouch of a man evading
notice.

a heavy square gold signet ring~
A thick, heavy ring of pure gold lies here, a setting sun laid out as a signet.~
This is the ring of the first Raider Lord, Aralor.  After systematically
eliminating the other contenders for his position amongst the original
Circle of Twelve, Aralor stood as the undisputed leader of the Canyon. 
Anticipating the onset of old age, Aralor knew that he could remain the
leader of the Canyon for as long as he could fend off the rising tide of
challengers.  

Unwilling to relinquish his hold on power, Aralor appealed to the dark gods
that had empowered the Raiders.  His prayers and sacrifices were soon
answered.  Not only was he granted the immortality he sought, but he was
further gifted with strength beyond that of mortal men, and a supernatural
relation with the shadows of the world.  Aralor rejoiced and marvelled at
his new powerse, believing that they ensured that he would never fade from
the face of Avendar.  

But power comes with a price.  For in attaining his powers, Aralor had
unwittingly ascended to the status of a demigod, and was now bound by the
divine law that binds all immortals.  No longer could he freely inflict
himself upon the world like a cancerous plague.  Instead, the sole object of
his desires now lay behind an invisible shield whose laws and workings lay
beyond his grasp.

This statue, made from lustreless black marble, is roughly four and a
half feet in height.  It depicts a startlingly realistic humanoid of
indisctint heritage, portrayed in a half-crouch.  An exquisite expression of
pain mars the figure\@s features, eyes screwed up in agony and mouth twisted
in an obscene grimace.  

From the figure\@s hunched back three claws are sculpted in the act of
pushing their ways through the flesh and bone.  Curved and wickedly tipped,
they seem to possess some pent-up energy of their own, even though the
statue is cold and absolutely motionless.  

A definite sense of menace surrounds the statue, a nameless malice akin to a
caged, angry beast.

frame, slightly muscled with tightly drawn skin, is sharply defined.
Muscles are evident beneath her skin, and bones are sharply pronounced.
Slender forearms end in small, clawed hands.  Her four fingers on each hand
sports a sharp claw.  A pair of wings erupt from between her shoulder
blades, stretching out to either side.  Held straight, they reach close to
six feet in width, supporting her small, four foot frame.  Her face, tight
with defined features, is sharply angled.  From her ears, which are sharply
pointed, to her nose, which is small and sharply accented.  Pronounced
cheekbones frame her eyes, which are two small, black orbs.  Her bald head

A young ch\@taren woman, beautiful golden skin faintly translucent, stands

elegance of her race.  Simple, yet well-tailored and well-fitting clothing
graces her figure, flowing along the serpentine curves of her body.  Two
pauldrons of pure white leather sit on each shoulder, one emblazoned with a
small pegasus of silver, the other with small sapphires in the pattern of a
spear.  Not entirely stable, her form shimmers and wavers occasionally.  Her
movements, fluid and almost cat-like in their coordination and precision, are
somehow as indescribably alien as her otherworldly beauty.

A tall female caladaran stands before you, her grey hair pulled back
neatly into a ponytail at the back of her neck.  The ponytail has been
secured by a small stone, and the crown of her head is encircled with a ring
of thin stone.  Her skin is rough and barklike like that of most caladarans,
yet her face has a softer texture, appearing more like a dark-skinned human.
A few signs of aging can be seen about her eyes, though she bears the marks
with an air of elegance.  Her hands are tipped with long, slender fingers,
and are attached at the end of spindly, thin arms.  Her dark brown eyes look
as young as anyone\@s and reflect the light of the locale, glinting with a
hint of inner knowing.

escape through the dense blackness.  Her facial features are complimented
with her bright blue eyes and small child-like nose.  Her pale skin has only
the slightest golden hew to it showing little time spent in the sun. 
Draping her body is a long dark gray robe that allows only her wings to be
revealed.  Nearly half the size of her small frame a pair of feathered white
and black speckled wings hold her aloft.

Slim dainty wings match the color of her hair and bear a slight sheen.  Her
frame is lithe, sleek and willowy her stature average height.  Her skin,
smooth alabaster, is unmarred though bears an array of streaks and smudges
wherever there is a lack of clothing or armour.  A thin band of onyx
encircles her right bicep.

>data_prog humanfemale~
Before you stands a older slender human female.  Upon setting your gaze
upon her you notice her long jet black hair with streaks of gray.  Yet there
is a gray spot in particular above her right eye.  Her face is in the
perfect shape of a oval.  Her eyes clear as water, with a tint of green
circling in the depth of them.  The wrinkles in the corners of her eyes
betray her true age.  Her nose is petite and curves upward towards the tip. 
She has small pink lips that is always curved upwards in a smile.  Her hands
are small and thin like the rest of her body.  Her skin is softly tanned and
radiates a glow of confidence about herself.

>data_prog srrynmale2~
His muscles bulging and rippling, this medium-sized srryn moves about
with a mixture of stealth and presence.  His darkened body is anything but
pretty.  Many of his once shiny black scales have long since cracked and
dulled under a multitude of punishing blows.  Disregarding the obviously
trained warrior\@s nature of his stance and movements, you detect an almost
scholarly intelligence present behind his opaque, red eyes.  His pronounced
claws have been sharpened to razors, and carved into each of them is a
small, amazingly-detailed picture of a haunting, eyeless mask enveloped in
darkness.  
~
>data_prog srrynmale~
Before you looms a massive beast, both towering in height and bulky with
giant strength.  Ferocity covers his features, darkening his face.  His eyes
are a deep crimson and almost seem alive with fire.  Within his mouth are
great fangs, and his long, forked tongue darts out from behind them.  Flared
nostrils add to his unfriendly appearance, as he seems domineering and
arrogant.  His arms are long and packed with muscle.  Sharp claws mark the
end of each, deadly weapons themselves along with the one he carries.  His
long legs are just as large, capable of both quick and powerful movements. 
Covering his entire body are thick red scales, as dark as his eyes.  
~
>data_prog kankmale~
Standing nearly six and a half feet in height is a kankoran.  From his
neatly groomed short fur, it is plain to see he is heavily muscled.  His fur
is a rich golden reddish color, with a small patch of silver fur near the
middle of his back.  There are a few smaller patches of white fur around his
hands and feet, and a small patch of white fur under his left eye.  His eyes
are a piercing black, devoid of life, his face emotionless.  He is clothed
in dark leather, with a light cape of black linen tied around his neck, and
two scabbards about his waist.  
~
>data_prog ethronmale~
A tall ethron, his dark hair cut short and untended, glances about
warily.  Worn armor covers his body, the ethron caring not for matching what
he wears.  His hands hold a huge staff, battered and dented from years of
battle and defense, thrown carelessly from one hand to another.  Strapped on
his back is a huge knapsack, stitches and patches covering most of the
leather that was.  On his arms, black bracers pulsate in tune to his
movement, a soft laughter emitting from the darkness of which they were
crafted.  His eyes gleam a pale and faded blue, age now beginning to rest
upon them.  His mouth and chin are covered by a blackened cloth, burns
slightly in view around the edges.  
~
>data_prog chtarenmale~
A slender, golden-skinned man is here, his body vaguely translucent. 
Sparkling silver hair is pulled back from his face in a tight ponytail, the
color matching that of his gleaming eyes.  The features of his face are soft
and unthreatening, a smile often gracing his lips.  Not particularly
muscular, this ch\@taren carries himself with an odd air of implacable
strength.  
~
>data_prog caladmale~
A tall creature is here, it appears to be a little more than 6 feet tall.
His hair is long and have been plaited, almost like the branches on a willow
tree.  His arms and legs are long and thin, yet they appear strong and
nimble.  His body, like his legs and arms, is thin and it is a bit short
when compared to his long limbs.  Lightless eyes, as black as coal, stare
out blankly from his wooden face.  
~
>data_prog shuddenimale2~
A gaunt shuddeni, his skin stretching over bones and tendons, watches you
quietly.  Veins can be seen under the surface of his pallid, ashen grey
skin, slowly pulsing and pumping blood through his small frame.  His small
head is balanced upon a slim neck, hairless and smooth.  A crooked nose
looks as though it was once broken, and his thin lips are cracked and
peeling.  A smooth, empty space is all that can be seen above his nose, his
face devoid of eyes.  Thin, bony fingers extend from his small hands, wrists
extending out of the sleeves of a stone grey cape, covering most of his body
and armors.  
~
>data_prog shuddenimale~
Before you stands an abnormally tall shuddeni, dressed in elegantly kept
black silks.  He bears himself with the calm assurance of one inshakably
confident of his own ability.  Broad about the shoulders, his chest narrows
down towards a trim waist line.  A richly embroidered cloak is draped
loosely about his body, held together by an onyx medallion.  By his side
hangs a lacquered black scabbard, thin and curving in shape.  Lithe and
graceful in his movements, there is a distinctly serpentine quality about
his mien.  
~
>data_prog nefmalesch~
Nemosr appears small in stature, even for a nefortu.  His v-shaped face
is dominated by bulbous green eyes and wide, pointed ears that intrude
slightly into the form of his head.  A pair of deep-brown wings, size to
match his frame, extend from his shoulders and end in tiny bony points.  His
movements are graceless at best, often taking on a bouncing effect as he
propels himself along, half jumping, half flapping his wings.  Dressed not
so much in bulky armor than in miscellaneous fineries, he appears to prefer
shiny and valuable-looking wares over ones which might provide his person
heavy defense or magical enhancement.  A certain darkness looms over him, as
if the external light sources in the area around him wane in his presence.  
~
>data_prog nefmale~
A figure of looming darkness glides along before you.  Clad in the
bleakest of dark black robes, a symbol of a crescent moon has been sewn onto
the front.  The nefortu wears no ornate jewelery of the such, but rather
presents a noble look with the calm air about him.  His eyes seem ever clear
with a hint of caution within them.  His skin glows a pale white has light
shines off its reflective black surface.  A pair of leathery wings arch
outwards from his back to meet in the end with their tips barely crossing. 
He glides along the ground with a commanding presence of magic and strength.
~
>data_prog alathmale~
Here you see a looming shape, whose massive stature blocks out the sky. 
Muscles like boulders tumble down his arms and chest.  His legs are like oak
trees, planted firm, unmovable.  His movements displace the very air, and
the ground thuds at the impact of his comings and goings.  Above his brow,
linked beads black and brown hang, creating a sheet covering his eyes,
though he moves as if he sees without hinder.  Below his chisled nose, his
mouth is grimly set.  
~
>data_prog aelinmalesch~
Standing in your field of vision is a rather tall aelin man.  His hair,
unlike most aelin is dark.  This fellow\@s is black, matching the robing
which covers the entirety of his body.  The rest of his head is nothing
short of beautiful.  You would almost say that it was feminine, in its
grace.  Almost.  The body itself is of average build.  His arms aren\@t
overly large, fitting with his body rather well.  His hands, however, have
the look of one who uses them in various enchantments.  Obviously, this
fellow is a scholar.  His robing stands open, showing what armor he wears. 
It has slots cut into the back of it, allowing his spotless white wings to
protrude.  
~
>data_prog aelinmale~
A regal looking aelin man hovers before you, his wings fluttering
silently.  Noble heritage is evident in his general countenance, resulting
in a finely boned, fair skinned specimin.  His wings hold him slightly aloft
the ground, beating behind his narrow shoulders.  Lacking defined muscles,
his limbs appear weak upon first glance.  His fair, alabaster skin is drawn
smoothly over his short frame.  Free of blemishes or scars, his skin seems
almost surreal.  A sharp, finely boned face draws your gaze almost
instinctively, with eyes of slate grey looking out from under thin eyebrows
and a shock of fire red hair.  
~
>data_prog humanmale2~
Oily black hair is cropped closely about this rogue\@s hard, angular face.
A thick tangle of unshorn stubble envelops most of his dark, weathered skin,
extending from his high cheekbones down to the bottom of his protruding jaw.
His eyes are a murky grey, and seem quick and perceptive, set beneath a
thick brow.  His nose is slightly too large, its hooked shape dominating the
rest of his face.  A man of considerable height, standing nearly six and a
half feet tall, he bears himself with the casual slouch of a man evading
notice.  
~
>data_prog humanmale~
A swarthy man stands here.  His sleek build suits his medium frame well. 
Glossy black hair has been cut short, and kept neat and clean.  Lightless
eyes, black as coal, gaze ferociously at his surroundings.  Cleanly shaved
and free from imperfection, his masterful face is turned into a sinister
picture by the compassionless smile set in stone.  Dressed in snug black
leather, he stands imperiously.  His movements are slow and deliberate.  The
calmness with which he carries himself seems like it might wane at any
minute.

A shuddeni of magnificent stature stands before you, swathed in flowing

twisting about his figure like a nest of vipers.  At either end of his waist
can be found one of a matching pair of glistening blades.  

Almost as tall in height as an alatharyan warrior, the figure before you is
powerfully built.  The muscles in his cheeks seem clearly drawn out beneath
the surface of his pale, grey skin.  The smooth, tightly drawn flesh is
stretched over a thick, over-arching brow and sunken eyesockets, leaving a

Beyond the Crevice~
After the initial point of narrowness, the crevice cuts a sharp zig-zag
through the cliff face, finally opening up into a widening, rough-hewn
archway, overhung with lush vines, ferns and creepers.  The ground is
densely covered by a blanket of closely planted ferns and bushes.  Rays of
crepuscular light from the south fall upon a handful of leafy, exotic trees,
tall enough to barely scrape against the rising ceiling.  A faintly beaten
footpath can be seen, winding its way to the southwest.  Farther to the
south, a steep precipice overlooks a darkly verdant canyon, hemmed in by
craggy walls to the east and west.

A Small Recess in the Canyon Wall~
You stand within a small recess in the canyon wall.  It looks to be some
sort of guard post, where anyone standing here has a great view of the path
leading down from the heights which hang over the canyon.  The alcove is
definitely hand-made and not natural, chisel marks can be seen driven into
the rock at all different kinds of angles.  The canyon floor lies to the
east.

Beside the High Chair~
You stand in a recessed section of the tent, extended towards the east. 
A jewelled censer dangles from the ceiling, slowly releasing billows of dark
purple smoke.  Brightly colored cushions line the ground, covering the floor
in a rainbow of silken tassels.  A large mahogany coffer rests in the
northeastern corner, its golden bindings covered in ornate archaic script. 
On top of the glistening chest, a bundle of rolled incense rests atop a pad
of scented cloth.  From the northern end, the rushing waters of the Dantaron
river can be heard cresting against the banks.  The tent flaps are closed
off in all directions, save back westward.

Abrupt End of the Footpath~
Rough, naturally hewn walls of rock and dirt rise up on either side,
hemming in the north and the west ends.  Up above, a row of large boulders
rest precariously at the tip of the western ledge.  The ground is densely
covered by a blanket of closely planted ferns and bushes.  Broad rays of
light cut through the open patches of a leafy canopy, which scrapes against
the rocky beams that arch overhead.  The footpath winds its way from the
east, ending abruptly at a sharp precipice to the south, at the bottom of
which, a rushing inlet feeding into the Dantaron can be seen.  A wooden
suspension bridge, tied down by four wooden pegs on this side, sways with
the breeze over the precipice.  Several vines can also be seen hanging from
rocky arches crossing over the chasm.

A Suspension Bridge~
Rays of light cut through the gaps between rocky archways up above and
the myriad of vines hanging from them, their harsh glare landing upon the
ever swaying body of the suspension bridge.  The base of the bridge is made
up rows of long wooden planks, unevenly slapped together, and suspended upon
a lightly woven frame of rope.  Roughly wide enough for two full-sized men
to cross side by side, the hastily slapped together bridge nevertheless
looks far from stable, and liable to break apart at any moment.  The
frazzled hemp hand-rails do little to help the illusion of the bridge\@s
stability.  A constant roar echoes from far below, coming from a rushing
stream flowing to the east, feeding into the fens and the Dantaron.

An Outcropping Above the Canyon~
You stand atop a large rock outcropping that looms over a secluded
canyon.  Large, verdant cliffs hem the canyon in on all sides, protecting it
from sight.  Down below, the dark outlines of several camouflage tents can
be seen against the lush backdrop of the canyon floor.  To the north, a
wooden suspension bridge hangs over a deep, yawning chasm.  At its bottom,
the gap is filled with a torrent of rushing waters that flow towards the
east, feeding into the fens and the Dantaron.  Several vines can also be
seen hanging from rocky arches crossing over the chasm.  To the south, a

A Winding Path Into the Canyon~
The way down this small, rocky path is mildly treacherous, but easily
traversed by anyone with any semblance of agility.  Smoke and floating
cinders from a large fire below waft listlessly through the air by your face
as you stand on the path.  Sounds of several revelers drinking below and
whispers of carnal delights from the mouths of trollops bounce around the
canyon wildly.  You can continue down the path or head to the overhand above
the canyon.

On the Canyon Floor~
The canyon floor stretches far into the distance, dotted with rows of
hastily erected tents.  Sheer cliff walls, worn away by centuries of
erosion, rise sharply to the east and west.  A lengthy shadow, cast by a
rocky overhang, falls sharply across the canyon floor.  Sparks of flickering
light float down from above, issued from the the bonfire raging to the
south.  A small recess has been carved into the western face of the canyon
wall.  A gravelly path leads to the south and to the east.

Beside the Roaring Bonfire~
The center of the canyon is dominated by a massive bonfire, its flaming
tendrils licking at the sky.  Thick black smoke billows languidly from the
crackling inferno, blanketing the sky with an ashen haze.  Irregularly cut
logs and branches jut out fom the base of the fire.  Chipped mugs, smelling
distinctly of cheap alcohol, are strewn haphazardly about the blackened pit
at the bonfire\@s base.  Racks of roasting meat turn by the edge of the
flames, held aloft by grease coated spits.  A thick wooden keg rests off to
the side of the bonfire, an amber liquid dripping from its faucet.  Two
wooden tents lie next to a path that runs southward towards one large tent.

Inside the Tent~
As you step into this small brown tent, the pungent scent of incense
greets you.  Smoking embers are arranged in a pit in the center of the tent,
obviously the source of the smell.  Arranged around the base of the tent are
an odd assortment of blackened roots and bleached bones, each arranged in a
careful design.  A row of multi-colored jars lines the back end of the tent,
each one filled with an assortment of severed animal appendages and
glistening powders.  The far end of the tent is occupied by the skull of a
gigantic crocodile.  The tent flaps open to the west.

Inside the Large Tent~
Just inside the entrance of the large tent, there are several large
potted palm trees, but they look as untended as the pots outside the
entrance.  The warm air from the fire blows even as far as here, as the
entranceway flaps softly.  You can see the High Chair to the south of here,
on a raised wooden dais.  You can exit the tent to the north.

Path Around the Large Tent~
This small path winds around the side of the large tent, then turns south
towards the back of the canyon.  Several small pebbles and stones are packed
deeply into the ground, giving the path a smooth integrity.  A few stray
pieces of ash from the fire to the northeast, float around your head.  You
can head along the path to the south or east, in front of the large tent.

In Front of the Storage Pit~
The storage pit, used by the Raiders, lies to the south.  Even from here,
the lighted torches at the corners of the pit, shed light upon the area. 
The large tent is to the east, but it is only the side, there are not
entrances in and the material seems to extend deep into the ground.  You can
go south to the storage pit or north around the side of the large tent.

Above the Storage Pit~
This narrow room at the end of the Canyon houses the storage pit of the
Raiders.  Dug down into the crumbly grey stone, the pit is covered with many
heavy boards, lashed and nailed together.  Two large torches burn brightly,
though their placement fills the room with inconstant shadows.  The walls
slant in a westward direction, blocking the view of the sky here.  The
canyon opens up to the north, and a small alcove has been carved into the
wall to the west.

Inside the Storage Pit~
You stand inside the dug-out pit that the Raiders use for stashing their
loot and the fabled stones of power.  The hard-packed ground makes the
sturdy walls of the pit.  It is covered by a set of wooden planks tied
together and thrown across the top of the pit.  You can exit up through the
door cut into the planks.

High Chair of the Raider Lord~
The High Chair is reserved for the Raider Lord, leader of the House.  It
is merely a wooden chair with some gold inlays, but holds more symbolic
meaning than anything.  If any members of the House are found lounging in
it, it will surely mean their deaths by the hands of the leader.  A small
alcove lies to the east or you can head north towards the entranceway.

A Path Behind the Tents~
A thin path branches off from the main avenue of the canyon walk,
circling its way around the mass of tents.  Hemmed in by a sheer cliff wall
to the north and a flapping tent canvas to the south, the actual path is no
more than two spans wide.  Rivulets of water from the Dantaron trickle down
the walls, forming small puddles by the side of the trail.  Winding its way
against the sandstone cliffs, the path continues to the east.

The Training Pen~
The incline to the north suddenly widens into a large earthen pit, ringed
with spiked body-shields.  Roughly ten spans deep, the training pen is a
circular arena, roughly dug from the earth.  A thick layer of dirt covers
the ground, sending up clouds of dust with each step.  High above, rocky
crags jut out from the cliff wall, casting a lengthening shadow across the
battle grounds.  The pen is suffused with the musky scent of blood and
sweat.

A Fortified Alcove~
This small alcove has been carved into the crumbly stone of the canyon
wall.  Vines grow lush and thick about the top of the entrance.  The floor
of packed dirt is strewn with gnawed bones and wood shavings, apparently the
site of many an idle hour.  A low, crude wall of stones has been stacked
partway through the alcove, hiding the back of the alcove from view to the
east.  The alcove narrows gradually towards the back, the stone showing the
many pickaxe scars.  To the east, you are provided with an excellent vantage
point overlooking the board-covered storage pit.

The Raiders\@ Dressing Room~
Rogue background (tentative):

The rogue, known to many as \@hoody\@ or \@Feldyn\@, is in actuality, the first
Raider Lord, Aralor.  After systematically eliminating the other contenders
for his position amongst the original Circle of Twelve, Aralor stood as the
undisputed leader of the Canyon.  Anticipating the onset of old age, Aralor
knew that he could remain the leader of the Canyon for as long as he could
fend off the rising tide of challengers.  

Unwilling to relinquish his hold on power, Aralor appealed to the dark gods
that had empowered the Raiders.  His prayers and sacrifices were soon
answered.  Not only was he granted the immortality he sought, but he was
further gifted with strength beyond that of mortal men, and a supernatural
relation with the shadows of the world.  Aralor rejoiced and marvelled at
his new powerse, believing that they ensured that he would never fade from
the face of Avendar.  

But power comes with a price.  For in attaining his powers, Aralor had
unwittingly ascended to the status of a demigod, and was now bound by the
divine law that binds all immortals.  No longer could he freely inflict
himself upon the world like a cancerous plague.  Instead, the sole object of
his desires now lay behind an invisible shield whose laws and workings lay
beyond his grasp.  

Aralor pleaded with the dark gods for a renegotiation, but after the passing
of several years, he concluded that this was not to be.  Since then, Aralor
has bided his time, perfecting his skills, and scouring the land for ancient
lore regarding his divine bondage.  He maintains a passing interest in the
Raider Canyon, ensuring its permanence in the lands.  However, his long life
has given him perspective and understanding of the cyclical nature of the
balance between the Houses.  He hopes to gain an understanding of the laws
that bind him, and then, true to nature, subvert them, that he may once
again inflict himself upon the lands.
