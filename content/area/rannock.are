A merchant is here, eyeing your purse greedily.

Wearing only the best of clothes, a merchant wanders about in search
of profit for himself. His mottled hair and bloodshot eyes show signs
of his long life near the sea. Strapped to his belt is a quite hefty purse.
He wanders about, glancing at everything about him, sizing it up.

Tanar Gaald, the Duke of Gaald, sits behind a desk.
~
As the second to rule the Port Town of Gaald, Tanar has expanded the
town\@s influence as a port greatly from the times of his father, Hadrar
Gaald.  His solidly built frame was honed handling cargo on the docks he so
skillfully commands, learning, in his youth, all the intricacies of sea
trade and sailing.  He was also trained by the great warrior Firalmol in his
youth, thus he is masterful with weaponry as well.

glorious!  To stand in the presence of the true, unadulterated Flame, as
THEY can, is to know the heat that drives the life of Creation!  What
need have we of gods, who at will can commune with the pure essence of
energy?  For all energies create motion and heat, and it is in Fire that
these find their most perfect expression, untainted by light, as with the
dazed babblings of the ch\@taren, or mass, fit only to shunt the clouds of
the djinni from place to place.  WE know.  WE may immerse ourselves in the

{WPulvervize{x: true to its name, this rune simply but effectively
intensifies all blunt-force damage dealt by the bearer.  When empowered, the
energy of these symbols may even stun those the bearer strikes.  

{WGravitas{x: a perhaps more subtle working of gravitics than is normally
employed, this invocation may bind into an assailants weapon additional
weight, permanently rendering it heavier and thus more unwieldy.  When
empowered, it may furthermore infuse the very bones of the attacker with
density, albeit temporarily.  
~
E
blue2~
{WErosion{x: this rune is singular in its capacity to diminish the life
force of an assailant.  Any who strike at the bearer of such a symbol will
find his life diminished, an effect intensified and renewed with each blow
landed.  Multiple such runes may be employed to hasten the effect, but there
is a limit to how much life force may be so drained.  When empowered, the
effect tends to linger longer.  

{WCalcify{x: those who bear the mark of Calcify risk themselves on a
double-bladed sword, for it is not always advantageous.  Each time such a
one is physically struck in combat the power of rune will fill him,
hardening his body to potentially ignore later blows.  This will make
movement more difficult for the bearer, however, increasing the effort
required to traverse the lands.  Should he invoke additional such runes he
may experience an enhanced effect, but likewise be further slowed in his
movements.  It should be noted that fire can burn away this calcification. 
When empowered, the calcification process takes place notably faster.

(This book is marked as being from the Tarellen collection on ancient
alatharyan runes, the fourth volume of its kind.  It has been printed on
stiff sheets of parchment, bound in a cover of dark blue.)  

We continue our catalogue of those ancient symbols with runes of the fourth
order.  The following such symbols are known to our historians: Adamantine,
Empowerment.  
~
E
blue2~
{WAdamantine{x: this rune is known to draw upon the indomitable nature of
the earth itself, overcoming all in its path.  When used with the earthen
discipline of adamantine invocations, it may hasten the massing of that
selfsame power, reducing the amount of time required to unleash such an
invocation.  Moreover, it will restore the bearer\@s power of invocation more
rapidly, allowing reuse of the discipline sooner.  

Even when not coupled with the adamantine invocation, this rune will help to
overwhelm a foe\@s resistance to magical workings; this is particularly true
when using empowered runes.  
~
E
blue3~
{WEmpowerment{x: unique amongst the ancient known to our art, this symbol
will draw the raw energy of the earth into the object upon which it is
incribed.  Such an object shall be enhanced with permanent power, adding to
its wearer\@s mental reserves.  This effect has been known to slow as more
power is accumulated.  

In addition to this accretion of energy, this rune may empower all other
invoked runes borne by the wearer, granting them additional nuance and
strength, in a fashion not unlike those in runecraft.  Indeed, these
energies will even overlap with and enhance those so trained, allowing for
truly fearsome runeworkings.

the ancient longsword, \@Caien\@mar\@~
An ancient longsword rests here, scribed with runes.~
The longsword \@Caien\@mar\@ is reputed to be the personal weapon of Tourin
Caal, the final king of the fallen empire.  It has remained part of the
Gaald family since the close of the War of Fire, according to local legend. 
The appearance of the weapon seems to confirm this, given that it bears the
curving talons indicative of the ancient Caal eagle-crest tradition.  Its
age and condition also seem to corroborate the stories.  The runes along its
blade are said to cause it to surge with lightning.

ancient longsword runes caein\@mar caein mar~
Signs of wear and age are more than apparent on both the blade and hilt
of this sword.  While the edge is still keen, the steel has dulled to the
point where the only shine on the sword comes from the faintly-glowing
silver tracery of runes running up its length.  To the sides of the
crosspiece are worn engravings of curving talons, though any other features
have long since been lost to the ravages of time.

Call of the Seas
================
  The seas beckon. The salt of surf drifts upon the cool air ocean-side.
I, Eliul, greatest of all Titans who channel the Seas, continue an eternal
vigil by the water\@s edge. Many a unique incantation have I stumbled upon,
my mind wandering across the rolling waves, crests breaking, sea-spray
drenching the energy of conciousness, bequeathing its secrets to my pool of
wisdom. For 500 years have I resided here, pondering, praying, learning the
intricacies of these healing waters, this most powerful of elements. The fires
can burn, devour, consume all which rests in their path, the earth, crushing
opposition with sheer might. Yet, nothing can stop the eternally canonic
course of water. Fluid in all aspects, water can simply adapt to that which
attempts to change its path, as well as soothe and comfort the wounds of
those who know the arts of directing the currents.
  Thus does my study of these arts continue. I shall delve deeper and deeper
into the depths of the oceans, learning, until I learn the essence of the
seas, and see the true form of Jolinn, Father of the Seas themselves. What
follows is the chronicle of the creation of the purest, clearest form of
ocean of all eternity. The Shard of the Seas.
~
E
two~
Nexus of Currents ================= On Iolenday, Month of Converumir, as
my sublime form was immersed in the pondering of the seas, a mighty visage
was cast upon me.  Out of the sea, a tremendous robed figure arose, an aura
of purity issued from his entire being.  The clouds in the sky parted, and
the sun shone through them, illuminating this strange visitor.  He spake a
name, Iduihail, an other-wordly servant of Jolinn.  Iduilhail\@s voice echoed
soundly through the cliffs by the sea, masking the rustling of the scrubs in
the sea breezes.  Frozen with awe, I could do nothing save for listen.  A
massive hand arose from the flowing robes of water, and a finger extended
toward me.  Of pure water, a tentacle struck, surrounding my entire body. 
Lives brought into existence, lives brought to closure, soldiers atop
blood-soaked fields, demonic shuddeni in their caverns of darkness, the gaze
of young lovers, all that ever was, all that ever would be was brought
before my eyes.  These universal currents seemed to form a nexus, and from
this pool of existence, a single thought arose, and embedded itself in my
mind.  This one, indescribable thought, evinced the knowledge that had been
shrouded from my mind.  The sea-master Iduilhail said nothing, as no
explanation was required, and swirled to the watery depths of the sea.  At
long last, I was truely a master of the sea.  
~
E
three~
Teachings of the Seas
=====================
  But a small portion of what the servant of Jolinn had shown me was
required in the development of the incantation that binds the seas,
creating, in but a small globule of water, its essence. I wove the first
Shard, and did proceed to present it to Anirim the Pure, King of all Titans.
He saw within my mind, and recognized the knowledge therein. From that
moment forward, held was I in highest regard among those that studied the
seas.
  The Shard embodies all aspects of the sea. Its fluidity allows it to
change shape in all ways possible, creating tentacles of water that will
do battle with the opponent, as the bearer of the Shard concentrates on
incanting spells upon their opponent. As its healing waters swirl about the
bearer\@s body, they heal wounds sustained in battle. Other knowledge is
locked away within the Shard, but these shall be revealed only to the
dedicated seeker, one who knows the true form of the Seas.

Chapter One:  The First Generation
----------------------------------
  Haerdoth, born on Endenday,  21st of the Month of the Setting, 
but 120 years prior to the War of Fire. The son of a sailor from a
small fishing village at the northwestern corner of the frigid, gray  
Uthlin, whose name still remains buried in time. Mightly blood, as if
from some divine creature coursed through his veins. He was known far 
and wide as one of the greatest warriors to ever grace Avendar. Little
else is known of his life, until his 25th year. Here, the scrolls of Caal
begin their accounts of his efforts to create the Kingdom of Caal. A 
mighty sovereignty that stretched from the northern shores of whence he
came over the vast grasslands to the west, a massive, well-trained army
defending its walls. In a span of 15 years, he united thousands, 
creating in a short time, a mighty empire known throughout Avendar.
  In Haerdoth Caal\@s 40th year, the Lady Siya Kijan, daughter of a wealthy
merchant, became queen, ushering in a sense of nationalism and faith in 
the Crown of Caal, with the births of their son and daughter. 
  Caal prospered and flourished, an ally to all who suffered strife, its
reknown for aid to the weak waxed mightily.

Chapter Two:  The Second Generation
-----------------------------------
  Born in King Haerdoth\@s 41st year, the twins Siri and Indar Caal brought
a sense of lasting to the empire that the great Haerdoth had so quickly
built. Years passed, and Haerdoth lived to see 18 more years of his empire
flourishing, before his death. Queen Siya lived only a year longer than he,
and that year, spent stricken with grief.
  After a great period of sadness for the Kingdom of Caal, Indar assumed
the throne left empty by his father. After marrying Synove Issar, of whom
nothing is known, save her name, he proceeded to expand the land in the
name of Caal northward, claiming parts of the Brintor mountains, and 
westward, to the Arein Plains.  Little is known of the events in 
his sister Siri\@s life, save that she married Wathar Schin, and bore a
daughter to him, Pala Schin.

three~
Chapter Three  The Third Generation
-----------------------------------
  Three sons were born to the line, Trarfrid, Xance, and Glaren. Prior to
King Indar\@s death, he divided Caal into three nations, each ruled 
by one of his sons. For whatever reasons, the history and descendents
of Trarfrid and Xance were not written down. Glaren, on the other hand,
and his wife, Finae Gwyddyth, had two sons, Tourin and Brakan. 
  In spite of the split in the power of Caal, the rules of these three
brothers were uneventful. They concentrated less on territorial expansion,
and more on the advancement of their armies.

four~
Chapter Four:  The Fourth Generation
------------------------------------
  Prince Tourin grew, in his youth, to be reknown as the greatest warrior
in Caal\@s ranks. At a young age, his mind was forever pondering strategies,
and his body training for battle. He quickly rose in the ranks of the
Caal military, being annointed a general by his 18th year. His brother
and his caladaran wife Cailisska on the other hand, fell victim to a 
plague which attacked Caal at that time.  As his father and brothers aged,
he was coronated King of a united Caal. Jaefe Tullia, the queen, bore 
two daughters and three sons to the line, shortly before the great inferno
bore down on Avendar, leaving only ash in its wake.
~
E
five~
Chapter Five:  The Fifth Generation
-----------------------------------
  The fifth generation would spell the end of the bloodline of Caal. 
The War of Fire, which ravaged and decimated most of Avendar, did serve,
under the guise of the srryn fire templar Ssanthal, Fire Brand of Sythys,
whose magic burned the mighty empire of Caal to the ground. All of the
line of Caal who lived therein were ruthlessly slaughtered, save the eldest
child of Tourin, Riia, who was miraculously saved from the inferno. The 
majestic battlements, tall spires, and monolithic castles of the proud
Kingdom of Caal, all were consumed by the fire.
~

six~
Chapter Six:  The Scribe\@s Epilogue
-----------------------------------
  Only a few of the many parchments containing the short, but rich history
of Caal survived the hand of Ssanthal. Nothing is known of what happened
to the child Riia after her escape from the desctruction, but, theories 
abound. Many suspect it was she who was amongst the original few who
learned the magics of the water directly from the Titans, and later 
exacted her revenge on Ssanthal for the slaying of her family. Others 
suspect she may have intertwined the line of Caal with that of the later
empires of Fahn and Gaald. Many bloodlines claim that they are direct descendants of
the Lady Riia, though such cannot be proven.

The Epic Poem of Fahn and Uhl
-----------------------------
  Upon the shores o\@er cliff and cave,
Of the Sea of Lidreau, a crashing wave,
Salt and surf spray upon the trees, 
The cool wind whistles through the leaves,
A tabor beat upon the breeze,
The clouds in the sky look o\@er the land.
   
From watery depths a beast did hail,
A firey tongue wound round its tail,
An eye of opal braced with scales,
Sword-like were its massive nails,
Which scratched and clawed the cliffs,
As the beast ascended to the land.
   
A stocky man of gnarled skin,
Drank all day and night of gin,
Nearly by this shore did dwell,
Fahn his name for all to tell,
Did see this monster wake from by the rocks,
And fell in fear to the sea soaked land.
  
A brother \@mongst his monstrous kin,
Name of Uhl did see herein,
This beast arise and drew his sword,
From his smoke filled den of stench abhorred,
Thrust it to the scaly beast,
Who tossed him to the land.
Fahn and Uhl saw the beast as it slew,
A nearby town of fisherman new,
Houses burned by pillars of fire,
Women and children swallowed by montrous mire,
Cast off previous deeds of evil,
And made haste to the monster, weapon in hand.
  
Fishermen of the town, knowing of these gnarled men,
And their many deeds of evil towards the very land,
Did expel them for fear of pillage and burn,
But Uhl and Fahn did have a plan, to aid them in return,
They launched mightily upon the beast,
And proud and strong were they to battle there.
  
Evading fire, tooth, and claw,
Did they plunge into the beast\@s maw,
Their swords did flash and flail in spite,
Blood glinting in the morning\@s light,
The beasts life drained slowly away,
Soaking full the rocky sea-side land.
  
Those of the town did laugh and sing with glee,
Seeing Uhl and Fahl, those they did despise,
Greatest of their gratitude, and friendship was bestowed,
Upon these who henceforth were to be mortally owed,
Now as those of the village were they,
No longer monsters to be slain.

A Shrine to Chadraln~
An alcove built into the south wall of the Gaald library opens to reveal
a luminescent shrine.  The tall glass pillars around you have been molded
into great hourglasses.  Inside of them, sand endlessly trickles down though
the narrow neck from the upper to lower chamber, though the later is hardly
full.  These magical pillars hold up a ceiling made from the clearest glass,
allowing you to see the sky above.  The floor you stand on depicts a map of
Avendar; the details of which are marvelously in-depth and intricate.  Set
in the center of the shrine is an altar of gray marble, upon which rests a
large opened book with a quill resting in the seam.  A tranquil silence
permeates the room, allowing one to hear their inner most thoughts.

Path by Wooded Ocean Shore~
A sandy ocean shore far off to the west stretches north and south,
surrounding the beaten path that now diverges from its course along the
shoreline, as does the path of the shoreline change, forming a fair sized
peninsula with a small town upon it, far to the west.  Few if any remnants
of the thick oak forests to the northeast remain, replaced instead by
pebbles, shale, and fallen boulders from the towering, horizon dominating
Yagash mountains far to the east.  The path below is deeply grooved and
spotted with tracks of animals, people, and caravans of goods, and stretches
both to the north as well as the east.

The Gates to Port Gaald~
Sitting atop a small peninsula is the small port town of Gaald.  The
massive gates to the town are carved of oak, and encroached upon by a number
of vines of ivy.  The gates, which are set in a thick granite frame, seem
slightly warped by the permeation of moist air from the ocean that surrounds
the peninsula, far off in the distance.  To the east, the beaten path below
continues, whereas to the west, the town of Gaald awaits.

Inside the Gates of Gaald~
Inside the gates, a bustling port town sprawls about.  Northward
stretches Uhl Road, flanked by numerous shops.  Southward, Uhl Road
continues, lined with inns and taverns.  The houses and shops, worn by the
salty sea air that fills the town, appear to be in need of upkeep.  To the
west, under an entry arch, is the stables.  The sounds of the foundry in the
southwest corner of the town ring out, as metal is forged for the
construction of the ships.

Uhl Road~
Uhl Road stretches from the northern to southern wall.  A cool, salty sea
breeze moves across the town, and the calls of sea birds can be heard above.
Far off to the west, above all else, a towering lighthouse can be seen.  To
either side of the worn cobblestones, for the entire length of the road, are
stores.  To the west is a small building with a rune engraved upon the front
door.  An armory lies east.

cobblestones, for the entire length of the road, are stores.  To the west
lies a building with a gauntlet brazen atop a shield, mounted upon the ashen
front door.  Ivory statues flank the doors of the building to the east.

Uhl Road~
Uhl Road stretches from the northern to southern wall.  The calls of sea
birds rings out above the massive ruckus of sound from the Foundry to the
southwest.  A lighthouse can be seen far off to the west, taller than all
else.  To either side of the worn cobblestones, for the entire length of the
road, are stores.  To the north lies the shop of the Gaald cartographer. 
Eastward, supplies for the repair of seabound vessels can be purchased in
the Shop of the Seas.  To the west, Caal Road begins, lined with houses of
trade.

Caal Road~
Worn of many feet, Caal Road is the center of trade in the Port of Gaald.
Lined with auction houses and places of trade, gold flows more freely here
than anywhere else.  A salty sea breeze twists about the town, and a
tremendous lighthouse can be seen in the distance, above all else.  To the
north is Laen\@s Auctionhouse.  Southward lies a tremendous trading
warehouse, bearing a massive sign depicting the fall of a great castle.

Caal Road~
Worn of many feet, Caal Road is the center of trade in the Port of Gaald.
Lined with auction houses and places of trade, gold flows more freely here
than anywhere else.  As an ocean breeze rolls across the town, birds calling
can be heard over the noise of the Foundry to the southwest.  To the north
is the Sea Maiden Trading House.  The Angel\@s Shield Armory lies west, under
an arch, canopied of white leaves.  A road of much darker cobblestones
begins south, Fahn Street, flanked on the east by the massive trading house,
and to the west with shops and homes.

Fahn Street~
The cobblestones of Fahn Street are notably darker in hue than those of
other streets in Gaald.  Each stone seems to have been cut to a known
pattern.  The street is lined on either side by small obsidian statues of a
wolf.  To the east lies an entry arch to the large trading house.  The house
of the Duke of Gaald, a veritable palace of gold, lies to the west. 
Southward, the dark stones of Fahn Street continue, stopping abruptly at the
towering Foundry far to the south.

entrance to the massive Foundry far in the distance.

Fahn Street~
The cobblestones of Fahn Street are notably darker in hue than those of
other streets in Gaald.  Each stone seems to have been cut to a known
pattern.  The street is lined on either side by small obsidian statues of a
wolf.  To the east lies an entry arch to the large trading house.  To the
west, a few humble houses stand, residing in their walls the citizens of the
small town.  Far to the south, the Foundry can be seen and well heard, with
Fahn Street continuing up to the front doors.

The cobblestones of Fahn Street are notably darker in hue than those of
other streets in Gaald.  Each stone seems to have been cut to a known
pattern.  The street is lined on either side by small obsidian statues of a
wolf.  A sea borne breeze rolls across the city, and birds can be heard
calling in the sky above.  Aeldrar Street lies to east, the smallest street
in the city.  The jotundric Foundry rises into the sky close by south, as
Fahn Street approaches its massive doors.

Aeldrar Street~
Joining Uhl Road and Fahn Street, Aeldrar Street is comparatively small. 
Constructed of cobblestones lighter in hue than those of the other streets,
Aeldrar is, though, easily distinguishable, as it skirts the only theater in
all of Gaald.  From inside the impressive theater, music of the most skilled
of bards, and speech from the most adept of actors can be heard, mingling
with the gentle salty breezes drifting across the town.  To the west, the
dark Fahn Street continues its path between the Foundry and the northern
town wall.  To the east, Uhl Road performs a similar task, yet linking
taverns with the shops of the north end.

Hyadth\@s Stables~
Seemingly well-kempt for its purpose, the stables smell still of horse
manure and hay.  The boards which brace the tall ceiling are bedecked with
well used swords and armors.  The spacious horse stalls are formed of only
the finest timbers, and appear to be constructed with care.  Uhl Road begins
eastward, directly inside the gates.

Fair in size, Ilarinya\@s Scholar Shop is home to the most powerful of
mystic objects in the town.  Under the unusually high ceiling, numerous
shelves of potions, scrolls, books, wands, and various enchanted stones are
set into the wall.  A strange glow surrounds nearly the entire shop, as the
tremendous power of the collected enchantments mingles and intermixes.  A
large table, bedecked with runes rests at the back wall, while to the east,
a simple door leads out to Uhl Road.

Uhl Road~
Uhl Road stretches from northern to southern ends of the town.  A salty
breeze rolls across the town, bringing with it the sound of birds calling
from above the sea.  The Foundry at the southwest corner of the town
radiates a rumbling unparalleled about the town.  The Sea Dragon Inn lies to
the east, walls full of many a window.  A pair of double doors to the south
serves as the entrance to the Aeldrar Tavern.  Aeldrar Street to the west
links Uhl Road with Fahn Street.

crates by the thousands are tossed about, smelling of fish and salt.  A musk
fills the air about the entire store, though concentrated largely upon the
front desk.  In the eastern wall, a door stands, though barely visible
through the haze.  To the west, a small wooden door leads to Uhl Road.

Maps layer the table at which the wares can be purchased, and are scattered
about the floor below.  Dust from the ancient tomes of navigation floats
about the room in clouds.  Southward through the door, lies Uhl Road.

wafting about the trading house.  Smaller than the more noteworthy Call\@s
Fall trading house, the Sea Maiden house specializes more in various exotic
foods than in the more general purpose wares of the former.  Through the
doors to the south lies Caal Road.

are contained in a small bookshelf next to the bed, a small statue atop it. 
Parchments are piled on a small table flanking the bed to the other side, a
quill pen sitting next to them.  The Duke\@s Office lies through a door to

stench of sweat emanate from the floors above, where titanic boilers and
workers rest, ever vigilant in the construction of materials for the ships
which are the town\@s livelyhood.  North, through iron doors, lies Fahn
Street.  The foreman\@s office lies to the south, through fastly closed

north.  The salty sea breeze moves through this tunnel more rapidly,
carrying upon it the sound of the ocean waves in the distance to the west. 
A tall lighthouse can seen on a tiny island far out to sea.

The Gaald Docks~
Beneath the thick planks of the docks, the choppy ocean crashes, spewing
salt and surf into the moist air.  Sea birds circle overhead, calling out
over the bustling noise of cargo being unloaded and feet on the boards of
the docks.  A crisp sea breeze brushes through the area.  Far out in the
vast blue ocean stretching infinitely to the west, floats an island,
towering lighthouse upon it.  To the north, south and west, the docks and
salty sea air continue.  Fahn Street, and the town, lie east.

The Dockmaster Station~
With deep bay windows of clear glass, trimmed in dark mahogany, the
Dockmaster Station offers clear views of the vast, rolling blue ocean, and
the bustling docks.  A ladder climbs the western wall to the observation
posts on the roof.  Built of sturdy lumber, the Dockmaster\@s desk rests near
the western wall, guarding the ladder, cluttered with maps and parchments. 
The salty sea air moves about the room, creeping through the ladder
entrance.  Sounds of the docks are audible to the east.

The Observation Post~
Constructed of warped planks and encircled by a thick, wrought iron
guard rail, the Observation Post offers a majestic view of the surrounding
ocean and port town.  The planks creak as the salty sea breeze blows across
them, warping them yet further.  Flying the Duke\@s coat of arms is a tall
flagpole erected in the platform\@s center.

The Duke\@s Office~
Carved simply, devoid of the platitudinous opulence displayed throughout
the Duke\@s House, pieces of parchment are arranged in organized piles upon
the Duke\@s desk, along with a fresh quill pen and ink.  The windows in the
western wall are miniscule, as those of a monk\@s cell.  Thick red carpet as
that of the rest of the building contrasts the simplicity of the desk and
walls, devoid of decoration or sculpture.  Through a door to the north lies
the Duke\@s Chambers, and down a flight of steps lies a room with a circle of
benches.

A Dank Supply Room~
Sturdy wooden crates and barrels are stacked to the ceiling here, covered
in dust and grime.  Few noises are audible, save the clattering of rat\@s
feet, and the slow dripping of water.  A small door in the warped ceiling
planks is loosely attached on rusted iron hinges, though it is used often. 
Another trap door, similar to that of the ceiling, is embedded in the floor.

Brightly lit by many torches, this underground library is lined with many
sturdy bookshelves, packed with books.  A low ceiling supported by round
pillars stands opposite the blue carpeted floor.  Several chairs are
scattered around for those studying Gaald\@s rich past to sit upon.  The
musky smell of the more ancient tomes is only made more stifling by the low
hang of the ceiling, which is adorned with many a painting depicting
historic events.  In addition, several large parchments are mounted one the
walls of the library.  A flight of steps leads up, while the library
continues to the south and east.  
A sign is posted on the wall.

Path to a Small Town~
Waves crashing on the rocky shores of the peninsula far off to the north
and south permeates the air with moisture, while the mixture of sand and
rock surrounding the beaten path makes the ground here rough.  Far to the
east, the massive Yagash mountains dominate the skyline, and to the north of
them, a dense oak forest.  A number of different tracks and markings have
been left in the path below, most notably those of large caravans carrying
goods to and from the town far to the west.  A small rocky trail leads off
to the south.

Entrance to the Bandit\@s Blade Tavern~
Filled with smoke, and poorly lit, this room serves as an entryway to a
tavern eastward.  The rooms walls and ceiling are built of cracked, warped
wood, and the floor built of solid stone.  No light is provided for this
room, save that which flows forth from the tavern to the east.  Built
indiscreetly in the ceiling is a small trapdoor, and a wiry, rickety ladder
leads up to it.

A Back Room in the Bandit\@s Blade Tavern~
Under a low ceiling shrouded in cigar smoke lie the numerous tables of
this large tavern.  The floor is covered in bits of food and cloth, and the
floor boards are scratched and scuffed, presumably from numerous duels and
confrontations that take place here.  The walls of this room are
considerably nearer each other than those of the rest of the tavern,
allowing for fewer tables to be fit into it.  To the east, the main part of
the tavern begins.
