Voright~
A weathered, white-bearded human sits behind the desk.
~
A thin and elderly human, Voright the Master Traveller sits behind his
desk.  Eyes considering and clear rest under sharp white brows, and the thin
mouth is dressed in a trim white beard.  Wearing simple, well-used
travellers\@ clothes, Voright looks nearly as worn his garments.  There is no
attempt at hiding his missing left leg--his trousers are sewn off on the
left side, just above knee height.  He patiently waits on fellow adventurers
who wish to compare their accomplishments with other master travellers of
the realm.  

A legend among the Wanderers, Voright was once nicknamed Bootwings, due to
a bet he made with Tzajai.  Winning the bet, he was given magical winged
boots to aid in his journeying.  These boots imparted amazing flight powers,
and were able to lift Voright beyond the clouds, to heights unheard of even
by the air mages.  Espying the lands from such great distances, he gained
unparalleled expertise in geography and mapping.  However, one day the
boots\@ enchantment failed without warning, and Voright was fortunate to come
out alive, and with only one limb lost.

Isami~
A woman with long silver hair sits quietly behind the desk.
~
Isami sits here, radiating a sense of patient calm.  Her face is
partially hidden by her long silver-white hair, which is parted centerwise,
one half cascading forward and the other half swept back.  The visible eye
is a piercing green, framed in fine wrinkles that speak to Isami\@s
significant age and experience.  Her lips are settled into her customary
half-smile.  

Known as \#Isami the Collector\# since her youthful days as a factor for the
Earendam Patrician, where her honesty led to quick rise in position, she
retired early from office and spent several years traveling the wilds with
Olnan.  Now content to assist the Wanderers as treasurer, she provides
valuable financial advising and maintains close connections with the
financial institutions supported by the merchant guilds in Earendam and Var
Bandor.

Kelunt warrior alatharya old~
Kelunt~
An old alatharya warrior stands here, arms folded.
~
An old alatharya stands here, wearing nothing more than a belted kilt and 
sandals. Tall and barrel-chested, even in his advanced years Kelunt 
presents a daunting form, and age seems to have softened him little. Limbs
are still corded with hard muscle, as are his thick neck and massive 
shoulders. His silvery skin is marred with countless pale scars, including
one which  runs up from his left jawline, across his face, to the stump where
his right ear once was. The warrior\@s hair is bound into three thick white 
braids which cascade down his back. He stands at the ready to assess the 
boldest duelists and combatants in the realms.
    
Known as the Anvil of the Invincibles during his youth, Kelunt served in
the ranks of the Forgemaster for decades, winning renown on countless
battlefields. He gained much infamy for leading the Invincibles in siding
with the Scourge during the final days of the Eyeblight War, declaring the
Surface Alliance corrupted by politicans more dedicated to manipulating 
developments to their favor rather than finishing the conflict honorably.
His distinct facial scar is said to have come from the holy sword Shadrist
wielded by the hands of Lord Malyn.

Usmaan merchant bulky man southern~
Usmaan the merchant~
A bulky man, dressed in the flowing robes of a southern merchant, sits on the end of the bed.
~
This heavy-set man\@s considerable girth is draped in the flowing,
colourful robes of a merchant from Ashta Harrud.  The phlegmatic expression
on his deeply-tanned face suggests a peaceful demeanor, and yet one both
determined and shrewd.  Although accustomed to his creature comforts, he
appears ready to defend his fortune with his life.

Vakara~
A fiery young woman with anxious eyes lingers in the meeting hall.
~
Vakara is a fiery woman with a fall of bright red hair.  Her skin is fair
and freckled, and her smile as vibrant as it is rapacious.  One of Alil\@s
rare devoted, she openly bears the mark of the lotus.  Once a scholar of Var
Bandor, she abandoned her guild studies to more fully embrace a lifestyle
without boundaries.  She has not lost her talent for magic, however, and
uses it in the service of her tumultuous desires.  After meeting Olnan, she
joined his Wanderers of Avendar for the sake of her own amusement and
edification.

This charcoal-grey nefortu rests from his many journies.  Dressed in
travelworn clothing coated with the dust of many roads, he looks like little
more than a scruffy vagabond.  Once from Rahh-Nefor, he left the sea-cave in

of Avendar, and aids in securing a new haven for their fledgling party.

held up with pillars of air.  Maps and charts litter the tent, covering the
top of a large desk which stands against one wall of the tent and lying in
small piles in various other locations.  To the south, the entrance of the
tent provides access to the savannah below.

A Dark Room~
A single torch, its blaze extinguished, remains in its holder, the other
appearing to have been removed and not replaced.  A low cot has been placed
against the western wall under the torch, and a large bookcase stands near
the door leading south into the hallway, utterly devoid of books.  A
portrait of a noble-looking nefortu hangs on the back wall.

A thin layer of dust has settled onto the empty shelves of this large
bookcase.  Small scraps of paper indicate that books have been kept here,
but none remain.

E
portrait~
This portrait hangs on the back wall of the private room.  It depicts a
noble-looking nefortu sitting in a low-backed padded chair.  A plaque at the
bottom of the portrait indicates that the nefortu was an ancestor of Djolak.

The Savannah Road~
Connecting the savannah with Nendor to the north, this road cuts a wide
path north and south through the grass.  Small white stones line both sides
of the path, a thin boundary separating the road from the intruding grass. 
The grass on either side of the path is thick and lush, but remains
passable. The trees of the forest end here abruptly, forming a clean
division between woods and grasslands.  The savannah spreads out away from
the forest to the south.

Before Some Tents~
Atop a small hill, this camp lies in the midst of the lush grasslands. 
The ground is not overly rocky, with only occasional stones marring the
otherwise smooth dirt.  To the east a large campfire is visible, smoke
rising above the ever-present fire.  The side of a large red tent lies to
the south.  To the north, a brown tent has been erected, and to the east a
dark blue tent stands, both accessible from this part of the camp.

A Small Tent~
Brown canvas descends from the tent poles, forming the walls of this
small tent.  The dirt which comprises the floor is well packed, though
occasional piles of loose dust have collected against the contents of the
tent.  Several large crates lay stacked in the back of the tent, and a huge
assemblage of sacks threatens to fill the remaining space.  An old, rusted
lantern rests on the stack of crates, filling the tent with its dim light. 
The only exit is through the tent flaps on the south side of the tent.

A Dark Blue Tent~
A dark blue material forms the walls of this tent.  Several bedrolls lie
on the ground, thick bags woven from the skins of some animal.  Various
other household items are scattered haphazardly about on the floor of the
tent.  In the back of the tent, a small pile of skins has been placed, and a
broken spear lies in two pieces on a small table in a corner.  At the
western end of the tent the tent flaps permit exit from the tent.

The Edge of a Forest~
Colliding with the thick wall of the forest to the north, the savannah
has reached its northern end.  A clear division exists between the forest
and the grass, the trees forming a solid impassable border.  The grass of

road passes through the savannah, while to the northeast the peak of Mount
Enrien rises into the clouds above the accompanying hills.  The savannah

this lake provides water for the creatures of the savannah.  Despite its
size, the lake is not very deep.  A thick layer of mud surrounds the water,
imprinted with the tracks of many animals.  Around the mud, the grass is
thick and lush, but remains passable.  The lake continues to the south,
while off to the north a range of hills is visible.  To the east, the grass
thickens, becoming impassable.

The Middle of the Savannah~
Spreading out over the land, the savannah continues in every direction. 
The grass of the savannah is thick and lush, but remains passable.  Small
rocks and bushes are interspersed amidst the grass, and an occasional tree
dots the landscape, providing meager shelter.  Off to the west it appears as
if the savannah disappears completely, but no other landmarks are visible.

Near to the hills that rise up in the southeast, this thin strip of
ground runs between a large hill and the massive cliff to the west.  A small
stream rushes down the hillside here, crossing the strip before cascading
over the cliff into the swampy waste below.  Large stones in the streambed
provide for easy crossing of the stream, so it is possible to walk both

The Middle of the Savannah~
Spreading out over the land, the savannah continues in every direction. 
The grass of the savannah is thick and lush, but remains passable.  Small
rocks and bushes are interspersed amidst the grass and an occasional tree
dots the landscape, providing meager shelter.  To the north, the shore of a

A Chain of Hills~
Almost into the hills that rise above the savannah in the west, the
savannah has reached its western end.  The hills are steep and impassable,
towering over the grasslands.  The grass of the savannah is thick and lush,
but remains passable.  The savannah passes along the edge of the hills to
the north and south, and heads away from the hills to the east.  Thick
bushes grow against the nearest hill in the west.  A large, fortified
building has been constructed against the base of the hill, its entry hall
directly to the west.

caskets overflowing with coin.  On the east wall there is also a wooden
board tacked with a parchment.  Below the board is a small desk, with
parchments, inkwell and quills covered in notes on trade rates, account
balances, and other financial matters.  A stool stands behind the desk,

This granite-walled room is wide and spacious, with a high-vaulted
ceiling resting on huge wooden brace beams.  A thin rush mat in the center
of the room appears to be used for combat training.  The walls are bare,
save for a series of sconces set with gems glowing with a bright white
light, providing ample illumination throughout the large chamber.  A single
open doorway in the northern walls it the only visible exit or entrance.

A Spacious Hall~
This tall, square room is built from square blocks of alternating light 
granite and a dark, banded gneiss, forming a checkered pattern.  Four 
ornamental pillars of striated grey marble stand in each of the corners, 
fitted with torch-bearing sconces.  A large set of sturdy wooden doors 
stands in the eastern wall, thick iron hinges and rows of studded 
florin-spikes making it quite formidable.  An open archway leads south to 
some type of hall, and small doors squat in the northern and 
western walls.  The ceiling above is a slightly vaulted continuation of the 
walls, the patterned blocks curving to a central point.  Directly 
below, a jet of water sprays into the air, falling back into a carved black 
marble basin.  A circular bench surrounds the fountain, made of the 
same polished marble.

This small, austere room serves both as an office and entryway to the
hallway and offices further to the west.  Built from dark granite, the
room\@s ceiling and walls are bare and unadorned but for two matching
shelves, centered in the northern and southern walls.  These shelves, built
beneath twin skylights, are lined with various exotic flowers in white pots.
A small door to the east leads into the main entry hall of the fortress.  A
plain desk of some light wood sits in the center of the room, a few small
nibs and papers scattered across the surface.  A small stool sits behind the
desk, and a single chair faces it, back to the door.

A Meeting Hall~
This long meeting hall is dominated by an enormous wooden table crafted 
from a single, gigantic tree trunk.  Two disproportionately immense 
chairs stand at the head and foot of the table, the former lined with 
embroidered red satin, and the latter with a rich blue damask.  Several far 
smaller chairs, made of carved wood, line the sides.  The roof curves 
far above in a seamless, formed-stone dome.  Below the dome on the 
eastern wall a small stained-glass window depicts a white-draped woman, 
hands folded across her chest as if in prayer.  Torches are interspersed 
with small, bland paintings of scenery along the walls behind the chairs.  
An open archway leads north into a smaller room.

Entrance to a Ruined Temple~
Once the entrance into a great stone temple, time has reduced this room
into a ruin.  Few of the large stone pillars which once held up the roof of
this enclosure remain standing, the rest toppled and crumbling through
neglect.  The roof is pitted with holes, and a large section has collapsed,
cutting off the entrance into the temple proper.  The savannah grasses,
whose thick growth around the temple prevents exit, have began to claim the
inside as well, filling the gaps between the cracked floorstones.  A rotting
pile of grass and fur lies in one corner of the room, and bones and
droppings litter the floor.
