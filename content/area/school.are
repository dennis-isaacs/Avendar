Arafis Tindel~
An aging gate guard stands here, welcoming new arrivals.
~
The retired adventurer Arafis Tindel stands watch over the wrought iron
gates of the School of Heroes.  A human of advancing years, he distinguished
himself in the defense of Earendam during the fourth Kankoran War.  Only a
young water templar, he challenged some of the invaders and protected a
number of the city guard.  After being recognized for his valor, he took a
position at the famed School of Heroes as its ceremonial gate guard.  His
face is a bit haggard and sports a well-trimmed beard, its salt and pepper
look matching his short hair.

Loqel Arastha~
An olive-green ethron clad in brown robes directs young adventurers.
~
Loqel Arastha is a burly, stoic ethron from the forest of Qilarn.  Once a
part of the Eqiril clan, he set out on his own as a youth to make his
fortune.  Although he wandered for a much of his young adulthood, he was
enamoured by life within the School of Heroes.  He, in turn, decided that he
could best venerate his goddess, Lielqan, by serving within its walls.  He
spends his days and nights directing young heroes to their respective
destinies, be they for better or worse.

Aiasha Ly\@rae~
A silver-haired ch\@taren girl guides the pure-hearted.
~
A tall, attractive ch\@taren girl named Aiasha Ly\@rae serves as the
School\@s acolyte of dawn.  Born in Jh\@ten on the isle of Alensha, she has
traveled far in the service of her faith.  Like virtually all of her race,
she seems timeless, her beauty and golden shimmer frozen in perpetual youth.
Her silver hair is short and wild, and her vibrant green eyes are alive with
mischief.  She is tasked with aiding young heroes in knowing themselves and
the movements of their souls.  A small teardrop tattoo glitters beside her
left eye.

Eronth Todok~
A towering, armored alatharya soldier stands beside the dais.
~
The towering, muscular figure of Eronth Todok bears all of the ancient
majesty of the alatharyan race.  His features are chiseled and stern, and
his long white hair is pulled back into a high ponytail.  His silvery skin
and dark eyes both suggest some experience as a traveler.  He serves the
School of Heroes as its acolyte of balance, and is a well-known believer in
the goddess, Enirra.  He is dressed in a few pieces of platemail, but has
left his imposing arms bare.  When he speaks, it is only to lead the young
to the adjoining chambers.

Jajikk~
A gaunt, robed shuddeni keeps a quiet vigil.
~
Jajikk is a robed shuddeni tasked with guarding the Chamber of Night. 
His presence within the School is unusual, with many swirling rumors as to
where he is from and to what clan he was born.  He is gaunt, with grey,
sagging skin that glistens with expensive Yithoulian oil.  Like all
shuddeni, he has no eyes, and his ridged face adheres to an alien aesthetic
that only they can truly understand.  He directs young travelers to those
chambers which will speak to the darkness within their souls and ensures
that the braziers which flank the altar remain filled with burning coals.

More magic than matter, this disembodied mouth is little more than a set

within the School during its original construction and never saw fit to
leave.  Since then, it has become something of a mascot, and a celebrated
addition to the School lounge.  It is said to not be bound by planar space,
and inhabits all of its favorite locations at once.

Judicas Alisto~
A dour, dark-haired healer keeps watch over the altar.

The healer Judicas Alisto is one of the many students of the Tower of
Salyra in Earendam.  After spending a number of years aiding the city\@s sick
and wounded, both in the Tower and its expansive undercity, he was rewarded
for his diligence with opportunity.  Archmage Lydara, the city\@s most
well-known Water scholar, recommended him for a new position opening within
the School of Heroes.  He graciously accepted, and vowed to use his magic to
assist young heroes in their beginnings.  He is tall and dark haired,
although his demeanor is often a grave one.

Mehtai Vazlen balding white haired white-haired alchemist man~
Mehtai Vazlen~
A balding, white-haired alchemist stares at his glassware.
~
An alchemist who studies with the Erudite Eye, Mehtai Vazlen is
considered as insane as he is brilliant.  The top of his head is balding,
with wispy white hair that hangs low over his neck.  He has spent hours in
this disorganized laboratory, doing his best to create new and novel
potions.  His efforts have not always been successful; his laboratory used
to be closer to the personal quarters of the School staff until a number of
\#accidents\# occurred.  His workspace was relocated into the Hall of Trials,
so his creations ostensibly serve the School mission.

Teloqi short well built well-built ethron girl druid~
Teloqi~
A short, well-built ethron girl waits at the poolside.
~
Teloqi is a short, well-built ethron girl with pale green skin.  Her hair
is a mess of deep green ringlets, which hang down to either side of her
heart-shaped face.  The outline of a leaf has been tattooed over the left
half of her face in a darker shade of green.  Once a druid of the Nendorin
order, she left her forest home to become an adventurer.  After a near-fatal
accident during her travels, she was nursed to health by Kashelle Eroq. 
When she recovered, she and Kashelle came to the School of Heroes together
to train and teach.

Rshil~
A black scaled srryn with a rotting left arm avoids the shadows.
~
A large, black-scaled srryn, Rshil came to the School of Heroes for
refuge.  He refused to explain what exactly he was trying to escape, but
when the School staff saw him, they knew he was in dire need.  His left arm
is not black at all, but rather an unhealthy, decaying grey-green.  Water
scholars at the School were unable to determine the nature of his
affliction, but agreed to allow him to stay.  His talents lie in the way of
the Serpent, and he has since agreed to assist the School with some of their
testing in the Hall of Trials.

Arriden scruff thick waisted thick-waisted human thief~
Arriden~
A scruffy, thick-waisted human looks meaningfully at the pile of junk.
~
Arriden is an overweight human with a bulging waist line.  His hair is
scraggly and grey, and he has a similarly discheveled grey beard.  He was
once an adventurer, but during the course of his travels, he gained an
unnatural fondness for collection.  When he arrived at the School of Heroes,
he was carrying eight different swords and two entire sets of armor in a
heavy pack.  He was ostracized by almost everyone for his hoarding ways, and
was only allowed to stay if he gave up some of his collection.  He
reluctantly agreed, and spends his hours searching through the School\@s junk
room for forgotten treasures.

Shiguln~
A dark-skinned giant blocks the eastern passage.
~
A monstrous dark-skinned creature named Shiguln serves as the guardian of
the Hall of Victors.  His milk-white eyes and expanse of thick body-hair are
common for a chaja, although he keeps far cleaner than most.  Having escaped
from his shuddeni masters at a young age, he wandered aimlessly until a kind
soul brought him to the School of Heroes.  Knowing that he would not be safe
if they forced him to leave, the School staff allowed him to stay.  He
watches the entrance to the Hall, allowing only those branded with the
School\@s sigil to pass.

Eliaj Onat is an overweight male nefortu who serves on the Var Bandor
Merchant Council.  His tiny, bat-like stature gives him a far rounder shape
than he may deserve.  His hairless face is amiable but shrewd, his eyes
bright and attentive.  On assignment from the Council, he works within the
School of Heroes, seeing to the delivery of packages to the various guilds
within the city.  His cleverness in suggesting young adventurers serve as
unpaid couriers backfired when the Council required him to oversee all of
their distribution personally.

the magic mouth~
A magic mouth hovers in mid-air, grinning nonchalantly.
~
More magic than matter, this disembodied mouth is little more than a set
of rich red lips.  Its origin is a mystery of sorts, as it simply appeared
within the School during its original construction and never saw fit to
leave.  Since then, it has become something of a mascot, and quizzes young
adventurers on Avendarian history.  It is said to not be bound by planar
space, and inhabits all of its favorite locations at once.

Kajach~
A brown-furred kankoran with broad shoulders waits with arms crossed.
~
Kajach is a brown-furred kankoran warrior who administers the Test of
Belief.  He is tall, with broad shoulders, and the cast of his wolfen
features is no less than predatory.  Originally from the Rirro Jagka, he
made the dangerous journey to the Dantaron river valley in search of his
fortune.  After an unsuccessful stint as a pirate on the Uthlin Ocean, he
found his way to the School of Heroes.  He petitioned to join the School
staff after meeting Koranna, and devised the Test of Belief to impress her. 
He spends most of his hours teaching young adventurers that not everything
they see can be taken at face value.

Kajjias~
A disinterested shuddeni sits quietly in the corridor.
~
A disinterested looking shuddeni, Kajjias has been employed by the School
of Heroes to aid them with the Test of Keys.  A student of the Void, his
ability with the sphere is enough to include the conjuration of rudimentary
demons.  It quickly became apparent to him that the guildmasters whom he
served intended his death with their outrageously lethal tasks and
suggestions.  He decided that instead, he would offer his services to the
School and hope for the best.  He spends his long hours calling for the imps
for this test.

Koranna brown furred brown-furred kankoran female woman guildmaster sguildmaster sguild~
Koranna~
A brown-furred kankoran female lingers in the shadows.
~
Koranna is brown-furred kankoran from the icy northern plains of the
Ryarl.  She is tall and lean, with pale blue eyes and prominent fangs.  As a
pup, she was blessed by her pack\@s goddess, Girikha, with remarkable speed. 
However, this talent brought her more trouble than not.  After a rash of
thefts, she was caught with the stolen prizes and was sent to live on her
own.  She eventually found her way to the School of Heroes, who offered her
refuge in exchange for work.  She now teaches young rogues the skills of the
deft hand.

Michadi Fippirea exotic young woman air scholar~
Michadi Fippirea~
An exotic young woman floats languidly within the test area.
~
The Air scholar Michadi Fippirea invited herself to the School of Heroes
fairly recently.  She has long, black hair and has an exoticism common to
children of adventuring couples.  Early in her scholarly career, she
experimented with magical flight, and found the freedom it provided a joy
beyond any other she had experienced.  She has visited many of the far
corners of Avendar (although not always intentionally), and has enjoyed the
company of such famed scholars as Zilba Gralci.  Her travels brought her to
the School, where she has remained to imbue young adventurers with her love
of flying.

Qijoch~
A shifty nefortu rogue is here, gleefully preparing the targets.
~
Qijoch is the small nefortu rogue who prepares the targets for the Test
of the Pitch.  His skin is a dark, smoky grey, and his wings flap
energetically to keep him aloft.  He was caught on School grounds trying to
pilfer various coins and trinkets by Koranna the rogue trainer.  She
initially suggested that they confiscate all of his ill-gotten gains, which
elicited an hour of high-pitched squealing for mercy.  The rest of the
School staff agreed to only take back what was theirs, and in a fit of glee,
he begged to stay.  He now works in the Hall of Trials, showing students the
quick art of the pitch.

Zebenar Kinest~
A dark-skinned man reclines on the divan, drinking a glass of wine.
~
An imposing, dark-skinned man with piercing eyes, Zebenar Kinest is the
most recent owner of the School of Heroes.  His coal-black hair is
well-groomed, matching both his opulent surroundings and the fine cut of his
clothing.  Once a famed scourge of young adventurers throughout Avendar, he
eventually realized there were safer ways to indulge in his amusements. 
Using the fortunes he had amassed through his famous exploits, he purchased
the School of Heroes for its disconcerting record of imp-related training
accidents.  He now rewards those who survive the Tower of Testing with a
small token of his esteem.

A massive platinum dragon is curled up here, fangs bared.
~
This massive platinum dragon shines in the bright light of the chamber. 
The scales are near blinding, and her powerful claws and open jaws make her
an incredibly imposing sight.  She has no apparent restraints, the cold of
its breath chills the air around her.  Long icicles have formed along her
powerful tail, cracking when she moves it ever so slightly.  Her eyes burn a
shocking, intense white, peering out into the chamber she inhabits.

Kashelle Eroq~
A bright-eyed ethron woman sits quietly within the grove.
~
Kashelle Eroq is a leaf-green ethron woman, clad in leather.  She stands
about five feet tall, and is both toned and trim.  Born in Lithling Valley,
she became comfortable with many of Avendar\@s races and the greater culture
of Earendam.  She is reputed to be a talented hunter and guide, and plumes
her arrows with a white feather.  Her travels eventually brought her into
contact with the School of Heroes, who offered her the opportunity to train
young naturalists.  She now guides new students, initiating them into the
secrets of the wild.

Issthali brown srryn female~
Issthali~
A brown srryn female stands silently on the wide stairs.
~
A brown-scaled srryn named Issthali watches the stairwell leading to the
School\@s upper floor.  She is tall and serpentine, her yellow eyes moving
abruptly whenever they sense movement.  She once lived on the far south of
the continent, living with others of her kind not far from Ashta Harrud. 
Her reasons for coming to the School are an enigma.  Many of the teachers
expected trouble from her, but she has proven a staunch and capable member
of the community.  She intervenes when fights break out, ending them with
characteristic srryn ferocity.

A magic mouth hovers in mid-air, grinning nonchalantly.

More magic than matter, this disembodied mouth is little more than a set
of rich red lips.  Its origin is a mystery of sorts, as it simply appeared
within the School during its original construction and never saw fit to
leave.  Since then, it has become something of a mascot, and delights in
idling near the School\@s exit portals.  It is said to not be bound by planar
space, and inhabits all of its favorite locations at once.

A sickly human with a shaved head meditates on a reed mat.

The pale-skinned acolyte, Palako, rests within the sanctuary.  He is thin
enough to suggest frailty, but his placid brown eyes suggest surprising
awareness.  According to School rumors, he grew up in the monastery south of
Var Bandor, where he was treated for his sickliness.  He reveals little on
the matter, but does bear the hallmarks of a disciplined and self-denying
lifestyle.  He was recommended to the School of Heroes by Kisjam the Elder,
who believed strongly in the boy\@s talent.  It is his charge to enlighten
new mentalists to the power of the mind.

Narana Innova~
A young aelin woman with brown hair parcels out weapons.
~
Narana is a young aelin woman who serves as an attendant to the School\@s
weapon desk.  A daugher of house Innova, she has come from the aelin home
city of Ilodaiya to assist the staff with the provisioning of new travelers.
Some suggest that her family ties were able to land her the well-paid but
relaxed position, but she seems unperturbed by such allegations.  Her long,
brown hair and attractive face are a welcome sight to many who pass by.

light.  You espouse freedom from hate, greed, and life\@s many cruel lusts.

serve.  You may embrace law or chaos; you may choose nature or the
impartiality of the hunt; or you may seek only the road ahead of you.

The Beginning~
Out of void, Form.
Out of emptiness, Purpose.
Out of nothingness, Being.
Out of darkness...  Light.

Greetings, mortal. Your travels through the great beyond and the Siege 
Perilous have brought your spirit to the world of Avendar.  Who can know
what twist of fate has brought you here?  A forgotten spell, a wrinkle in 
space and time, the hand of a god -- regardless, your fate lies in the here
and now of this world.  When you leave this room, you will assume your
physical form.  Be wary, as for every great hero, the path is different, and
often rent with fire and blood.  Head through the portal to the north, and
you will find yourself at the entrance to the School of Heroes, where you
will take your first steps as a mortal.  Put aside all things of the world
from whence you came, and steel your heart for the journey into Avendar.
Look carefully, and learn much -- all you learn in the School will serve you
well. Depart now, and may the gods curse you with an interesting life.

Welcome to Avendar!  You may type {WHELP{x to access our help system.

Past the wrought iron gates is a wide corridor with walls cut from solid
granite blocks, lit by mounted white globes.  The entry corridor is
surprisingly simple for such a vast and well-known establishment, as it
bears no notable ornamentation.  The School\@s foyer awaits to the north,
opening up from the corridor\@s enclosure into a vast chamber.  To the south

The walls of this chamber are covered with vividly colored murals
depicting the history of Avendar.  On a backdrop of white marble, the murals
represent the progression of the world through various ages.  Globes of

~
E
ninth~
The ninth panel shows the charge of the kankoran from the east, and the
fracturing of the human Republic.  The faces within the cities have changed,
showing a mix of all known races, rather than primarily humans or aelin. 
Magic of all kinds, divided into six spheres, has been discovered, and
their arcane potential is painted in bold colors.  Armies are smaller but
present, and the world forms a patchwork of city-states, from the sky-cities
of the aelin to the villages and walled cities of humans.  
~
E
eighth~
The eighth panel depicts the self-same portal as was constructed in the
seventh, but its black surface has turned white.  Golden-skinned creatures
pour through the gateway, bolts of light leaping from them, aloft on angelic
wings.  The terror and surprise of the shuddeni archmagi is palpable.  In an
adjoining scene, a combined army of human and ch\@taren soldiers driving the
shuddeni back beneath the earth, and a great seal being erected on top of a
distant mountain passage.  Artistic renditions of reaching, clawed hands are
suppressed beneath the seal.  

To continue, {Wexamine{x the {Wninth{x panel.
~
E
seventh~
The seventh panel is a vast winter mountainscape.  Out of a crevasse in
the ground, a mass of black-haired giants and eyeless, grey humanoids boil
up.  They march on human settlements throughout the mountains, flanked by
demonic abominations.  Blood paints the snow-capped peaks, and dark bolts
leap from the shuddeni hands to the humans they conquer.  Anguish is
apparent on every human face, while diabolic glee characterizes the legion
of shuddeni and their slaves.  They construct an unholy configuration and a
monumental portal of midnight black.  

To continue, {Wexamine{x the {Weighth{x panel.
~
E
sixth~
The sixth panel shows the aftermath of the cataclysmic battles of the
fifth.  Srryn are driven back to their swamps by humans, aelin, and mighty,
enormous humanoids who fight with them.  Human cities spring up along a
river, one built around a prominent tower, another at a fork in the river. 
The aelin cities seem to shrink into the background, with these human
settlements the focal point of the piece.  Tree-like humanoids offer tablets
to the humans, as well as a quill and parchment on one side, while a great
golden army stands on the other.  

To continue, {Wexamine{x the {Wseventh{x panel.
~
E
fifth~
The fifth panel depicts a portrait of the meeting of the lizard-like
srryn and ancient humans.  Gathering into vast, barbarous armies, sparks of
flame dot their encampments.  Iron-clad humans and rapacious srryn line the
mountain sides, battling the winged aelin swordsmen who cover the mountain
peaks.  Cities are shown aflame, and death is abundant.  The second half of
the scene shows a band of humans and aelin trudging through icy plains, the
great sleeping form of a god casting its shadow across them.  

To continue, {Wexamine{x the {Wsixth{x panel.
~
E
fourth~
The fourth panel begins with the desolation following the Sundering and
the fall of the alatharya.  They cower and struggle as the great forests
return amidst the ruins of pyramids and obelisks.  Winged humanoids rise in
the mountains, creating villages within their high peaks.  These creatures,
more and more evidently aelin, carry with them the artifacts of the
alatharya to their mountain homes.  In the final portion, a floating city
stands tall upon a floating disc.  Far below, lizard-like creatures peer up
from the marshes.  

To continue, {Wexamine{x the {Wfifth{x panel.
~
E
third~
The third panel is filled with carnage, as it depicts a catastrophe that
consumes all of Avendar.  The great pyramids of the alatharya are shattered,
and flames rain from the heavens.  Unspeakable monsters slither from beneath
the cracking earth, and winged, angelic servitors descend from the darkening
sky.  Looming overhead, three deities look over the destruction.  One takes
the shape of a mighty black dragon; one is stern, clad in iron, whose steely
gaze imparts no pity; and one gazes sadly over the destruction, clad in blue
robes.  

To continue, {Wexamine{x the {Wfourth{x panel.
~
E
second~
The second panel shows the alatharya as they ascend to the acme of their
influence.  Gargantuan pyramids dominate landscapes, and wonders abound. 
Cities float overhead, while sculptors craft marvelous statues, and scholars
call forth beings of pure magic to create cyclopean obelisks.  At first, the
alatharya are depicted as noble and determined; toward the end of the
montage, a look of avarice and smug self-affirmation steals across their
features.  Silver light bathes the top of alatharyan pyramids, their priests
looking to the sky with longing.  

To continue, {Wexamine{x the {Wthird{x panel.  
~
E
first~
The first panel of the mural portrays the creation of the world.  A
formless void is presided over by the greater powers, who shape and populate
the world of Avendar.  Prominent in the display are silver-hued giants-- the
ancient alatharya.  They are shown building the first great cities, and
fighting a series of epic battles against monsters and demons.  The last
scene depicts the first alatharya to use magic; a lone giant raising his
arms to the heavens.  Above him looms a large, black dragon.

The Hall of Fates~
The spiral stairwell rises up into a three-way junction, its cloudy glass
central column rising to the ceiling.  The stones here are older and more
rugged, suggesting that this portion of the School is older than the ground
level.  The vaulted ceiling is made from the same dark, elder stone as the
walls, with the tile floor worn from age.  From here, doors lead to the
north, east, and west.  The eastern door is made of untarnished gold which
glitters in the magical light of the chamber.  The west door is made from a
single, magically crafted slab of onyx.  To the north, a door has been

Golden light illuminates this vast chamber, filling the room with a
pleasant warmth.  There seems to be no true source to the glow, which
radiates outward from all directions.  White marble columns line a carpeted
path which terminates in a white altar, upon which an enormous book is
opened.  Near the ceiling, a carved bas relief circles the room, depicting
ancient heroes fighting the assembled hosts of darkness.  To the east, a
doorway lies on the other side of the altar, while two other open doorways
lead north and south.

The Chamber of Neutrality~
This grey marbled room is a study in muted tones.  Stone chairs form a
half-circle before a raised, central dais, the chamber illuminated by
sterile, white light.  The walls are lined with mounted sconces, separated
by the three arched, open doorways that lead to the north, east, and west. 
The air is clear but somehow close, and the tile and marble surfaces reflect
the tiniest steps into a loud clatter.  To the south is the School junction,
while three chambers await through the room\@s other exits.

The Chamber of Night~
Shadows shroud much of this large room, darkening the stone walls and
chilling the still air.  What little light permeates the chamber comes from
two glowing braziers of hot coals on either side of a central altar.  The
altar itself is of sinister design, marked with intricate carvings and
cruel, sharp edges.  Upon it lies a waxy-looking scroll, bearing ancient,
flowing script.  A roaring, hateful light swells within the northern
doorway, while those to the west and south are either muted or absent.  The
School junction lies through an onyx door to the east.

The Chamber of Purity~
A white room with grey tiles opens here, its layered stone walls rising
to a high ceiling.  A length of carpet leads from the doorway to a large
statue, one palm outstretched.  Beside that statue are two other figures;
one is posed lifting a broken manacle above his head; another bears a sword
in her delicate hand.  All three figures are crafted in a realistic style,
giving each one an almost unsettlingly lifelike cast.  The room is cool and
bright, with its only apparent exit to the west.

{WNeutral Good{x characters agree on only the furtherance of goodly

elements from their flamboyant chaotic cousins.  This allows them a maximum
freedom of motion in terms of how they achieve their ends.  They thwart evil
on many grounds, and usually without overruling or ignoring the wishes of
their friends.  A neutral good character serves as the bridge between their
lawful and chaotic allies, and as such, often feels the strain of trying to

A muscular man dressed as a scholar of Salyra stands at the right hand of
the central statue.  In one hand he bears a long, silver staff, while the
other raises a broken manacle above his head.  His expression is energetic
and sharpened with intensity.  The broken shackle and its shattered chain
bear the cruel spikes of the shuddeni, suggestive of his role as both healer

her hair to one side leaving it frozen in stone.  Her stone wings are folded

The Chamber of Truth~
The walls of this chamber are enchanted with Air magic, replacing them
with the sweeping illusion of a disorientingly realistic skyscape.  A
pitch-perfect simulacrum of the sun shines overhead, and the mist of
cloudstuff passes languidly through its bright light.  The floor of the
School takes on the effect of a thin path of hovering stones, which lead to
a huge, floating mirror.  Lined in silver, the reflection it reveals is the
room as it truly is: a circular room of stone and tile.  A doorway to the

They tend to view laws or rules-- even benign ones-- with suspicion, if not
outright disbelief.  To them, such restrictions provide possible refuge to
evil; without them, evil has no foothold to cling to.  Characters of this
alignment are zealous, pursuing whatever they do with an unpredictable
dynamism.  A chaotic good character struggles against many, even his allies,
because his actions so routinely ignore common wisdom or convention.

The Chamber of Many Waters~
The centerpiece of this room is an enormous crystal fountain, from which
streams of water flow into a series of translucent basins.  The basins are
arranged around a center pool, which ripples of its own accord.  The water
itself is scented, giving the chamber\@s expanse a breath of mild perfume. 
The squared walls of the chamber are mirrored, creating an endless
multiplicity of cubes, reflecting the fountain into a dizzying array of
repetitions.  The polished white tile of the floor only enhances the endless
effect, its surface ringing with each step upon it.  To the north lies the
Chamber of Light.

{WLawful Good{x characters believe strongly in both order and goodness. 
Organization is one of their strengths, and they often see themselves as
leaders among their allies.  They frequently appreciate military structure
and tend to be the most rigid of their alignmental brethren.  A lawful good
character believes that evil can only be truly defeated by constructing
systems to keep it isolated and contained.  They are often hounded by their
chaotic allies for their lack of flexibility, as their many oaths limit
their freedom of action.

The Chamber of Law~
This chamber appears to be the interior of an enlongated pentagonal
cupola.  The central pentagon serves as the ceiling, and is a perfectly
shaped skylight, lighting the interior during the day and reflecting
interior light at night.  The floor and walls are tiled with a vast array of
geometric and fractal forms, creating both large patterns and tiny
intricacies.  At the floor\@s center is a pedestal, upon which sits a
mathematically-perfect crystal crown.  To the west lies muted greys of the
Chamber of Neutrality.

{WLawful Neutral{x characters tend to view order as the fundamental that
guides the multiverse.  They are often organizers, and frequently appreciate
law in all of its forms.  They are always methodical in their actions and
believe that for each step there is an appropriate sequence.  They usually
adhere to city law, but this is not demanded simply by virtue of choosing
this alignment.  They are most often in conflict with those who dwell in
chaos, but should be mindful that their neutrality will be challenged
equally often.

The Chamber of Balance~
The decor of this room is done in rich browns, with glossy hardwood
flooring and complementary cut stone walls.  Furniture is arrayed about the
chamber, all of it equidistant from one another.  The chamber is lit by
globes of nested light, which line the walls\@ ends and the base of the
nested ceiling.  The ceiling is made from beautifully painted tiles, which
depict many aspects of mortal life in a bold panorama: birth, death, wealth,
poverty, murder, and charity.  Set against the northern wall is a set of
pure platinum scales.  The chamber\@s only exit is a doorway to the south.

{WTrue Neutral{x characters are not given to any particular bias.  They
are unconcerned with morality, and disregard order as much as they embrace
it.  Some believe they have a higher duty to the greater balance of the
multiverse; but just as many do not.  Mercenary behaviors and fair-weather
friendship are all hallmarks of the true neutral.  Because their beliefs,
motives, and notions are so diverse, they can be found in any and all
company.  Their greatest challenge is in remaining independent, when
confronted by their many associates.

The Chamber of Chaos~
There are no walls, floor, or ceiling in this tumultuous energy vortex. 
The air itself swirls rapidly about, making the space within akin to the eye
of a tornado.  The air is heavy with the charge of magic, with arcs of
energy leaping across the empty stormy air.  Scents ranging from pleasant to
grotesque follow the buffeting winds and crackles of light and sound.  At
the center of the maelstrom is a floating, reflective orb.  The dizzying
appearance of great height makes staying aloft seem dangerously unstable.

own whims to a fault, and refuse to be constrained by the laws, morality, or
overarching notions of others.  They can be friendly or fierce, joining
great heroes or villains if it suits them.  To a character of this
alignment, their personal autonomy always trumps the interests of those they
travel with.  They are unafraid of conflict or struggle, because their wild
natures are routinely challenged by moralists and lawmakers alike.

This circular room is topped by a hemispherical ceiling, giving the
impression of being beneath a great dome.  Near the center of the room, set
into a deep depression, is a pit of burning coals.  Seemingly burning of its
own accord, an enormous flame leaps nearly to the ceiling, illuminating the
entire room with its searing glow.  Lit in the hot, red light are carvings
which follow the room\@s circumference.  Chiselled into the marble surface of
the wall, the carvings depict every manner of torment, blasphemy, and
abomination.  The figures pictured appear anything but remorseful; they are
exultant.  The exit to this chamber lies south, where cooler air

for all manners of order.  They are violent, unpredictable, and savage, and
often believe the only truth is that the strong rule the weak.  They
emphasize their own dark form of individualism, willing to commit any
atrocity so long as it pleases them.  Chaotic evil characters are especially
dangerous to those who seek to control or manipulate them, as they lack
compunction and fear.  Their greatest threats are the unlikely alliances
that will form to end their reign of terror.

This vaulted chamber serves as a small temple.  Tall, black columns
support the barrel-arched ceiling, and crushed red velvet carpet covers the
ample floor.  The dark stone walls are hung with rich, red curtains, giving
the temple an opulence rarely equaled within the School\@s walls.  A black
altar is low to the floor on the west side of the room, with an enormous
statue of a dragon looming over it.  Its carved, leering face sports a
myriad of vicious fangs, and its claws clutch the altar\@s sides.  Torches
mounted upon the chamber\@s columns cast eerie flickers throughout the room,
adding to the air of menace already present within.  The temple\@s exit lies

are concerned only with themselves, and are motivated to vigorously pursue
their own self-interest.  Any tool, method, or idea is available to them, be
it lies, violence, betrayal, or cruelty.  Any morality they may have is
always contorted to support this relentless focus on what they personally
want.  They tend to be glib but sociopathic, making all friends, allies, or
lovers a matter of convenience.  Their greatest stumbling block is their own
self-focus, which can blind them to situational realities.

The Chamber of the Void~
The familiar stone and tile of the School of Heroes vanishes here,
instead replaced by a plane of utter blackness.  Less a chamber than a
lightless void, there is little indication of the chamber\@s actual size. 
Instead, it seems both impossibly vast and shudderingly oppressive.  The air
within this pocket of nothingness is clammy and clinging, as if to clutch at
whatever life might enter it.  The further one moves into this room, the
more oppressive it becomes, offering the only true measure of distance.  To

attempting to utilize their powers as well as their own.  Lawful evil

The Hall of Arms is named so because it is intended to introduce all
young adventurers to the tools of their trade: weapons and armor.  The
entrance to the Hall is patterned differently than the foyer to the west;
instead of marble columns, it has gilded plating which covers the ceiling
above.  The floor is patterned with polished tile, although instead of
depicting the sigil of the School itself, it is a stylized sword and shield.
The scent of heated copper and smoke is dimply present in the room,
suggesting a forge within a reasonable proximity.  The Hall branches out to

floor is made of thick, smooth stones rather than glossy tiles, many of
which are marked with runes of Water to dampen the forge\@s intense heat. 
Off to one side, a large anvil is surrounded by various blacksmithing tools.

The forge can repair weapons that have been damaged from use.  To

If it looks worn or damaged, it may be time to get it fixed.  Weapons which
are damaged deal less damage, and if used long enough, will eventually
break.  

Repairing weapons, however, costs money.  As a general rule, the more
powerful the weapon, the more it will cost to be repaired.  As well, the
more damaged a weapon is, the more costly it will be to have it worked on. 
To determine how much it will cost to fix your weapon, use {Westimate
<weapon keyword>{x.  Make sure to {Wremove{x your weapon first!  

If you can afford the repairs, you can get your weapon fixed with {Wrepair
<weapon keyword>{x.  This will return its condition to perfect and it will
again be at its full power.  Sometimes it is cheaper to just buy another
weapon than repair the one you have, so always keep that in mind.

The southern display case shows a canoe, a firekit, a glowing pendant,
and a roll of maps.  

A canoe is used to cross water.  Characters who do not {Wfly{x should carry
a canoe with them at all times while traveling, to avoid being halted by a
river or separated from their groups.  

A firekit can be used to make a campfire.  Like the bedroll, it can increase
the regeneration rate of {Whit points{x and {Wmana{x.  You can gain its
benefits by using {Wrest campfire{x or {Wsleep campfire{x.  

The glowing pendant gives off white light.  When traveling in caves or at
night, most characters will need a light source to be able to see.  Any item
which glows will provide this benefit, and a character only needs to wear
one.  

The map pack contains a variety of basic maps, including a map of Avendar, a
map of Var Bandor, a map of Krilin, and two maps for northern and southern
Earendam.  These maps can help you find your way if you get lost in these
cities, or generally show how the world is laid out.  
~
E
north~
The northern display case shows a sample ration cake, a sample jug, a
packet of travel wafers, a small hide pack, and a bedroll.  

A ration cake serves as food.  As you adventure, you will grow hungry and
need to {Weat{x.  The cake is a basic example of food, but there will be
great variety of other foods to try of varying quality.  

An earthen jug is a drink container.  During your travels, you will grow
thirsty and need water.  This jug will hold water for you to {Wdrink{x when
there is no {Wfountain{x (such as in Center Square).  

The packet of wafers contains travel wafers.  When you open it, you can take
the wafers out and eat them like you would a {Wpill{x.  Each wafer will
restore {Wmovement{x points, allowing you to continue walking rather than be
forced to {Wrest{x or {Wsleep{x.  

A small hide pack is a container.  This means it is an item which stores
other items.  You can {Wput{x multiple other items in a container, and
{Wget{x them out later when you need them.  To look to see what is in a
container, use {Wexamine <container keyword>{x.  

A bedroll can be rested on or slept on.  Doing so will increase the
regeneration rate of your {Whit points{x and {Wmana{x.  You can do so by
typing {Wrest bedroll{x or {Wsleep bedroll{x.

The Beginning of the Hall of Professions~
The Hall of Professions is the part of the School of Heroes dedicated to
the training of adventurers in their respective guilds.  Since many of the
skills taught here are rudimentary, many of Avendar\@s individual guilds are
not represented; instead, a broader professional trainer serves each
respective classification.  The floor and walls are made from granite,
giving the hallway itself a cool, clean feel.  To the east is a fighting pit
where young warriors train, while to the west, a well-supplied classroom
lends itself to the instruction of rudimentary scholars.  The Hall of

The Hall of Professions~
The Hall of Professions serves all young adventurers, supplying them with
access to the basic skills of their trades.  Each classroom provides
information for beginners on what to expect from the guild, and where their
power will one day lie.  The floor and walls are made from granite, lending
a cool, clean feel to the hall itself.  To the east lies a shadowy alcove
where young rogues can find instruction, while to the west a training room
serves starting templars.  The Hall of Professions continues to the north
and south.

The End of the Hall of Professions~
The Hall of Professions come to an end here, with the last of its
trainers.  This wing of the School of Heroes is dedicated to training in
basic skills and themes, so young adventurers know what to expect from their
future.  Broad, professional trainers serve the School in this function,
offering information and help to students of various guilds.  To the east, a
wild grove grows of its own accord to assist young naturalists.  To the
west, a small sanctuary serves young mentalists in their future endeavors. 
To the south, the Hall of Professions continues.

This classroom is laid out for the instruction of young scholars,
including a number of large tables.  Simple and bright, the chamber is set
with unpolished stones and lit by white globes, mounted on brackets along
the walls.  On the northern wall is a large chalk board, marked with various
notes on runic markings for scrolls.  Arranged about the room are examples
of magical devices, such as wands and staves, in addition to instructions

The Fighting Pit~
Three steps descend from the hallway into this chamber, which serves as a
training area for aspiring young warriors.  The floor is padded, marked with
spots of blood and sweat from those who have practiced here in the past.  A
myriad of weapons line the walls, representing all of the martial creeds of
Avendar\@s battle guilds.  The room is lit by simple iron-mounted lights,
bright enough to ease instruction and demonstration.  The air here is heavy
with the scents of exertion, stinging the noses of those who enter it.  To

The floor is heavily padded to allow instruction in dodges, knockdowns,

replaced, bears the tell-tale spot-stains of blood and sweat.  Warriors are
often at the front of a combat situation, avoiding or fending off the blows
of his, or his group\@s, foes.  As a result, warriors often quickly grow
accustomed to the pain of battle and learn to avoid it.

The walls of the fighting pit have mountings for every shape of weapon

flails, maces, polearms, spears, swords, staves, and whips.  Those present
in this chamber are used for training purposes, and thus not suited to
actual combat.  Warriors many weapons or few, but they are always their

A Shadowy Alcove~
This alcove is steeped in shadows, allowing much of the room to be
shrouded by a veil of darkness.  The room\@s floor is smooth and silent, worn
by many feet and even more motion.  The high walls curve upward to a pointed
ceiling with much of the light entering through the doorway to the western

The rogue\@s best friend are the shadows, in which he can find concealment
to hide and to strike.  Rogues often make use of the {Whide{x skill,
vanishing into the shadows suddenly and completely.  When unseen, a rogue
can strike with even more deadly efficiency.  A rogue is always most wary of
other rogues, who are not fooled by such simple tricks.

The floor here is smooth from motion, and allows a rogue\@s graceful,
silent step.  A rogue can {Wsneak{x, allowing him to move silently over most
terrain if he is wearing appropriate footwear.  It conceals many of his
actions, and allows him to remain hidden even when moving.

walls wall pointed ceiling~
The walls of the room slope upward to a pointed ceiling, but bear no
lighting fixtures.  Instead, the room is lit from the hallway.  Rogues can
see in mundane darkness, as they are trained to use {Wnight vision{x.  When
a rogue wears nothing that glows, he can gain additional concealment from
those seeking to find him.  Again, the darkness plays to the rogue\@s
advantage.

This large room is divided into two major sections: the first is a
fighting area, while the second is a series of tables and a chalk board. 
The combat area is lined with a myriad of common weapons, and covers the
basic instruction of fighting technique.  The chalk board and tables cover
the rudiments of arcane magic; the board outlines basic defensive spells and
the methods of weapon branding and conjuration.  The various tables give
students a place, if they wish it, to sit and read about their early powers
and methods.  There is no desk for the instructor, but rather much open
space for them to move back and forth between study and practical

This small room is reminiscent of a monastic cell.  It is simply
furnished, with white-paneled wood covering the stone walls.  A few simple
paintings hang from them, one of them depicting four flowers; another a
prismatic snowflake; and another showing a stylized dove.  The floor is
covered by reed mats, darkened with dye.  A low table sits at room\@s center,

A small but curious grove grows within the School of Heroes, complete
with perception-defying trees and small animals.  The chamber itself has
given way to a great canopy above, which serves as a makeshift ceiling.  The
great shadow of the limbs above gives the room a dank, earthy feel, with
luminescent moss bathing the area in a blue glow.  The clatter of animals
and birds within the branches very much makes this place feel like a
fragment of the deepest wild.  A doorway to the west leads back into the

The Test of Water~
The Test of Water is housed in a particularly dank stone chamber.  Water
drips steadily from the ceiling, and a great pool has accumulated below. 
The floor here approaches the pool before giving way, a glowing orb at the
bottom illuminating its murky depths.  The stone walls lean inward, and
stubborn moss clings to the corners of the bricks.  A mounted globe of light
illuminates the chamber, which would otherwise be too wet for a lantern. 
The bottom of the pool is downward, while the Hall of Trials lies to the
east.  

A sign, marked with water stains, waits to be read.

sign~
Sometimes you will encounter water which would be otherwise block your
travels.  To travel underwater, you need to be affected by {Wwater
breathing{x or have the {Wswim{x skill.  Water breathing will allow you to
remain underwater until its duration expires; swim will not.  

When underwater, you need to be careful that you don\@t drown.  If the
appropriate spells expire, you will start to drown and it will be difficult
for you to escape.  To tell how long the duration of a spell is, use
{Waffects{x.  This will show you how much longer you can be underwater
before the trouble begins.  

Remember also that you will fight less effectively underwater, and
{Wlightning{x damage is increased while there.

The Test of Darkness~
The Test of Darkness is intended to teach young adventurers about the
oft-necessity of light sources.  Like much of the Hall of Trials, this short
side corridor is made from aging, rough-hewn stone and lit by hanging
lanterns.  The floor is not as smooth here as it is in other places, with
some dust and pebbles having accumulated on the floor\@s surface.  The air
here is heavy with the same musty scent as elsewhere in the Hall, and only
grows stronger to the east.  The lantern light goes out in the eastern part
of the corridor, while to the west the Hall of Trials awaits.

The room to the east of you is {Wdark{x.  Without a light source, you
won\@t be able to see anything at all without the {Wnight vision{x skill or
{Winfravision{x spell.  When outdoors at night, almost all rooms will be
similarly dark, making these skills quite valuable.  

However, for those classes which do not receive those skills or spells, you
can still light your way using a glowing item.  When worn, an item that
glows will illuminate the room you are in, allowing you to see normally. 
The School of Heroes sells an item like this in the White Satchel: {Wa brass

The floor is covered with a variety of junk: old books, debris, broken wood,
long-forgotten barrels, and assorted glassware.  There are few places in the

The Hall of Trials is intended to help students of the School of Heroes
to learn how to overcome basic obstacles and use universal techniques.  This
includes physical barriers, environmental conditions, and abilities

The pious give offerings to the gods in the hope of their favor.  To do
this, use the {Wsacrifice{x command.  This allows you to make an offering of
an item to the god of your choosing.  The power of the item you offer and
how much you have offered will affect the chances that you will be rewarded
for your action.  The reward will come in the form of a temporary bonus
based on the deity to which you sacrifice.

The Hall of Trials~
The Hall of Trials is intended to help students of the School of Heroes
to learn how to overcome basic obstacles and use universal techniques.  This
includes physical barriers, environmental conditions, and abilities
available to all adventurers.  The Hall is incredibly old, built of
rough-hewn blocks that have the musty scent of age.  The floor has been worn
smooth by generations of young adventurers walking upon it, but is generally
swept clean of debris.  At regular intervals along the ceiling are oil
lanterns, which cast shadows throughout.  To the west, a damp chamber awaits
through a wide doorway.

The Test of the Pitch~
An open but somehow cramped room, this side-space is filled with a
variety of training dummies.  Various reed or straw or wooden figures sit,
stand, or lay toppled throughout the stone interior.  The high, curving
ceiling and uneven walls give the collection of pseudo-bodies a surprisingly
unnerving air, with a few of them set up in a row toward the center of the
room.  Hanging lanterns light the room, its shadowy light providing enough
illumination to see but also enough to veil the room\@s figures just so. 
Splashes of fluid stain a number of the statues and the floor.  The Hall of

The Hall of Trials comes to an end here, not far north of the doorway
leading to its final test.  The rough-hewn stone of the Hall ascends, and a
set of wide, well-tread stairs lead upward in sets of two.  Moving both
north and up, the musty, basement air slowly clears, and the flickering
ceiling lanterns slowly come to a stop.  A central handrail follows the
center of the ascending stairs, and warmth and light glow from the archway
that represents the Hall\@s end point.  The Hall of Trials continues to the

{WCh\@taren: Section 5{x

Ch\@taren appear as translucent, golden-skinned humanoids.  Their most common
hair color is silver, and their eyes are often a vivid and unearthly shade. 
They are not fully present upon the Prime, making their physical sensations,
including injury, less pronounced.  As a people, they are a generally
carefree lot, untroubled by most affairs.  

With the collapse of their original culture, the ch\@taren often adapt with
relative ease to the governments or cultures of those around them. 
Ch\@taren, as a general rule, do not lead wholly settled lives, taking up an
adventurous mindset for at least some portion of their youth.  They excel at
magic, but often struggle when the rigor of discipline becomes too great.  
~
E
chtsec4~
{WCh\@taren: Section 4{x

In the lead up to the modern era, the ch\@taren integrated themselves into
the societies of the Prime.  Their unusual looks and immense beauty made
them popular, and this was only cemented by their reputation for goodliness,
valor, and zeal.  Yet, ch\@taren could never fully become a part of these
other societies, and mostly focused upon their havens.  

With the rise of the shuddeni Scourge, and a new blindness-inducing disease
known as the Eyeblight, the ch\@taren have sealed off their two remaining
havens.  As the Scourge ravaged many strongholds of Spirit magic and the
city-states of the Prime, the ch\@taren again found themselves mobilized to
action.  

Over a number of generations, the last of the Scourge\@s strongholds were
routed.  The ch\@taren goddesses, Rystaia and Calaera, supported those who
battled the shuddeni, which has only deepened the anger between the two
races.  However, once again, the ch\@taren are respected throughout the world
as liberators and combatants of the highest order.  
~
E
chtsec3~
{WCh\@taren: Section 3{x

The Republic of Earendam granted a number of parcels of land to the ch\@taren
in the wake of the War.  These three locations became known as the ch\@taren
havens.  To the far north, was Avayn, the haven of Ice.  To the south, was
Ad\@masteisa, haven of Wind.  And on the isle of Alensha, was Jh\@ten, the
haven of Waves.  

As the human Republic fractured, the shuddeni made one last desperate move
against their ch\@taren foes.  Mobilized by the rising god, Arkhural, the
remnants of the shuddeni war machine struck at Ad\@masteisa, and destroyed
it.  The great hero of the War of Night, Chalane Tyra, died a martyr in
defense of the haven of Wind.  

After the atrocity, the famed ch\@taren heroine, Calaera, led her vengeful
warband in pursuit of the shuddeni butchers.  The warband offered no mercy,
and swiftly put the shuddeni to the sword.  This victory only exposed the
frailty of the havens thus, in its wake, Calaera saw to the construction of
Sy\@ceera, which would ward off future attacks.  
~

{WCh\@taren: Section 2{x

The Dragon devoured many of the outer planes which were unprotected by the
Avendarian Compact, and one of them was the home of the ch\@taren and their
twin gods.  Their hope of survival was virtually non-existent when faced
with the terrible might of the Overgod, and it seemed only a matter of time
until the Dragon\@s victory.  

Rystaia and Her high priest, Shathalith, uncovered the plans of the shuddeni
to create a great nexus to the void.  While they prepared for the passage of
the ch\@taren to the Prime, Vaialos valiantly faced Tzet-Askhari.  His power
was nothing compared to the dread might of the Dragon, and He was devoured,
along with the ch\@taren home world.  

However, with the gateway open, the ch\@taren poured through the portal,
arriving suddenly in wartorn Avendar.  This sudden reversal of fortune put
the near-victorious shuddeni on the defensive, and would be remembered for
all time as the Day of Two Dawns.  Quickly, the tide of the War of Night
turned in favor of the surface races, and the shuddeni were driven into the
earth.

{WAelin: Section 1{x

The aelin are one of Avendar\@s oldest sapient races, said to have risen
shortly after the Sundering.  They are avian bipeds, gifted with the ability
to fly.  Their wit and charm are both keen, and they are blessed with great
speed.  They are known for being the first race to come into its own
following the fall of the alatharya.  

From the beginning, the aelin were biased toward civilization, seeking order
and creation following the madness of the Sundering.  Nurtured by their
deific parents, Aeolis and Alia, their growing society reflected the desire
for order and the predilections of their avian nature.  They built great
cities in the mountains from which they rose, the greatest of which was
Ilodaiya, built upon a vast floating disc.  

Their existence was prosperous, and in time, they discovered the existence
of Iandir, whose laws they in turn embraced.  They were also insular,
shunning the lowlands and valleys and their primitive inhabitants.  This
distance would prove ultimately detrimental when they aelin became embroiled
in the War of Fire, the first great conflict of Avendar after the Sundering.

{WAlatharya: Section 1{x

The alatharya are reputed to be the oldest of Avendar\@s sapient races, and
their history stretches back to the dawn of mortal life.  According to
legend, the alatharya were once the chosen people of the gods, gifted with
both phenomenal strength and formidable intellect.  Using these gifts, the
alatharya spread throughout the world, creating a civilization of mythic
proportions.  

How long the alatharya remained the masters of Avendar is unknown, but the
magnificence of their creations has lingered into the present.  Ruins of
their ancient empires are still found in remote regions of the world,
monuments that have withstood the elements for millennia.  

However, the alatharya were not destined to remain the lords of the Prime. 
Using the magic that the gods had bestowed upon them, the alatharya grew
mighty in both the knowledge of Avendar and the study of the planes. 
Unsatisfied with the limits placed upon them, the alatharya dreamt of
conquering all of the multiverse.  
~
E
alathsec2~
{WAlatharya: Section 2{x

Delving into the powers that upheld the Prime Material, the alatharya began
to tap the quintessence, the source for both magic and the planes.  When the
alatharya attempted to use their newfound powers against the gods, they
discovered the true depths of their folly.  

The mighty Dragon, Tzet-Askhari, warned Its fellow creators of the hubris of
the First Race, and the gods turned the schemes of the alatharya against
them.  Great was the vengeance of the gods, and greater still the punishment
the alatharya bore.  Legends say that in less than a year, the vast
civilization of the alatharya had fallen.  

Yet, the wrath of the gods went further than simple destruction.  The power
of magic was divided into elemental spheres, in an event now known as the
Sundering.  Magic scoured the surface of Avendar in the form of torrential,
earth-shattering storms.  Holy and unholy creatures were freed from bondage,
destroying everything the alatharya had made.

Virtually ignored by the aelin, other races rose in the lowlands.  The
aelin, who had developed the rudiments of the forge from knowledge gleaned
from the fallen alatharya, lingered in a lengthy bronze age.  They are
credited as the first to develop swordsmanship, and the roots of the
ak\@anginta stem directly from this idyllic period.  

Meanwhile, the reptilian srryn and the wingless humans allied to plunder the
riches of the aelin culture.  Against these two opposed races, the aelin
faced their greatest threat: stronger, better armed, and magically adept
invaders.  The aelin were unable to stop these invaders at first, and many
of their cities were toppled with little meaningful resistance.  

The aelin marshalled the resources of their people, including the wisdom of
their own civilization, as well as the artifacts and relics of the fallen
alatharya.  Even with these, defense against the invaders was difficult.  A
great aelin hero named Marlax stood first among the race\@s swordmasters, and
led many charges into rival forces.  Time, for the aelin, was running out.  
~
E
aelinsec3~
{WAelin: Section 3{x

It was not until a renegade group of humans allied with the aelin that the
tide of war turned.  Together, they sought the Father of the Seas, Jolinn,
and His return brought with it the magics of Water.  With the aid of the
Titans, the War of Fire was ended, and the mauled aelin civilization
survived into a new age.  

The aelin assisted the humans in forging a new empire of their own, which
mirrored the unique form of aelin government.  This civilization became
known as the Republic of Earendam.  However, the aelin never fully
integrated with this rapidly expanding empire, and eventually withdrew,
returning to the insular nature it had fostered before the War of Fire.  

During this time, the Father of the Seas sent a servitor deity to help
restore the aelin.  This demigod was called Serachel, and would herald great
change for the embattled race.  As humans sought greater territory within
Dantaron river valley, the aelin, as a race, sought to discover what, if
anything, separated them from the races they had scorned.  
~
E
aelinsec4~
{WAelin: Section 4{x

Serachel donned mortal flesh and walked among the people He was to save. 
His intellect was shockingly vast, and paired with His immense beauty, He
quickly was accepted into the inner circles of Ilodaiya\@s highest offices. 
Alia, the mother of the aelin, beseeched Aeolis to come with Her, to also
walk among their children.  He refused, remaining aloof, but He did not stop
Her from doing as She pleased.  

Serachel and Alia shared immense prestige, and the pair encouraged a new
breed of aelin thought.  The idealism of the Aeolian era dwindled, and aelin
women found new freedom and social position.  In time Serachel would become
aware of the magics of the shuddeni.  He urged the aelin to embrace and
master the Void; this, He said, would prevent another monumental defeat such
as that of the War of Fire.  

There seemed nothing left to chance.  Alia\@s growing debauchery and
Serachel\@s terrifying grip on the aelin destiny suggested a great
transformation was taking place.  Many of the Aeolian warriors left to aid
the human empires as the War of Night continued, leaving Serachel and Alia
to command the race as a whole from Ilodaiya.  
~
E
aelinsec5~
{WAelin: Section 5{x

The coming of the ch\@taren disrupted the perfect plans of Serachel, and
their mighty goddess, Rystaia Lightbringer, exposed His dark designs.  She
imprisoned Him in His nightmare realm for millennia, while Aeolis drew His
love, Alia, back to the realm of the gods.  However, Her time as a mortal
had irrevocably transformed Her into the Mad Angel, Alil.  

The blow to the aelin pride was staggering, and even with the defeat of
Serachel, the race stagnated.  They often avoid interference with other
races when possible, and live primarily in the regions surrounding their
racial home of Ilodaiya, across the Sea of Lidreau.  In the ages since, the
aelin have struggled to come to terms with the events surrounding the War of
Night, and their implications for the aelin soul.  

Aelin typically take great stock in their bloodline and their appearance. 
Their most striking feature, of course, is their wings, which are both large
and feathered.  What aelin do dwell among humans typically occupy positions
of authority, or at least influence and wealth.  Their natural grace and
keen wit make them well suited to cults of personality.

ethsec1~
{WEthron: Section 1{x

The ethron arose during the age following the Sundering.  According to
legend, they were born from the earth and grass, and their early form was
less animal than plant, and less humanoid than golemic.  These young
sapients attracted the attention of a new goddess, who appeared to them in
their forest home.  She shaped and guided them, transforming them into
creatures beautiful, wise, and strong.  She brought to them language, and
they named Her Elar, All-Mother.  

The srryn warlords had not yet risen in their mires, and magic still
remained a difficult and unruly series of forces.  Elar nurtured in Her
children a spark of this magic, which had infused all life on the Prime. 
She imbued an ancient tree, in whose shade She had found the first ethron,
with Her divine power.  She called this tree Firiel, the Tree of Life, and
bound all of Avendar\@s forests far and near to it.  With this blessing, the
ethron were free to travel without fear.  

The earliest known contact with the ethron occurred in the Dantaron river
valley, with the Earendamian hero known as Truna.  He was considered a great
hunter, and is reputed to have traveled further and longer than any. 
According to ethron legend, he followed the white arrow of the ethron
goddess, Nariel, and discovered the settlement in western Lithling Valley. 
He made peace with them, taking an ethron wife, and fostered ties before the
trials of the War of Fire.  
~
E
ethsec2~
{WEthron: Section 2{x

Firiel\@s power allowed the ethron to avoid much of the destruction of the
War of Fire however, their beloved forests were not so fortunate.  The
wastelands created by the rampaging srryn and human warlords left them with
few places in the region to go.  The human and aelin empires, recognizing
the ethron affinity for nature, sought them out to restore the great
forests.  Eqiril, a powerful druid, spent many lifetimes renewing the fallen
kingdom of Caal, transforming it into the great forest of Qilarn.  

The need to restore led the ethron to the far corners of Avendar, where they
were largely responsible for renewing the earth back to fertility.  As the
human empire of Earendam grew to encompass more and more territory, the
ethron, almost by necessity, had to fortify their position within Qilarn. 
They arranged into clans, headed by a powerful chief who directed them. 
This would serve them well during the War of Night.  

The ethron ranger-king, Ilciryas, was both cunning and well-informed.  His
trackers made him plainly aware of the advances of the shuddeni legions, and
with this knowledge, he united the many ethron clans of Morn, Qilarn, and
elsewhere.  He assembled a great host within the forest, and his archers and
druids prepared for battle.  When the shuddeni arrived, they were besieged
by invisible foes, hails of arrows, and attacking plants.  Their forces
decimated, what few shuddeni survived staggered out of the forest, never to
return.

{WNefortu: Section 1{x

The nefortu rose in Avendar\@s far south, southeast of the human city of
Ashta Harrud.  According to nefortean shaman, the race lived in a great
canyon that was plentiful in food, shade, and heat.  The race venerated
their first deity, Tzajai, and it was there that they developed their
characteristic love for games, entertainment, and frivolity.  

This changed with the coming of Bayyal, whose fiery magic both terrified and
amazed them.  Although many died to the fury of this new god, many more
embraced his furious bent and the explosive powers of Fire.  This marks an
interesting contrast to the rise of Fire elsewhere, with the srryn, and
suggests a measure of fate, rather than chance, in being discovered twice in
two different places.  

Bayyal led the flame-mad nefortu north, out of their idyllic canyon, and
joined the War of Fire by torching the prosperous southern human
civilization of Ashta Harrud.  The feverish destruction laid waste to the
fertile lands, and the fury of Bayyal transformed the grasslands into the
vast, permanent scar known as the Crimson Sands.  With His imprisonment by
Jolinn, many nefortu sought new homes in post-War Avendar.  
~
E
nefsec2~
{WNefortu: Section 2{x

The nefortu settled into a canyon just north of the Crimson Sands, which
they called Kzaya-Ha, while others of their kind continued north by night. 
They found their way to a sea-cave, which they called Rahh-Nefor, and in the
process, discovered their great affinity for commerce.  They lauded a

humanity via Var Bandor.  

During the War of Night, the shuddeni employed the nefortu as assassins and
thieves, seeking to use them against the allied forces they fought.  The
nefortu did so only for profit, and with the victory of the light, turned on
their former shuddeni allies.  They gained a measure of respect from other
races in hunting and driving out shuddeni in nearby caverns-- also for
profit.  Their trade ties only increased.  

The nefortu, however, never created unified kingdoms or empires like those
of the humans or aelin.  Nefortu are given to a playful, trick-oriented
nature, and their exceptional greed and craftiness is respected among their
own far more than it is tolerated by others.  Thus, nefortean societies
remain rudimentary, and are unlikely to ever produce lasting political
structures.

Nefortu embrace the idea of chance, and pursue fortunes by all manner of
trickery.  They are considered the inventors of the business contract, as
well as the creators of modern gambling.  They also possess a strong
affinity for magic, making them some of the most formidable practitioners of
Fire magic out of all races.  

Physically, nefortu are the smallest race, averaging between three and four
feet in height.  Their bodies are nimble but tough, and they are gifted with
the ability to fly on leathery wings.  Their faces are often bat-like and
their bodies hairless.  They prefer caves or dark places to live, but some
have integrated themselves into mainstream society under the auspices of

{WKankoran: Section 1{x

The kankoran are a fierce and primal people, descended from the ancient
wolves that flourished before the Sundering.  Near the average human height,
kankoran appear as heavily furred wolf-men, complete with savage jaws and
lupine demeanor.  Strong and hearty, they are relentless hunters and skilled
in many creeds.  Notably, they do not have tails, giving them an extra
degree of separation from their ancestors.  

Kankoran appear in the annals of the early aelin explorers.  At that time,
they served as little more than a curiosity, living out their timeless lives
in the frozen northland they call the Ryarl.  The kankoran do not figure
prominently into any history until the rise of the human Republic of
Earendam, when human expansion brought them to the Ryarl\@s doorstep.  

Fearing for the loss of their ancestral homeland, the kankoran rallied to a
shaman by the name of Girikha.  She possessed some affinity for the wind,
and led a guerilla resistance against what they saw as human invasion.  With
time, they drove the humans back into the Brintors and claimed the Ryarl for
themselves.  Girikha led them until she grew old; legends say that she
ascended Mount Khorak and vanished from its peak.  
~
E
kanksec2~
{WKankoran: Section 2{x

The kankoran race, however, spread south over time, crossing the Brintors
themselves.  They spread through the wilds, but were driven out by the
humans and their growing empire.  Some of them were pushed east, into the
Rirro Jagka, where they came into contact with the monastic caladaran of
Jalassa.  Their warlike nature allowed them to establish themselves, and the
caladaran had little choice but to leave.  

Others were pushed to the far south, toward the great desert known as the
Crimson Sands.  Here, the kankoran adapted to the tremendous heat, and did
most of their hunting in the chill of night.  They established a new pack,
venerating a god they called Arikanja, who could survive the unforgiving
heat of the burning sun.  

The kankoran of the Ryarl would again distinguish themselves with the coming
of the War of Night.  The great hero of their pack, Rakinal, caught wind of
the Trap of Valandas, and he led his warriors to the Valandian Gap.  Their
sudden appearance saved the Army of the Golden Hand from utter annihilation,
and affirmed the might of kankoran war-tribes.  
~
E
kanksec3~
{WKankoran: Section 3{x

However, peace between the Republic and the kankoran was not to last.  In
the Rirro Jagka, a powerful clan of red-furred kankoran rose to prominence,
led by a mighty warlord who called himself Khanval.  He led them in a series
of long and protracted raids along the Republic\@s borderlands, slaughtering,
looting, and pillaging each time.  

As victory mounted upon victory, the crumbling Republic saw less and less
faith in its senate.  Khanval\@s once-small band was now a rampaging horde,
gaining momentum with every kill on its death march to the city walls.  In
one of Earendam\@s darkest moments, the senators fled for their lives rather
than face what they thought was imminent death.  

Corvandil Novis, a templar and nobleman, stepped forward to lead the city\@s
resistance.  Since his leadership was seen as having saved the city, a new
government was ushered in, and such saw the instatement of the office of the
Patrician.  The defeated kankoran bands scattered, some traveling to the
Ryarl, while others returned to their lands in the Rirro Jagka.  
~
E
kanksec4~
{WKankoran: Section 4{x

Kankoran society is chiefly structured around packs of nomadic tribes,
usually headed by the most powerful member.  This is most often a male, but
as in the case of Girikha, has also included females.  In times of crisis,
smaller packs tend to band together under a particularly powerful or
charismatic leader.  Their veneration of ancient heroes is known to border
on ancestor worship.  

Generally, kankoran do not adhere to any rule or law that is not one of
their own.  Their behaviors tend to typify what one would expect of a feral
pack, and their rule is often one of strength or violence than peace.  In
more recent times, kankoran have integrated, to a limited degree, into the
greater racial tapestry.  However, those are the exception, not the rule.  

In modern times, kankoran have sought new territory outside of their more
typical racial homes.  They are an oddity among Avendar\@s seafaring races,
treating their ships as a small pack in and of itself.  They are given to
banditry, and have established small dens or harbors in small niches outside
of the mainstream.

{WSrryn: Section 1{x

The srryn are a race of cold-blooded, bipedal reptiles.  Covered with tough
scales and born with whip-like tails, they are cunning warriors who often
use their natural speed and strength to good advantage.  They mainly dwell
in swamps, lowlands, and deserts, and are well-known for their long history
as itinerant raiders of nearby settlements.  Srryn leadership often comes
with age, predicated on the assumption that no incompetent would survive
that long.  

Despite their primitive trappings, the srryn are one of Avendar\@s oldest
races, with their rise coming shortly after the Sundering.  The earliest
written records of the srryn come from the aelin, concerning their
proclivity for raids and measures taken to combat them.  The aelin viewed
the srryn as utterly hopeless primitives, and considered them a nuisance at
best.  

According to the srryn, all reptiles were born to a powerful but
disinterested mother-deity called Fenthira.  This goddess laid many eggs
throughout the world of Avendar, and from each sprung different evolutions
of reptilian life.  One such egg was called Sythtys, which became a great
swamp south of the Dantaron river valley.  
~
E
srrynsec2~
{WSrryn: Section 2{x

Powerful srryn rose and fell, but one of particular power was called
Sythrak.  It is said that it was through Him that the srryn race discovered
the magics of Fire.  This single event changed the course of both srryn and
Avendarian history, as it transformed a race of primitive, bickering
warlords into a force to be reckoned with.  

Cowing the humans who lived around them with the power of their newfound
magic, the srryn began a series of campaigns to unite their reptilian
factions.  As they clashed with more powerful and well-armed humans, the
srryn reached something of an impasse.  An exchange was brokered between
humanity and the srryn: the metal weapons and armor of the humans, for the
fiery magic of the srryn.  

The two races turned their attention to the longstanding master-race, the
aelin.  The srryn and their human allies came against the aelin with the
suddenness of an inferno, and reduced many of their cities to ashes.  The
massive destruction and countless deaths heralded the beginning of the War
of Fire, the most destructive conflict since the Sundering.  
~
E
srrynsec3~
{WSrryn: Section 3{x

At first, it seemed the mighty aelin civilization would fall quickly, as one
by one their cities were overrun.  Once the aelin realized the nature of the
threat, however, they rallied their republic to face the invaders.  Using
their swordmastery and the relics of the fallen alatharya, the aelin
followed with a series of counterstrikes, pushing the srryn to a stalemate. 

The stalemate, however, was an untenable one.  The srryn and humans were
both virile races, swelling in numbers quickly.  Furthermore, their magic
was strong and plentiful.  Meanwhile, the aelin took time to renew
themselves, and their success depended on the rapidly fading power of
ancient artifacts, inferior weapons, and force of will.  

In the end, the srryn lines did not break until entirely new forces came
into play.  Humans not allied with the srryn joined with a daring minority
of the aelin, and following the words of an alatharyan prophecy, embarked on
a journey to the far north to awaken the sleeping god, Jolinn.  The magics
of Water would lead to the War\@s end, with much of the world left in ruins. 
The srryn were driven back, many of them to Sythtys, where they hid
themselves from the victorious aelin and humans.  
~
E
srrynsec4~
{WSrryn: Section 4{x

The rise of the Republic of Earendam left the srryn an isolated people. 
Sythrak, whose magics had sparked the srryn will to dominate, was driven out
of Sythtys by His brother, Sitheus.  He, in turn, encouraged the srryn to
not give into the easy temptations of immediate victory, and instead hone
their skills for a renewed assault on both the aelin, and humanity.  

They did so, content to occasionally raid or waylay what travelers were fool
enough to enter their domains.  With the rise of the War of Night, the srryn
allied themselves briefly with the shuddeni.  During this time, Sitheus
embraced the power of Void for the purposes of undeath, believing that He
could unlock the secret to an undying army of warlords.  However, the srryn
did not preserve their alliance with the shuddeni for long, as it was clear
the eyeless race had no intention of sharing power.  

Sythrak, angered by His exile, returned to Sythtys with a vengeance.  He
challenged Sitheus, proclaiming that the saurian lord wished to subjugate
the srryn race to the shuddeni.  The two battled, and the immense fury of
their attacks caused fire to rain down over the swamps for six months.  In
the end, Sythrak\@s might was greater, and He utterly destroyed Sitheus\@
body.  He banished the fallen srryn\@s spirit from Sythtys forever, and
proclaimed Himself as the one true god of the mire.  
~
E
srrynsec5~
{WSrryn: Section 5{x

In the ages since, srryn have integrated themselves more fully into
Avendarian society.  With the expulsion of Sitheus from the swamp, many
srryn have found themselves more willing to live outside of their most
famous racial home.  As well, new sects of srryn have arisen in the southern
wastes, and in the areas bordering the Crimson Sands.  If anything, the
conflicts have made them stronger and more diverse.  

Because of the conspicuous actions of some srryn in the service of the human
city-states during the modern era, the race has garnered, as a whole, a bit
of additional respectability.  They can be found as gladiators, shopkeepers,
or guards, or on the fringes of human society as bandit-kings.  No longer
universally feared, the srryn are still distrusted, and by no means ignored
by the other races of Avendar.

{WCaladaran: Section 1{x

In the age following the Sundering, the caladaran race rose under the
tutelage of two planar travelers: Chadraln the Seer, and Jalassa the
Disciplined.  The pair of them nurtured the young caladaran in the far-flung
glades of the Rirro Jagka, to the south and east of the Dantaron river
valley.  It was here that the race developed its immense capacity for study
and reason.  

Eventually, the Seer would instruct the caladaran to embrace the magics of
Earth, and granted them knowledge of Iandir, one of Avendar\@s three
creators.  Their great capacity for magic made them natural adepts, and
their desire for order led many to embrace His law.  This knowledge drove a
wedge between Chadraln and Jalassa.  Unbeknownst to the caladaran, the War
of Fire\@s end was nigh by the time the first of them left their racial
glades.  

With their arrival in the human Republic of Earendam, the caladaran gifted
the new civilization with knowledge of Iandir, as well as His magic.  They
quickly took to the art of healing, and gifted to humanity the first
codified laws and the script which would form the basis of the common tongue
of the present.  
~
E
caladsec2~
{WCaladaran: Section 2{x

A second wave of caladaran would follow in the coming years, driven from
their home by warlike kankoran and alatharya.  These caladaran brought with
them their monastic tradition in earnest, as well as the precepts of
psionics.  They introduced to humanity the worship of Jalassa, who appealed
strongly to the human and aelin aristocracy.  It was during this time that a
leading acolyte of Jalassa, Adrajisk, would begin the fusion of mental
techniques that would become known as ginta\@cham\@akan.  

Those caladaran who did not acclimate to multi-racial fusion sought refuge
outside of Republican circles.  Many of them left human civilization for the
wild, in which they might settle in new monasteries or live as hermitic
lives.  The worship of Alajial originated with them; as the War of Night
took hold, this would be the primary face of the caladaran people.  Those
who participated in the conflict often served as healers, leaving the
majority of the fighting to the great heroes and heroines of other races.  

With the close of the War, the Alajian caladaran would help the ch\@taren
develop the new sphere of Spirit.  Their contributions were profound,
directing significant study in the application of magic to mental
tranquility.  The race itself, which had long grown apart in the development
of its three major creeds, began to again cross-pollinate.  This helped to
cement the general direction of the caladaran through the collapse of the
Republic.  
~
E
caladsec3~
{WCaladaran: Section 3{x

In the modern era, caladaran are often teachers, sages, or healers.  They
seldom act as warriors or men of the sword, instead focusing on their innate
wisdom to resolve conflicts.  They often prefer a solitary lifestyle, which
can lead to the classical representation of the caladaran hermit as well,
they can be found in monasteries devoted to Alajial or Jalassa.  Reason is
the most powerful tool a caladaran possesses, and the one with which he is
most adept.  

Caladaran are often known by their appearance and contemplative nature. 
Usually, they are tall and thin, with rough, bark-like skin.  This often
leads to a comparison with trees, which the caladaran often appreciate, due
to their long lifespans and attunement with the natural world.  Their faces
are humanoid, but rarely show the signs of age until they have advanced a
great many decades.

The ch\@taren race is the newest to join Avendar\@s racial tapestry, appearing
at the climax of the War of Night.  Early ch\@taren described themselves as
\@refugees\@, but also spoke of their lives on their home plane.  It was there
that they were born of the twin gods, Rystaia and Vaialos, and they were
imbued with the powers of Spirit.  

The precise location and character of the ch\@taren home plane is disputed,
as the concepts which characterize it cannot be expressed in current mortal
language.  What is known of it is that it was more fully attuned to the pure
force of life and the spirit realm.  The legendary living metal, ch\@lonin,
is said to have been forged there.  

Rystaia encouraged passion, joy, and zeal in the hearts of the ch\@taren,
while Her twin, Vaialos, encouraged the race\@s monumental intelligence and

{WShuddeni: Section 1{x

The shuddeni are a subterranean race, living in underground cities and
temples far below Avendar\@s surface.  They appear as extremely thin,
ashen-grey humanoids.  They possess no body hair, and often apply oil to the
unusual folds and ridges of their skin.  Their most distinctive trait is the
complete absence of eyes.  Instead, they have nothing but a slight
indentation there, and no open or empty eye sockets.  Thus, shuddeni possess
an unusual and alien sense of sight that is not fully understood.  

Most shuddeni culture revolves around life in their cities, which were
originally established by successful clans of shuddeni.  In time, the holds
of these clans came to incorporate their allies, until they eventually grew
large enough to sustain themselves.  Shuddeni cities are typically dominated
by a ruling caste of priests, who maintain their power through magic,
wealth, and fear.  

The shuddeni race is said to have been shaped by Tzet-Askhari, Great Dragon
of the Void.  They are thought to be Its chosen children; through them, It
unleashed the diabolic magics of Void and demonkind into mortal Avendar. 
The time of their rise is not fully understood, only that by the time of
their contact with humanity, the Dragon\@s grip was absolute.  
~
E
shudsec2~
{WShuddeni: Section 2{x

Human contact with the shuddeni occurred in the years leading up to the War
of Night.  Mining expeditions in the Brintors revealed a passage into the
underworld of the shuddeni, and opened up a permanent link between the
shuddeni settlement of Yithoul and the surface.  After several initial,
failed ventures, the shuddeni established a working relationship with the
Republic.  

What the senate did not know was that these initial peace overtures were
merely the first step in a campaign of shuddeni conquest.  Extending their
power to disenfranchised groups, such as the srryn or humans desirous of
forbidden magic, the shuddeni began to gather allies and prepare themselves
for battle.  

When the shuddeni burst to the surface, they brought with them the
nightmarish magics of Void, which included demonic servitors and horrifying
plagues.  As well, the shuddeni legions were bolstered by their savage chaja
slaves.  The shuddeni first struck in the Brintors, emerging through a
formerly unknown link to the surface world.  
~
E
shudsec3~
{WShuddeni: Section 3{x

Once the shuddeni offensive began, the warlike srryn and dissatisfied humans
fostered conflict and rebellion on the southern front.  The shuddeni
consolidated their foothold in the Brintors, and began a quest of expansion,
establishing themselves in human settlements throughout the mountains.  Once
secure, shuddeni conquest slowed, but remained dreadfully certain.  

As humans and their allies fought in desperation, the shuddeni sought a
swift and complete victory.  They drew together the greatest archmagi of
their people, and began to fashion an immense nexus to the outer void.  The
gateway was to open for three days, allowing the greatest demonic host ever
conceived to assemble and march upon Earendam.  

The result of their summoning, however, was not what they expected.  Fleeing
the ravages of Tzet-Askhari, the ch\@taren and their goddess, Rystaia
Lightbringer, emerged onto the Prime.  These refugees brought with them the
magics of Spirit, which shattered demonic and shuddeni forces with vengeful
abandon.  
~
E
shudsec5~
{WShuddeni: Section 5{x

In the modern era, shuddeni have integrated themselves into surface society
on an unprecedented scale.  This led to the rise of their newest god,
Rveyelhi, whose oppressive designs have often been forwarded by the
adventurer caste.  Their prodigious intellect has seen their expansion into
any number of domains, in business, magic, and study.  

As a race, they are still mistrusted, but generally accepted as a necessary
evil during the post-War detente.  They have continued to push the limits of
what the surface is willing to tolerate, as they led a daring and bloody
series of battles against allied forces known as the Eyeblight War.  Their
hatred of the ch\@taren, in particular, was especially evident before their
defeat.  

Below the surface, shuddeni still scheme, and undoubtedly intend further
conquest.  They view themselves as the predestined rulers of Avendar, and
the claws of the Deathbringer, Tzet-Askhari.  
~
E
shudsec4~
{WShuddeni: Section 4{x

With the defeat of the shuddeni and the end of the War of Night, the
shuddeni racial ego was deeply wounded.  How could the might of their
Father, the mighty Tzet-Askhari, have failed?  It was during this time that
a new god rose to bloody power within the shuddeni temples.  He called
Himself Arkhural, and mobilized the remnants of the shuddeni war machine.  

At Arkhural\@s bidding, the shuddeni marched upon the fledgling havens of the
ch\@taren who had so smote them.  They arrived at Ad\@masteisa, the haven of
wind, and wiped it from the face of the earth.  Even with their eventual
defeat by the Warband of Calaera, the crushing blow dealt to the ch\@taren
was more than enough to cement Arkhural\@s power for the ages to come.  

To prevent more shuddeni incursions onto the surface, the keep of Kor
Thrandir was built upon their most direct path, and a great seal erected. 
Despite their obvious evil, shuddeni ties to the surface world were never
fully ended.  The weakening of the Republic allowed shuddeni scholarship and
magic to flourish and draw interracial attention.  Their bizarre music and
exotic bards also found great fame by way of entrenched nobility.

Humans are Avendar\@s most adaptable race, with a presence in almost all of
the world\@s locales.  Humans trace their origin to a time following the fall
of the ancient alatharya, with their first civilizations growing in the
Dantaron river valley and the southeastern coast of the lower continent.  

The aelin provide the first written records of humanity, portraying them as
savages \@on the border of beginning a civilized existence\@.  The aelin
generally left humans to themselves, considering them a barbarous curiosity
rather than true equals.  Humans had little of value, so trade was all but
non-existent.  

However, the coming of Dolgrael gave humanity its first true direction, and
gave the young race both a martial foothold and its first movements toward
civilization.  Iron weapons gave them a distinct advantage, and one that
would prove necessary with the coming of the srryn and their Fire magic. 
This step transformed a race of itinerant raiders to potential warlords. 
The human embrace of the flame was all but inevitable.  
~
E
humansec2~
{WHumans: Section 2{x

Humans proved apt pupils for the magics of Fire, inspired as they were by
the mad drive of Lilune, the moon goddess.  With their aid, the srryn
brought conflict to the ancient empires of the aelin.  This war, which would
be remembered as the War of Fire, went extremely well for the srryn and
humans at first, with aelin cities toppling before the new and destructive
magics of Fire.  

Given time, the aelin organized a staunch resistance, rallying their
collection of alatharya artifacts to aid them.  They called upon the
blessings of their deific parents, Aeolis and Alia, to preserve them in
their time of need.  The pace of victory slowed, and while the humans and
srryn still found some success, the rapacity of the srryn combatants led to
increasing losses.  

This resistance bought precious time; soon, a rogue band of humans,
dissatisfied with a life of bloody conquest, dared to ally themselves with
the embattled aelin.  The most famous aelin hero, Marlax, accepted the aid
of these humans, who in turn helped he and the aelin defend their cities.  
~
E
humansec3~
{WHumans: Section 3{x

The humans proved more useful to the aelin than just simple city defenders. 
The scholars of the aelin, with their many artifacts and prophesies from the
end of the alatharyan age, discovered the presence of the slumbering god,
Jolinn, in the far north.  They sent the hardy humans, and some of their
own, to seek the Titans of Castle Nathli.  Marlax stayed behind, interested
only in battle.  

This journey has since become legend, and is recorded in greater detail in
other texts [See Tyalin\@s \@The Quest of Aramril\@, or the poem of the same
name by the poet Quarentis], and the humans and their aelin cohorts awakened
the slumbering god and discovered the magics of Water.  It is said that
Aramril\@s great hammer was infused with holy power, and he who sealed the
pact with Aranthas, son of the Titan king, to rout the srryn.  

With these new allies, the aelin fought a series of cataclysmic battles,
driving the srryn back to their swamps.  The human leaders who had allied
with the srryn were slain, either in battle, or executed by victorious
forces.  
~
E
humansec4~
{WHumans: Section 4{x

In return for their aid, the aelin cooperated with their human allies in
creating a new human government.  The heroes of the War of Fire were
situated in key positions of power.  Avendar\@s surface had been ravaged by
the many devastating battles, laying waste to fertile lands and creating the
permanent southern scar known as the Crimson Sands.  

The period following the War, however, was one of sustained prosperity.  The
humans established lasting trade with the aelin, who were in desperate need
of the fertile natural resources of the lowlands.  In return, the humans
grew fond of the mineral wealth of the mountains upon which many great aelin
cities had been built.  

Culturally, the humans were greatly influenced by the aelin\@s unique
republican government.  As well, the arrival of the caladaran brought to
humanity the magics of Earth, as well as an introduction to the monastic
tradition.  These factors led to the rise of one of the greatest human
empires: the Republic of Earendam.  
~
E
humansec5~
{WHumans: Section 5{x

The Republic became a mainstay of Avendar\@s political landscape, offering
protection and peace to numerous human settlements.  Inevitably, these
regions were incorporated into the Earendamian cultural empire.  With this
increased expansion, the aelin looked inward, more inclined to isolation
than cooperation.  To many, this marked the end of the golden age of the
aelin.  

During the heyday of the Republic, the extent of territory was particularly
vast, incorporating Lithling Valley, stretching to the Uthlin Ocean, across
the Arien Plains to Qilarn, north into the Brintor Mountains, and south to
encompass the trade outpost of Var Bandor.  What the leaders of the Republic
had no way of realizing, however, was that this expansion would imperil
their way of life.  

Mining ever more deeply into the Brintors, humans eventually found their way
to the underworld of the shuddeni.  Eyeless and horrifying, the shuddeni
initially sought diplomatic ties with the Republic by way of the Archmage,
Kaagn.  The decadence of the Republic proved easily susceptible to the
temptations of the shuddeni and their magics of Void.  
~
E
humansec6~
{WHumans: Section 6{x

When the shuddeni had sufficiently infiltrated human society, they brought
their armies to the surface through a hereto-undiscovered passage up through
the Brintors.  They began their conquest backed by legions of their brutish
chaja slaves, as well as the might of the Dragon\@s demonkind.  

The first winter of the War of Night marked the beginning of the shuddeni
offensive.  Terror gripped the human provinces of the Brintors, with many
unprepared humans sacrificed to the shuddeni\@s dark god, Tzet-Askhari.  With
the closing of passes during the winter months, the shuddeni fortified their
positions and sent for reinforcements.  

Elsewhere in Avendar, the Republic was faced with both internal dissent and
the eagerness of the srryn, who rallied for battle.  They harried human
forces as they attempted to assemble and thwart the growing shuddeni menace.
~
E
humansec7~
{WHumans: Section 7{x

With spring came an escalation of conflict, as the forces of Earendam met
the shuddeni army in a series of bloody battles.  Humans were unused to the
dread power of Void, leading to many losses and retreats.  This continued
for the first two years of the war, with humans making only marginal gains,
if any.  

Given time, the humans adapted to some of the shuddeni battle tactics. 
After the close of the second year of the War, the humans began to hold
their own.  With the coming of Aeolian warriors from across the Sea of
Lidreau, humans seemed prepared to entrench their defense for some time to
come.  

Eager to prevent protraction, the shuddeni turned once more to their dark
magics.  Calling together their greatest archmagi, the shuddeni attempted
the greatest summoning of demonkind ever to be attempted in recorded
history.  Their dark rite prepared, the gateway opened; but through it came
the host that would turn the tide in favor of humanity.  The ch\@taren and
their goddess, Rystaia Lightbringer arrived through the shuddeni nexus,
dooming the shuddeni forces with the magics of Spirit.  
~
E
humansec8~
{WHumans: Section 8{x

With the aid of the ch\@taren and their powerful magics, the shuddeni were
driven back beneath the surface of Avendar.  Although relief was palpable
throughout the world, the Republic\@s strength and unity were shattered.  Its
great army crippled, it was only a matter of time before rival leaders rose
in other human settlements.  

A patchwork of independent city states replaced the once mighty empire as
its grip disintegrated.  The trade city of Var Bandor severed its ties; the
city of Gaald proclaimed its heritage as the inheritor of the mantle of
Caal; and the nation of Gogoth grew only more defiant in the wake of the
shuddeni defeat.  

Despite this, the Republic continued as the reigning human institution of
the region for the next two and a half centuries.  The invasions of the
kankoran rang the death knell for the Republic, led by their mighty war-god
Khanval.  The humans were both militarily and financially unequipped to fend
off a full-scale invasion.  
~
E
humansec9~
{WHumans: Section 9{x

Although the barbarian hordes were driven east, toward the Rirro Jagka, the
invasion destroyed all faith in the Earendamian senate.  With the rise of
the office of the Patrician, Earendam became an independent city state.  It
severed its direct defensive ties with all but its closest province,
Lithling Valley.  

In the modern era, human society has started to find a bit of consensus
within itself.  It remains politically divided, but has gained a certain
strength to deal with Avendar\@s other races.  Less isolated than the aelin,
less violent than the kankoran, and less dangerous than the shuddeni, the
humans have succeeded both as diplomats and rulers, preserving their place
as Avendar\@s dominant race.

{WChaja: Section 1{x

Chaja are a subterranean race, strong and healthy despite generations of
systematic enslavement by the shuddeni.  Few are born feral, with the vast
majority born into bondage in the underground cities of their masters. 
Traditionally meek and servile, those chaja who know war are often notorious
for their bloody and sudden rampages.  

The story of the chaja is a sad one, as they did little, if anything to
deserve the suffering which has been inflicted upon them.  The precise
origin of the race is not wholly understood, but the general consensus is
that they were already living in the underworld that the shuddeni would
eventually come to inhabit.  At that point, these giants were peaceful, or
at least tolerant.  

The few scholars study the history of the chaja suggest that their first
interaction with the eyeless began with shuddeni overtures of peace. 
However, in time, they drew them under the lash and reduced them to
never-ending servitude; a model the shuddeni would seek to duplicate in the
lead-up to the War of Night on the races of the surface.  If the chaja had a
culture of their own, it has long been forgotten, even amongst themselves.  
~
E
chajasec2~
{WChaja: Section 2{x

At the bidding of their masters, the chaja constructed the vast underground
empires of the shuddeni.  They are credited with the construction of their
great temples and the carving out of their cavern walls.  The chaja were so
thoroughly dominated by this process that they wholly accepted their
slave-role, their minds and wills growing ever weaker with each generation. 

With each new construction came more shuddeni power, and the chaja were
darkened by the many evils that suffused their masters.  They often came to
share the bent of the shuddeni, and savored the ability to crush those who
they were tasked to face.  In time, the beginning of the War of Night would
give the chaja untold legions to face.  

The crushing defeat of their masters by the ch\@taren gave the chaja an
unusual opportunity.  Scattered by their foes, some used this short window
to escape from bondage and strike out into Avendar proper.  Unfortunately,
chaja were as mistrusted as shuddeni, and without the leashes of their
masters to lead them, those who were free eventually longed to return to
servitude.  
~
E
chajasec3~
{WChaja: Section 3{x

With the coming of the modern era, the chaja have existed both within and
outside shuddeni society.  Those who have been a part of the major shuddeni
campaigns have been as virtually all of their ancestors: the powerful right
hand of their masters.  As for those who do not, they have managed a quiet
existence either living ferally beneath the earth, or as servants to
tolerant humans.  

Chaja average between six and eight feet in height, and have dusky, black
skin.  They have milk-white eyes, and possess no affinity for magic.  As
well, their minds are notoriously weak and prone to fear after generations
of torment at the hands of the shuddeni.  Thick hair covers their bodies,
and gives even the \#civil\# among them a wild and animalish look.  

The chaja demeanor is often one of extremes.  They trend toward meekness and
suggestion, but also are prone to extremely violent rages.  An innate
bloodlust has become a part of them over the long centuries of battle,
either for pleasure or war, which only serves to make them more dangerous. 
Although some compare them to the alatharya, the two races serve far more to
contrast one another than to find commonality.

Avendar Basic Command Tutorial~
Now that you are familiar with basic movement, {Wlook{x, and {Wexamine{x,
there are some other commands you should be familiar with.  The first is
{Wequipment{x, which will show you the items your character is wearing. 
Type {Wequipment{x and you will note you don\@t have any yet!  The second is
{Winventory{x, which will list all of the items your character is carrying. 
If you type {Winventory{x, you will note that you don\@t have anything there
either.  Once you complete this tutorial, that will change.  

Another very important command is {Wscore{x.  You may remember that when you
completed the creation process, you saw an overview of your character which
you confirmed before you began playing.  When you type {Wscore{x, you will
see that overview again.  This can be really helpful for checking your
character\@s various stats or other information.

The Hall of Victors houses the emissary of the family of the School of
Heroes\@ illustrious founder, and it is his task to reward those valiant
young adventurers who complete the Tower of Testing.  The rough-hewn stone
of the arched entryway gives way to a set of two large steps, and then a
large, circular platform made of polished tiles.  The walls transition
almost immediately into the School\@s characteristic marble.  The entrance to
the Hall of Victors lies to the west, while an opulent chamber lies to the
south in its interior.

This massive statue is divided into two halves.  The first, made entirely

flames of war, and a massive hammer rests in his tremendous hands.  He is
armored in plate mail, save a helmet, leaving his head fully visible.  

The other half is a silvery, feminine figure.  She is heavily stylized,
bearing two separate faces.  One possesses two diamond eyes and a soothing
smile; the other has eyes of inset ruby and a fierce, grinning mouth.  Her
body is lithe and robed in draping, silken cloth.  

The two forms are fused at the back to one another, never to face each
other.  His clutched fist and her outstretched hand beckon to all who see

Before you stand the gates of the School of Heroes, the renowned center
of training for young adventurers.  It is an enormous structure, composed of
marble, stone, and brick, and has been built upon a rocky hill.  The gates
are forged of wrought iron, and remain open to travelers of every size,
affiliation, and creed.  The central foyer of the School lies ahead, the
marble edifice looming over its well-worn gates.  A small courtyard opens
here, with a beautiful central fountain and a circle of low bushes.

The Hall of Trials~
The Hall of Trials is intended to help students of the School of Heroes
to learn how to overcome basic obstacles and use universal techniques.  This
includes physical barriers, environmental conditions, and abilities
available to all adventurers.  The Hall is incredibly old, built of
rough-hewn blocks that have the musty scent of age.  The floor has been worn
smooth by generations of young adventurers walking upon it, but is generally
swept clean of debris.  At regular intervals along the ceiling are oil
lanterns, which cast shadows throughout.  To the west, a doorway leads to an
adjoining hallway.

The Test of Keys~
This side corridor is significantly smaller than the main Hall of Trials.
Part of the Test of Keys, it teaches students about the presence of locked
doors and how to use keys.  The corridor is in slightly worse repair than
the adjoining Hall, with its stone walls not quite so straight or allowing
the slow encroachment of moss upon them.  A bit of water drips from the
ceiling, giving the corridor a far more dank feel than much of the School. 
Lamplight illuminates the passage, although its shine seems surprisingly
tenuous.  A door stands to the east, while the corridor continues westward.

The Test of Keys~
The side corridor runs east and west, sloping downward as it proceeds
westward.  The walls are cut from rough-hewn stone, and the passing of
endless years has left them uneven.  Tiny patches of moss cling to the rock,
and a slow drip of water makes the close air damp as well as musty.  Hanging
lamps light the corridor, although they flicker off and on, making that
light seem less steady than the floors above.  To the west, the corridor
comes to an end, while to the east, it continues until its termination at a

A Filthy End of the Corridor~
The side corridor comes to a stop here, its ceiling low and damp with
moisture.  The air here is particularly close, and the stone and floor show
signs of habitation.  Organic debris litters the stone floor, as well as
splatters upon the wall which look like bloodstains.  Dirt and grime are
present here more than anywhere else in the School, giving the corridor\@s
musty scent an even more suffocating cast.  A single lamp hangs from the
ceiling, its leaping flame giving the room an ominous look.  The corridor
continues to the east.

The imp in this room has the {Wkey{x that will facilitate your escape.

creature is before you attack it.  But beware!  Using consider before common
sense can be deadly!  

So, as a general rule, consider first, then attack.  To kill this imp, type
{Wkill imp{x.  

Once you have defeated the imp, check your {Winventory{x to make sure you

{Wexamine{x, {Wequipment{x, {Winventory{x, {Wscore{x, {Waffects{x, movement
commands, skill list commands, and help.  But what if you have questions or
you\@re not sure what to do next?  

We have a channel for new players called the {Wnewbie{x channel.  As you
selected that you are new to Avendar during creation, the newbie channel is
already turned on for you.  To ask a question, simply type {Wnewbie <your
question>{x.  Other players and staff members will see your question, and
can help you figure out your issue or tell you where to look for more
information.  

Now that we\@ve covered these basics, you are now ready to enter the School
of Heroes.  This area will teach you about Avendar in general, as well as
introduce you more to how the game is actually played.  We hope you\@ll enjoy
Avendar as much as we have over the years!

Avendar Basic Command Tutorial~
At times you will want to know what skills or spells are {Waffecting{x
your character.  To do this, you can type {Waffects{x, which will give you a
listing of all of the different things temporarily modifying your
character\@s statistics or abilities.  Often, the names of these abilities
are entries in Avendar\@s {Whelp{x system.  If you ever wonder what a skill
or ability does, check {Whelp <skill name>{x for additional information.  

If you want to see what {Wskills{x, {Wspells{x, {Wabilities{x, {Wsongs{x, or
{Wforms{x your character will receive as they level, you should use their
respective commands (for example, type {Wskills{x to see what skills you
have and will get, and when).  These lists will give you a quick idea of
what to expect from your class as you gain {Wlevels{x.  

If you\@re not comfortable checking these lists, you can visit our website,
{Whttp://www.avendar.com/{x and look at the class entry for your respective
class.  You can also click on {Whelp{x to access the in-game help system
from the website.  If you are not logged in and want to look something up,
this is probably the best way to do so.

The gilded ceiling of the Hall of Arms continues into this branch, the

are less tall, but no less impressive, their pale stone surfaces brushed
smooth.  Various examples of the School\@s weaponsmith hang on display,
including crested shields and crossed swords.  The Hall itself is lit by
white globes of light, lit by magic rather than flame.  A finely varnished
wooden desk sits within the Hall, and behind it are a variety of crates
containing various weapons to be handed out.  The scent of the forge lingers

This small room is not far from the marble stairs which descend into the
Adventurer\@s Lounge.  Called the Chamber of the Voice, it houses one of the
School\@s most distinguished magical entities: the magic mouth.  Although its
origin is the subject of many rumors, it is both animate and aware.  It
chose this space for itself not long after the initial renovation of the
lounge, so it could be in close proximity to the School\@s center of
conversation.  The room itself is a simple affair, with matching hardwood
paneling and flooring.  Two potted plants sit near the rear of the room, one
in each corner, with a globe of light at the ceiling\@s center.  The
Adventurer\@s Lounge awaits to the north.

Communication is a vital aspect of Avendar and can take many forms. 
Learning how to effectively use these modes will greatly enhance your
ability to roleplay and progress.  

To speak aloud so everyone in your current room can hear, use {Wsay{x.  Says
are highlighted in yellow, and compose a large portion of how you will
interact with others.  To say something, you would type {Wsay <phrase>{x. 
Remember to capitalize and punctuate!  

{WExample: say Hello.  {x

To speak privately to another person, use {Wtell{x.  Unlike some other MUDs,
tells are considered in-character in Avendar.  This allows you to conduct
conversations that are not easily overheard, both in the same room or at a
distance.  Tells are an important way to interact with others if you can\@t
find them.  The syntax is {Wtell <name> <message>{x, or {Wreply <message>{x.

{WExample: tell jolinn Hello.{x
         {Wreply Hello.{x

To make your text visible to an entire {Warea{x, use {Wyell{x.  This is not
the most common mode of communication, but is often used automatically
when you are attacked by another player.  If you are trapped, the yell
command can be helpful when trying to get help.  

{WExample: yell Help!  {x

Finally, if you need to speak with another character in an out-of-character
way, use {WOOC{x.  OOC text is highlighted in red, and should only be used
when it is absolutely necessary.  Generally, most communications in Avendar
are intended to be in-character, so conversations in the OOC channel are
usually brief.  OOC\@s syntax is similar to that of tell.  

{WExample: ooc jolinn That was awesome.{x

The Test of the Statue~
The room which houses the Test of the Statue is almost perfectly cubical,
walled with a series of rough-hewn blocks.  Unlike much of the Hall of
Trials, this room seems less ancient and more heavily trafficked.  Fully ten
feet on a side, the only notable feature of the room is a freestanding
pedestal at the room\@s center.  Atop the pedestal is a stone statue, carved
in the likeness of a stone gargoyle.  A lantern hanging from the ceiling
casts the room with fickle light.  The Hall of Trials lies to the west.

that it contains four magical gateways which connect the School of Heroes to
various locations in Avendar.  Each glowing with soft blue light, the three
vertical portals are set into the eastern, western, and southern walls.  The
fourth portal is horizontal and circular, and is set into the floor directly

The Hall of Trials~
The Hall of Trials is intended to help students of the School of Heroes
to learn how to overcome basic obstacles and use universal techniques.  This
includes physical barriers, environmental conditions, and abilities
available to all adventurers.  The Hall is incredibly old, built of
rough-hewn blocks that have the musty scent of age.  The floor has been worn
smooth by generations of young adventurers walking upon it, but is generally
swept clean of debris.  At regular intervals along the ceiling are oil
lanterns, which cast shadows throughout.  To the east, a low doorway leads
into an adjoining room.  

A plaque near the door reads, \#The Test of Belief\#.

The Entrance to the Hall of Victors~
This spur off of the Adventurer\@s Lounge leads to a tremendous archway. 
It is particularly ancient, even for the School, and is marked by
now-unreadable druidic markings.  Whatever the original use for this
still-standing arch, the long-forgotten laborers who built the School used
it as a transition into another underground Hall.  Named the Hall of
Victors, it is designed to reward those who complete the School\@s many
trials.  The wooden floor of the west gives way to a rough-hewn stone not
altogether unlike the Tower of Testing, creating a regal but imposing
effect.  Two mounted globes of light illuminate the archway.  The Hall\@s
interior lies east, while the lounge is to the west.  

A small note is tacked to the archway.

Once you\@ve graduated from the school, you\@ll need brave
companions for the road, friends and allies to share
in your adventures and to swap tales and compare feats
and accomplishments with. Come look up the Wanderers of 
Avendar in our stronghold at the foot of the Mlejian 
mountains, in the Savannah past the Woods of Nendor.

An Exotic Parlor in the Hall of Victors~
A great octagonal room, this sumptuous parlor opens up to a fantastically
high ceiling.  Many thick, blood-red drapes shroud the marblework of its
walls, giving it a great tent-like atmosphere.  Just above the sturdy bronze
rodding that holds the drapery aloft, the ceiling slopes upward into a
sharp, open-topped steeple.  A number of polished, dull orbs of light line
the interior of the steeple\@s high point, the bronze chains that dangle
beneath them glittering like tiny stars.  Against the south wall, a massive
and ornate divan dominates the room, its elaborate designs only heightening
the general exoticism.  Much of the floor is covered by a circluar farsh
rug, covering the polished Harrudim tile beneath it.  The scents of spice
hang in the dim, smoky air, giving the parlor an even more opulent flair.

The Entrance to the Tower of Testing~
Just north of the Adventurer\@s Lounge lies a connecting junction between
it and the Tower of Testing.  This dimly lit vestibule is made of rougher
hewn stone than the smooth bricks of the School proper, giving it a more
ominous air.  A hanging oil lantern which dangles from the ceiling only
enhances this mood, its unsteady light filling the room with trembling
shadows.  Engraved into the stone floor is the iconic sigil of the School of
Heroes, which serves as this chamber\@s only real ornamentation.  To the
north, the Tower awaits, the many sounds of its beasts echoing off of the
ancient stone walls.

A standing sign offers information to students.

standing sign information~
Welcome to the {WTower of Testing{x!  Here, your mettle will be tested in
physical combat.  This will include lizards, imps, and other assorted
beasts.  Your goal is simple: defeat them and survive.  On the first level,
monsters will neither attack you first, nor chase you if you run.  

If the foes you encounter are too difficult, you can escape them using
{Wflee{x.  This will cause you to run in a random direction away from
whatever was fighting.  If you really get into trouble, you can also
{Wrecall{x, which will take you to a temple and its healer.  You can
re-enter the School of Heroes from there by going {Wdown{x.

A Small Delivery Office~
This small office is walled with the same white-stone blocks as are used
in the Hall of Arms and lined with similar iron sconces.  It is decorated
with hanging burgundy tapestries, giving it a richer, more mercantile feel. 
A small wooden desk and chair sit against the western wall, bearing a tiny
inkwell and quill-stand.  The ceiling is low and plain, the light from the
sconces playing across its uneven surface.  Open doorways lead out of the
office to the north and south, with the northern portal shimmering with
magical energy.

Got Rules?~
\#Young men know the rules, but old men know the exceptions.\#
  - Oliver Wendell Holmes
  
The Hero Day rules are these:
  
 1) No multicharring. Play one character at a time.
 2) No spamming, intentional bug abuse, or other such lameness.
 3) Maintain the in-character/out-of-character distinction.
  
We reserve the right to personalize a longer list for anyone who
seems to be, in our opinions, out to spoil the fun for others.

The Foyer of the School of Heroes~
The School of Heroes begins with a grand foyer, complete with a vaulted
ceiling held aloft by great marble columns.  The room is spacious and airy,
with high, white marble walls and mounted, shining globes to provide light. 
Two great marble stairways sit back, just off center toward the room\@s north
side.  One ascends to an upper level of the School, and spirals about a
great glass pillar as it rises.  A well-made desk sits not far from the
foyer\@s entrance, giving the receptionist an opportunity to greet new
students.  The other descends to a lower level, and voices echo from its
depths.  Three halls open to the north, east, and west, leading to other
branches of the School.  The corridor to the south leads to the School\@s
iron gates.  

A large sign sits off to one side, offering directions to students.

The Entrance to the Hall of Knowledge~
A large, imposing chamber, the entry to the Hall of Knowledge is composed
of almost entirely white marble.  The domed ceiling at first appears
transparent; upon closer inspection, it is in fact an illusion of Avendar\@s
starscape.  The room is lit by dim globes of light, which are affixed to the
walls in lieu of torches.  The dark floor\@s high polish reflects the
enchantment above, giving the room a slightly disorienting feel.
