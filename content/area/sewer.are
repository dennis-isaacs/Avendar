Mofi short human snake oil~
Mofi~
A short human sits on a crate, a box of vials in his lap.
~
\#Snake Oil\# Mofi, brother of Aribban the peddler, is short for a human at
about five feet two inches.  Well beyond his prime, he is as portly as he is
short, but has the appearance of one who hasn\@t lose strength despite
present conditioning and age.  A two-day stubble darkens his chin and
cheeks.  His curly black hair is streaked with grey and is slicked back in a
thick tangled mass which reeks of animal lard.

Kruz deformed nefortu~
Kruz~
A deformed nefortu stands here, peddling a tray of used wands.
~
An old nefortu, his face horribly deformed as if by fire or acid, stands
here.  His nose is missing except for a small irregular stub of flesh that
line the bare, scarred slits of his nostrils, and his lips are
misproportioned and set at odd angles.  He holds out an old worn tray lined
in faded green velvet, whereupon rest many equally old and worn wands.

This wiry nefortu has a skulking, furtive look about him.  Though
possessing a skinny, wiry strength, the nefortu has regardless developed a
bit of a paunch recently.  The few ragged clothes he wears are quite
ill-fitted to his form.  Bat-like membraneous wings stretch from his arms to
his body, allowing him flight when he so chooses.

This shuddeni is rather fat, wrinkled grey skin sagging in baggy folds. 
Eyeless sockets are covered with parchmentlike skin, and the rest of the
face is as drawn and taut as a sun-baked corpse.  A short neck disappears
into his robe, several chins lolling unpleasantly.  Chubby hands of the same
corpse-grey move with avaricious zeal, and a ready, unctuous grin is full of
yellowing, broken teeth.

A suspicious srryn merchant stands here, guarding his merchandise.

This short srryn is stocky and compact, covered in dull-green scales
tinged around the edges with a smoky brown.  Wary eyes of an odd honey color
watch his surroundings, clawed hands clenched in readiness.  A short,
balancing tail protrudes from the back of his hips, and worn fangs jut past
his thin lips.  The srryn\@s forehead is rather low, the eyes oddly flat.

This kankoran is well over seven feet tall, powerfully-built body covered
in bristly red fur.  A long, fanged snout is flanked by glaringly alert eyes
of a cold, icy green.  The kankoran seems defensive and hostile, muscled
arms and legs moving with a predatorial wariness.  Torn, scarred ears twitch
about with paranoid energy, and his overlarge nostrils constantly test the

an enormous, spidery crab~
An enormous insectoid is here, long, slender legs arching from a quivering, baggy body.
~
This enormous spider-like crab has six long, segmented legs which arch
high into the air, the spindly, pointed appendages somehow conveying the
image of many more legs.  The long legs are covered in a tough exoskeleton
of mottled greyish brown, the dully reflective surface bespattered with
filthy sewage.  Countless rows of small, spiky hairs line the legs, the
stiff black bristles sharp and needle-like.  The legs converge at a small
body the shape of a flattened globe.  Several pairs of small, shiny black
eyes line the body, though no mouth is visible.  Slung underneath the
compact, flat body is a gelatinous bulge of baggy, leathery skin which
terminates in a limply swaying mass of glistening tentacles.  Foul
secretions drip from these tentacles, and a faint hissing sounds from the
revolting underside.

crab spidery spider mob_6113 insectoid large~
a large, spidery crab~
A large insectoid is here, slender, bristley legs arching from a baggy body.
~
Five feet from the ground, curving downwards slightly before joining a
round, flattened body.  The chitinous legs are covered in a tough
exoskeleton of mottled greyish brown, the dully reflective surface
bespattered with filthy sewage.  Countless rows of small, spiky hairs line
the legs, the stiff black bristles sharp and needle-like.  Several pairs of
small, shiny black eyes line the body, though no mouth is visible.  Slung
underneath the compact, flat body is a gelatinous bulge of baggy, leathery
skin which terminates in a limply swaying mass of glistening tentacles. 
Foul secretions drip from these tentacles, and a faint hissing sounds from
the revolting underside.

an enormous, spidery crab~
An enormous insectoid is here, long, slender legs arching from a quivering, baggy body.
~
This enormous spider-like crab has six long, segmented legs which arch
high into the air, the spindly, pointed appendages somehow conveying the
image of many more legs.  The long legs are covered in a tough exoskeleton
of mottled greyish brown, the dully reflective surface bespattered with
filthy sewage.  Countless rows of small, spiky hairs line the legs, the
stiff black bristles sharp and needle-like.  The legs converge at a small
body the shape of a flattened globe.  Several pairs of small, shiny black
eyes line the body, though no mouth is visible.  Slung underneath the
compact, flat body is a gelatinous bulge of baggy, leathery skin which
terminates in a limply swaying mass of glistening tentacles.  Foul
secretions drip from these tentacles, and a faint hissing sounds from the
revolting underside.

This swarthy human is roughly five and a half feet tall, neck and
forearms corded with muscle.  Deeply tan skin seems to be natural, as
opposed to a result of exposure to the sun.  Large brown eyes have a
calculating, cold air about them, as well as a less-tangible sort of hunger,
a predatorial want.  Greasy black hair has not been washed in days, and a
scraggly beard covers a face so dirty with soot it seems to be intentional.

This bulky, muscled corpse is roughly seven feet in height, though its
full size is uncertain due to the crouching position it maintains.  Clearly
long-dead, the tissue on this lich\@s frame is decaying and sagging, though
its size and power are still quite apparent.  The creature\@s milk-pale skin
is covered in a mucus-thick layer of sludge and excrement, glistening
horribly.  Glowering mindlessly through dead, milky eyes, the gape-mouthed
creature moves with frightening speed.  A shadowy chain affixed to the wall
is connected to a wide iron collar about the lich\@s neck.

pale long legged long-legged cave frog mob_6144~
a pale frog~
A pale, long-legged cave frog is here.
~
This pale frog glistens wetly, translucent skin covered in a slick of
protective slime.  Two enormous eyes, filmed over with a milky tissue,
protrude blindly from the top of its head.  Skinny front legs are tipped
with pad-like fingers, and the long, muscular legs are nearly as large as
the narrow body.  The rear legs wriggle unpleasantly whenever the frog moves
through the water, the smooth, blind undulation somehow repulsive.

a shambling corpse~
A filth-coated corpse wades unsteadily through the sludge.
~
This zombie is an abomination of whipstiched body parts and salvaged
building materials that has been fused and held together by the slime and
sewage floating within the pit.  Its limbs flail, trying to grasp at
whatever it can find in a desperate attempt to feed its own unholy
existance.  Sewage and ichor drip from the creature adding to the horrible
smell surrounding it.

A trapbot is hovering here, whistling innocently.
~
Death, be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so
For those whom thou think\@st thou dost overthrow,
Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.

From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,
Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,
And soonest our best men with thee do go,
Rest of their bones, and soul\@s delivery.

Thou art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,
And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell;
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well
And better than thy stroke; why swell\@st thou then?

One short sleep past, we wake eternally,
And death shall be no more
 Death, thou shalt die.

Razeilm hermit~
Razeilm~
The crazy hermit Razeilm stands here lost in his own delusions.
~
This shabbily dressed man has wrapped himself in many-colored rags found
on occasional sojourns outside of the sewers.  Short, emaciated, and
elderly, his ribs show prominently through the holes in his filth-ridden
rags.  A foul odor tinged with a sharper hint of a medicinal aroma surrounds
him.  His skin is encrusted with filth and dirt; clearly he has not washed
in years.  He has a distinctively feral, unbalanced look, mainly due to his
wild, darting eyes.  Shifting erratically from place to place, never
resting, the dark orbs have a fervent light of almost religious intensity. 
A wide array of scars is visible along his arms, some of them recent, many
of them seemingly self-inflicted.

The ghostly shade of Tessarin floats eerily above the ground.  Her form
is now pale and almost translucent, though she also gives off a disturbing
green-blue aura.  The shade is garbed in the robes that she had worn when
she died, and her hawk-like eyes still blaze with the energy that she must
have had in life.  Her brows are furrowed though, and her demeanor is stern,
giving her the look of a holy judge of those still upon the mortal coil.

The creature\@s milk-pale skin is covered in a mucus-thick layer of sludge
and excrement, glistening horribly.  Moving with a repulsive singularity of
purpose, the lich twitches feebly as it staggers through the sludge.

an acolyte of the Aklaju~
An acolyte of the Aklaju roams the sewer.
~
This black-clad figure is an acolyte in the Conclave of the Aklaju.  His
robes are black silk, with sinister and unholy runes embroidered along the
edges.  With his face hidden by the cowl of his robe, little can be
discerned of this sinister scholar\@s purpose.

a hulking flesh golem~
A hulking golem of dead flesh stands here, apparently lifeless.
~
This hulking mound of flesh is made from the stitched together body parts
of at least six different creatures, most likely from a wide variety of
races.  Enough alatharya pieces have been grafted onto the grisly husk,
however, to make it well over seven feet tall.  Its cold, dead eyes are
utterly immobile, but every so often its body twitches, as if some forgotten
spasm of nerve still animates its frame.

Lerinsus, an archmage of the Aklaju, stands here.
~
The black-robed figure of Lerinsus stands here, hood thrown back to a
reveal a face surprisingly young and surprisingly innnocent for a man who
has attained such a high rank in the Conclave of the Aklaju.  His eyes are a
dark brown, but devoid of any warmth or trace of the excitement of youth. 
Nothing can be discerned about his purpose here, save that he wears the
tools of his dark magic openly, prepared to use them at a moment\@s notice.

This passage through the sewer is cold and dank, with a floor of thick,
black mud.  The walls here are sturdy granite, the ancient stones mortared
together time and again over the centuries.  Numerous small pipes and drains
are poised to empty raw sewage from above, but they have all been sealed
over recently.  To the north, the sewer continues, and the air is rancid and
foul. Here, though, there is surprisingly little stench.  Instead, a faint,
almost alchemical odor is present, growing stronger to the south.

This scruffy nefortu is dirty and garbed in dingy, grubby rags.  A large
head is held hunched down at the end of a long neck, vulture-like posture
combining with suspicious, hostile eyes to give this smuggler a most
unwelcoming appearance.  Yellowed teeth protrude dully from between thin
lips, lined alng his long snout.  Large, cupped ears, thin and membraneous,
twitch and caress each sound with the particular hearing of his race. 
Strong hands are filthy, claw-tipped fingers shifting nervously.

\#Ok, I\@ll talk.  In fifth grade, I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs
and I blamed it on the dog...  When my mom sent me to the summer camp for
fat kids and then they served lunch I got nuts and I pigged out and they
kicked me out...  But the worst thing I ever done -- I mixed a pot of fake
puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my
jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like
this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa -- and then I dumped it over the side, all over
the people in the audience.  And then, this was horrible, all the people
started getting sick and throwing up all over each other.  I never felt so

An enormous rat lurks about.

This rat is almost two feet long from nose to tail-tip, its glossy black
fur and bright, beady black eyes descriptive of plentiful food. 
Yellow-orange teeth are visible in the underslung mouth, and the nose
twitches eagerly as the rat constantly scents the air.  Sharp claws, active
ears, and a long, bald tail add to the repulsive nature of the rodent.

Jissas~
A frail caladaran is here, face worn with age and care.
~
This tall caladaran is dressed in shabby, dirty robes which may have once
been a blue, but have faded to a grimy, pale grey.  A careworn face holds
milky white eyes which strain to fulfil their function as sight organs, and
his wrinkled cheeks are free of facial hair.  A tall brow features two
astonishingly bushy eyebrows of a dusty green, and an unruly shock of hair
of the same color perches atop his head.  Strong hands are showing definite
signs of aging, the bones more prominent, and a few small freckle-like spots
speckled across the backs.  A vacant smile lurks about the frail caladaran\@s
lips.

A small, dirty child plays here.

This small human child plays here quite contentedly, unconcerned with the
grime that covers his face.  Thin locks of dark hair crown his head, tangled

A small girl dressed in a dirty smock is here.

This small girl cannot be older than seven or eight.  Thin legs and arms
protrude from a ragged piece of fabric which may have been a sack some
decades earlier.  Long dark hair is combed and brushed to a glossy shine,
however, and tied up in a careful knot to keep it clean by capable hands. 
Her face is dirty, and her feet are wrapped in rags, but the child seems
healthy and happy nonetheless.

A tall caladaran stands here defiantly, his lined face blazing with fury.

This tall caladaran is dressed in shabby, dirty robes which may have once
been a blue, but have faded to a grimy, pale grey.  A careworn face shows
brown eyes which normally might be kindly, but which now blaze with
indignant fury.  His wrinkled cheeks are free of facial hair, quivering with
emotion.  A tall brow features two astonishingly bushy eyebrows of a dusty
green, and an unruly shock of hair of the same color perches atop his head. 
Strong hands are showing definite signs of aging, the bones more fragile and
prominent.  A few small freckle-like spots are speckled across the backs of
the angrily clenched hands.

This scrawny child looks to be about eleven or twelve.  He has the drawn,
unhealthy air of someone who has grown far too quickly.  Skinny arms and

baggy shirt.  His hair is a mess, but bright, active eyes peer out from a
healthy face.  The child seems happy and in good health, if a bit grimy.

small girl child mob_6233~
a small girl~
A small girl plays here, covered with dirt from head to toe.
~
This small girl cannot be older than seven or eight.  Thin legs and arms
protrude from a ragged piece of fabric which may have been a sack some
decades earlier.  Long dark hair is combed and brushed to a glossy shine,
however, and tied up in a careful knot to keep it clean by capable hands. 
Her face is dirty, and her feet are wrapped in rags, but the child seems
healthy and happy nonetheless.

turtle\@s warty, pebbly skin across the eyes and at the knees and elbows, the
subtle red tint perhaps a mating attractor.

a small grey fish~
A small, dull-grey fish swims through the murky water.
~
This small, dull-grey fish swims about, eyes pale and bulbous.  A wide,
low-slung jaw seems ideal for trawling for tiny bits of food, the scoop-like
mouth gaping stupidly.  Small, black-tipped fins and a slimy tail help it
move through the water.

An enormous rat lurks about.

This rat is almost two feet long from nose to tail-tip, its glossy black
fur and bright, beady black eyes descriptive of plentiful food. 
Yellow-orange teeth are visible in the underslung mouth, and the nose
twitches eagerly as the rat constantly scents the air.  Sharp claws, active
ears, and a long, bald tail add to the repulsive nature of the rodent.

A dark rat scrounges for food.

This sewer rat is an indistinct dark brownish black, about a foot and a
half from nose to tail-tip.  Small, rounded ears lie flat against its head,
and its dark pelt is glossily wet.  An ever-twitching nose keeps alert for
food or predators, and sharp, claw-tipped paws move with silent efficiency. 
A bald tail hovers behind for balance, long and slender.  Beady black eyes
survey the area coldly.

compact, his physique shows signs of trading power and speed for fat.  A
broken nose sits crookedly on a narrow, close face, eyes suspicious and
beady.  Ham-like hands are thick-fingered and meaty, and still seem capable
of considerable violence.

a scantily-clad aelin~
A scantily-clad aelin woman is here.
~
This aelin woman is several years past the prime of her life, yet still
dresses and carries herself as though she she were not.  Slightly singed
curls of dirty blonde hair show signs of overpressing, and her face is
rouged and powdered with a vengeance.  Heavy eyeshadow is somewhat streaked,
as is her greasy pink lip color.  Her clothes are emphatically designed to
be as revealing as possible while still nominally serving their purpose,
dirty and spotted with beer and grease.  Her form, once curvaceous, now
seems dumpy, and her once-golden wings are bedraggled and unkempt.

Sarnaccha~
A voluptuous woman dances through here.
~
This human woman is about thirty years of age, and might be considered
overweight were it not for her undeniable grace.  Curvaceous and ample, she
has milk-pale skin and exotically dark hair which seems to possess an
iridescence of its own.  A strong nose and thin brows are set in an oval
face, rouged delicately.  Full, pouting lips are often seen in a soft,
alluring smile, and her movements are amazingly fluid and smooth.

This scrawny kankoran is thin and poorly-fed, his mottled brown-and-black
coat scruffy and patchy.  In places the coarse fur has fallen out, shiny,
bald weals showing beneath.  Yellowed fangs protrude from his snout, and
grey, close-set eyes are filled with suspicion.  Triangular, slightly floppy
ears sit atop his head, listening intently.  The kankoran\@s claws are dulled
and blunted through years of use, though still seem weapons in their own

rouged, the faint tint of powder complementing her fair cheeks.  Warm, large

smile.  Luxuriant hair, a deep pine-green, tumbles over her shoulders in

Kurkhath shuddeni cloaked cowled wizard mob_6316~
Kurkhath~
A shuddeni sits at the back of the alcove, cloaked and cowled.
~
Kurkhath the Outcast is a slender shuddeni, many of his physical
attributes hidden by the voluminous folds of the concealing cloak he wears. 
Through his large cowl one may glimpse a thin, corpselike face, the pale
grey skin of his face covering over where eyes would be.  Thin lips and a
bloodless nose complete the unpleasant visage.  

Kurkhath, cast out first by his guildmaster, then the band of scholars he
formed, and finally even from the Conclave of Aklaju for his dangerously
ambitious researches, is notorious for his determined and brutal methods of
ascertaining facts about the arcane and mysterious.  Bitter and angered, he
has retired here, to brood on his situation and continue in the small ways
he can.

an ethron barmaid~
A dark-haired ethron woman tends to the bar.
~
This young ethron woman, skin a deep, forest green, is of average height
for her race.  Long, slightly-unkempt hair of a deep sable is bound back in
a simple tail.  Her garments are clearly selected to accentuate her
abundantly ample bosom and hourglass figure.  Her round face, bereft of
powder or lip color, is plain and unadorned.  Dark violet eyes, large and
warm, are slightly puffy and betray the woman\@s fatigue.  Nevertheless, this
ethron seems to have a ready smile with dazzling white teeth and full lips,
cheeks dimpling attractively.

astadlari mob_6318 priest wander wandering~
Astadlari~
Astadlari, a wandering priest of Chadraln, stands here.
~
A tall, rangy caladaran, Astadlari has the weatherbeaten look of the
lifetime pilgrim.  Rough brown skin, the texture of oak bark, has been
tanned an even deeper brown by years on the open road.  Deep-set,
intelligent eyes of a warm brown sparkle with observant energy, flanking a
strong nose.  A broad-lipped mouth is nestled in a long, magnificent beard
of white, curly hair which reaches nearly to his waist.  The crown of the
caladaran\@s head is shaved clean but for a small lock of hair, bound into a
topknot.  Long, wiry limbs and slender fingers add to the caladaran\@s
already decidedly scholary air.  A simple, faded robe of neutral grey-brown
adorns the priest\@s shoulders, and a glowing hourglass sigil marks him as a
devotee of the god Chadraln.

A drunken aelin, dressed in tattered rags, staggers around.
~
A stout aelin, his sagging belly visible through his tattered garments,
staggers around the area.  His bleary eyes gaze far off into the distance,
searching through the haze with an unfocused intensity.  He smells strongly
of unwashed sweat, and several days\@ worth of ratty dirty-blond stubble
cover his chin.

a brutish srryn~
A filthy, brutish srryn struts menacingly about.
~
A large brutish srryn dressed in filthy clothing saunters arrogantly
around.  A primitive, muscled physique and a low, flat brow speak of a
rather crude life, and his dull brown scales are spattered with sewer muck. 
Large, beady black eyes glare about menacingly, and a small tongue flickers
in and out occasionally.

A formidable woman lounges here, face made-up perfectly.

This human woman seems to be in her forties, yet her appearance is
immaculate.  A flowing silk robe clings to her form, which has aged rather
gracefully.  Her slightly-tanned skin is soft and smooth.  Her face,
highlighted with fastidious application of makeup, rouge, and mascara, is
almost intimidating in its flawless facade.  Her dark hair is tied back in a
tight bun, not a single hair out of place.

a mottled-green srryn thug~
A mottled-green thuggish srryn stands here suspiciously.
~
A human-sized, mottled-green scaled srryn stands silently here, keeping
careful watch on its surroundings through a pair of dull black eyes.  Its
snout is amass with scars, some deep and others simple cuts, and holds a
collection of sharp yellow fangs.  It appears undisturbed by the dirtied
leather armor worn about its body, and moves with quick, calculated speed
that suggests nimbleness in the strongest sense.

a nefortean priest~
A bent nefortu swathed in black tends the altar.
~
This small figure is somewhat over five feet in height, while standing. 
Bent and swayed with excessive age, his back is arched in a disfiguring
hump.  Bulbous, red-rimmed eyes are weepy and misted with time, and his
long, ugly snout crisscrossed with a network of old scars.  Blunted yellow
teeth protrude past thin lips, and his prominent ears are tattered and
nearly limp.  The priest is shrouded in layers of filmy black fabric,
masking and muffling his outline.

a Khil\@Mestahn~
(Bound) An armor plated behemoth, a Khil\@Mestahn looms here.
~
A smaller cousin of the foul Khil\@ayum race, the Khil\@Mestahn stands a
mere twelve feet in height.  Thick plates of sickly green chitin cover the
beast, its armored hide fiercely spiked.  A pair of long, plated arms extend
from its body, each ending in a set of claws more reminicent of swords than
fingers.  An impossibly wide maw hangs slightly ajar, displaying rows of
razor teeth, below a set of black, doll-like eyes.  

The Khil-Mestahn plods along slowly, heavily.  The creatures breaths are
audible-sounding as a huge bellows, each exhalation accompanied by a
dripping of viscous saliva.  The doll-like eyes flicker, and then are calm
once more.

A four-winged seraph~
Levishul, Emissary of the Ishia
~
Tall, slender and effeminately muscled; this male seraph hovers here on
four wings.  His skin tone is a deep burnished bronze, and dark eyelashes
accentuate silver eyes without pupils.  Golden tousled locks of hair spill
and curl about his shoulders, and a small and sleek, perfectly formed nose
sits above a sensuous mouth framed by a thin, well-groomed mustache and
beard.  His wings, translucent and shot through with a silver-veined
luminescence, are divided into two pairs: the pair emerging from his ribs
have a ten foot wingspan, and the pair spread from his waist have a two foot
wingspan.

Asha~
A lovely siren coated in golden down hovers on expansive black ragged wings. 
~
Slender, bronze-sheened, and sleekly muscled, this siren hovers on giant
black ragged wings.  Her hair, the colour of bronzed auburn and cropped
short, is full and feathered just the same, a careful disarray which exposes
her exquisitely formed curved ears.  The skin upon her face, neck, and bared
arms and back is smooth, the colour of burnished gold.  However, her fluted
torso, shapely thighs and calves, and her blackened clawed hands and feet
are clothed in nothing but a light fur of golden down.  

Her green eyes sparkle and glisten wetly, her nose is perky like that of a
small child\@s, her lips are full and mature, and her jaw is sharply defined,
yet at the same time softly rounded.  Her wings, shadowy black and feathered
like any aelin\@s are horridly ragged, though when unfurled have a wingspan
twice her height.

an oddly-shaped club~
An oddly-shaped club made from a chair leg is here.~
This club, made into a stylized weapon for sentimental reasons, was first
used in a bar fight by a bandit leader.  Ripping the leg from a chair in one
impressive move, he proceeded to brain his foe with the crude weapon.  Now
he has had it worked over, installed a core of strengthening metal, and
improved the grip.

club odd oddly oddly-shaped shaped chair leg~
This odd club seems to have originally been a chair leg, now polished and
worked over into a respectable weapon.  The wood has been stained and
varnished, a grip carved into the narrower end and wrapped with leather. 
The thicker end has over a dozen thick, short nails hammered into and
through it, making the striking end of the mace bristle with short spikes
and heavy, knobbly heads.

key heavy iron antique~
This heavy iron key has a large, round head, cast in the shape of a leaf
or star of some kind; the exact details have been effaced by time.  A
relatively ornate set of teeth seem made to fit a large leyhole, the teeth
themselves free of the small spots of rust which dot the rest of the key.

oaken nightstand~
Wrought of sturdy oak and solid iron fasteners, this nightstand has
clearly withstood rough handling.  Several dents and gouges pock the sides
and top, which also bears a number of dubious stains.  The side closest to
the makeshift bed is particularly worn, etched with several fingernail
marks.  Despite this, the construction seems sound; while a frailer piece of
furniture might have long ago succumbed to such ill-treatment, this specimen
bears such marks as only surface blemishes.

This crude spear is made from bits and scraps of miscellaneous household
items.  The handle is seven feet of worn, straight oak, polished by time,
that seems to have once been a broom handle.  Bits of grimy rag are wrapped
about one end for a grip, and the head is made from several steel nails,
hammered out into long, thin spikes.  Each nail is bent backwards at the
end, to make a holding sort of barb.  The spear seems to be made to catch
small animals, as the delicate prongs would be ineffectual against armor or
larger animals.

background of an ice crystal and double-imposed on the holy symbol of
Jolinn.  The colors have all but faded, now, and the embroidery is nearly
gone.  The once-thick broadcloath has worn to a limp, soft rag, and any

lenses commonly used by jewelers and armorers.  The metal is pitted from
long immersion in water, though the glasses have been cleaned lovingly.  The
lenses, long gone, were held in place by a thin rim on the outside of the
frames.  Bent in places, the damage suggests that the lenses were broken or
removed before the exposure to whichever corrosive substance ate at the
metal.  These frames have since been adopted by a child as a plaything,
months and months of inexpert, eager cleaning showing clearly on the

crushed Uthlin siltshells and permanenced by the juice of pressed fenweed,
the brilliant silk strip is a castoff scrap from the bottom of a robe or

materials gathered from a sewer, the crown is spotted with bits of mold that
speak of constant humidity.  The greenish silt-rich mud, soaked into the
spongy paper, has been taken from the bottom of a submerged channel.  The
orangeish mud bears crumbs and tiny chips of old brick, of the type used in
Earendam\@s construction, and the yellowish clay comes from a vein of soil
rich with ochre.  The soot comes from pine torches, carefully daubed onto
the paper with a small finger.

This small notebook is a few inches tall, and half again as wide.  Made
from a few small pages of thin, cheap foolscap bound between two pieces of
thick pasteboard, it seems a students\@ memo book.  The cover, once a bright
green, has faded to a wan seafoam, tattered and beginning to mold slightly
from excessive exposure to damp.  There are twelve pages of the thin, beaten
paper.  {rYou may \@read book #\@ or \@write book # <line>\@.{n

This small piece of thin, beaten paper has been torn from a small book of
some sort.  Crumpled slightly, the paper has several notes scribbled upon it
in thick pencil marks:

17 Lyc - Still stuck on duty here.  Some shuddeni
came poking through, and I somehow forgot to warn
him off.  The screams stopped pretty fast.

 *a small doodle adorns the margin here*

4th Sun - Craving mousse.  Must get invited to ano-
ther of those parties.

7 Sun - Hm, is this too informal for a vigil-log?  
I don\@t think the guild would find it dignified.

a gleaming white surcoat~
A gleaming white surcoat lies in a silken pile.~
A rather ornate piece of work, this surcoat is made from fine Jh\@ten
silk, the particular knotting of the gold braid which trims the collar and
embroidery revealing it to have been made by someone with nautical training.
Emblazoned with the sunburst of the Light and the pegasus of Rystaia, the
surcoat seems a family heirloom, most likely of the ethron Thrugani
clanholt.

a large clay drinking-bowl~
A large, crude clay drinking bowl filled with cheap wine is here.~
This cheap wine is a thick yellow, sweetened with sugar and tinctured
with lead.  The syrupy, strong-smelling alcohol is held in a primitive
earthenware bowl made from the reddish-orange clay found almost exclusively
beneath Earendam.

a billowy, sheer skirt of red silk~
A billowy red silk skirt lies in a fluid pile here.~
This bangled silk dress is flared and stitched so as to flare and move in
a certain manner, most likely used by a dancer.  The frayed lower hem speaks
of long use.  A row of bangles across the top is also indicative of use for
entertainment, as does the flimsy, thin fabric.  The wearer apparently spent
much time in the presence of pine torches, the smoky scent tangible around
the dress.

a wide, flat drum~
A wide hoop of flat wood is here, covered with a tightly stretched hide.~
The hoop of wood which forms the rim of this drum is made from mountain
ash, flexible yet strong.  Griffin hide, slightly more brittle than normal
leather, has been wetted, stretched taut over the hoop, and allowed to dry. 
A unique varnish of Karacha turpentine has been used to seal and polish the
hide and wood of the instrument, giving it a peculiar and distinct
resonance.  

Painted on the surface of the drum is the central form from the Eye of
Xthjich.  Dyed in magic-neutral materials, the Eye is incomplete, the edges
of the pentagram not included in the rendition.  One of the elder demon
symbols, this version of the Eye is crude and yet designed to channel none
of the potency of the evil.

a calcified femur~
A large leg bone lies here, surface glassy and hardened.~
This bone seems to be from a large saurian, judging by the shape,
thickness, and the vein-holes\@ spacing.  The yellowed bone has been
reinforced by slow, steady exposure to a calcaereous solution, essentially
petrifying the bone into a near rock-like state, though significantly
lighter.

This large femur, yellowed and aged, has apparently been glazed and

eye lizard lizard~
This small eye, the external scala a pale pink, has been pickled in
pungent, acrid brine.  A dark pupil opens in the front, and a small stem of
bloody nerves pokes from the back.

a tight pair of silken pantaloons~
A smooth pair of black silken pantaloons lie here.~
Cheaply made from mediocre Harrudim silk, these pantaloons have been worn
by someone in decent shape, judging by the relative wear yet lack of
stretching.  Sewn together poorly, the pantaloons appear as though they
would eventually become uncomfortable.

a beaded belt of gleaming shells~
A fine steel chain lies here, strung with beads and gleaming shells.~
Made from Gaald steel and twisted in the particular style of that western
town, the links of this belt are slightly corroded, apparently from some
time spent under the sea.  The shells are a common breed of Lidreau scallop,
varnished to a high sheen with melted sand.  Round, bulbous beads, also made
from the same crude sandy glass, adorn the links of the belt.  Ranging from
a soft amber to a pale gold, the beads apparently are tinted with a solution
of niger in the glass.

belt bead beaded gleaming shell shells beads fine steel chain~
This simple belt is made from a chain of well-wrought steel links.  Each
link is decorated with beads in a range of pastel amber and gold glass.  A
plain clasp-style buckle sits on the front.  Dozens of uniform, scalloped
shells, a creamy white, have been varnished to a fine gleam.

A large, squishy pill lies here, transparent and red.~
A type of odd gel-pill made from the eggs of the crimson turtle, this
pill is imported from a desert area.  The scaliness of the exterior membrane
reveals that the pill has likely been exposed for longer than the
recommended shelf life, and may have some small ill effects.

This small stuffed doll is crudely made from brown terrycloth rags,

clearly taken their toll on the toy, the stuffing limp and thin, and the
material worn and dirtied with filth.  A sad button eye is made all the more
pathetic by the absence of its twin, and the small embroidered nose is

blotchy lettering, as from a cheap woodcut press:

Saeldar\@s skin lightly. He shrugged it away with a roll of
his muscular shoulders. \#Tarry a while,\# she whispered, her
breath smelling of roses, \#You may be healed from your fall
but that does not mean your body doesn\@t need my minstrations.\#
He snorted and wheeled like an angry bull. \#Waste not your
poison words on me, Visierra for my heart is promised to another!\#
\#She is already the Baron\@s\# the slender woman purred, eyes

a large, heavy gilt bow~
A tall, heavy bow lies here, the wood painted with gold leaf.~
This bow seems to have been made by divine hands, so perfect is the
craftsmanship.  The cord of shining gold appears for all intents and
purposes to be solid, pure gold, yet retains the properties of the best
waxed bowstring.  The wood is strong, stiffly flexible.

bow large heavy gilt painted gold~
This thick, heavy bow is carved from strong yew.  Expertly planed and
sanded, it has a slight, curving redoubt at each end.  A length of shining
gold cord has been affixed to the bent piece of wood, one end looped for
easy unstringing.  The wood has been painted with bright gold leaf, and
varnished to a bright gleam.  Leather wraps the hand-grip, with tiny black
lines painted above and below to help calculate elevation and angle.  

A circle of soft, pure gold has been stamped into the wood just above the
elevation-marks.

A Close, Round Tunnel~
This round tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, walled with crumbling,
dull-orange brick so eroded and crumbled with age that it seems a miracle
the tunnel is still clear.  Coated with a layer of transparent slime, the
tunnel descends into knee-deep water of a sickly greenish-grey color to the
south, and continues up a slight gradient to the west.  The air here is
humid, dank, and still, and seems quite flat and stale.  Thick with the reek
of sewage, the tunnel is dark and close.  One particularly intact brick in
the northern wall has been drawn upon with greasy charcoal.

brick intact north charcoal greasy~
This orange-brown brick has been wiped clean, and on it is detailed a
miniature drawing of a crude black dragon, toothy mouth gaping.  A small gem
is drawn falling from its bottom amidst fecal matter.  A small arrow links
the word \#Vaialos\# to the gem, though the lettering at the end becomes
almost too shaky to read, as if the author had been seized by a fit of
laughter while writing.

This round tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, walled with crumbling,
dull-orange brick so eroded and crumbled with age that it seems a miracle
the tunnel is still clear.  Coated with a layer of transparent slime, the
tunnel climbs slightly to the west, and descends down a gentle slope

decrepit tunnels, and the footing underneath seems shifty and uncertain in

A Damp Brick Passage~
This narrow, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage. 
Stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe humidity.  Dully-glazed brown
brick presses in on all sides, the sweating masonry sticky with the grime of
decade upon decade.  A rough floor of irregular stone makes footing
uncertain in the near-darkness.  Cobwebs dangle and float, ghostlike and
pale, moved by the barest hint of an undetectable draft.  A low wooden door
stands in the southern wall, swollen and slimy with damp.  The passage
terminates to the north, a rickety wooden ladder leading down into a square
of blackness.  The smell from the level below is colder and more earthy, an
older smell than the warm reek of rotting sewage from the south, though by
no means free of the distinctive source of excrement.

blocked by a pair of metal doors, painted a drab grey, which slide from the

large lever small bar~
This large brass lever consists of an H-shaped shaft which protrudes the
wall.  Above it is a small strip of clean, shiny brass with a slot running
the length of the piece.  Many small notches run along this slit at regular
intervals, apparently demarcations for the red enameled arrow which seems
designed to slide back and forth along the slot.  

The apparatus is apparently broken - the doors and wall have several
scrawled symbols marked on them in a faintly luminescent orange paint, and
the lever is loose and offers no resistance.

A Large Sewer Tunnel~
This large tunnel branches off from the main network of sewer
passageways.  The walls of the tunnel are rougher, in many places nothing
but mud, and appear to be of an older construction than the tunnels to the
north.  While the foul miasma of the sewers still persists here, it is
obvious that these tunnels have not been used for many years.  The filthy
water covers the floor here, stagnant, though the old watermarks on the
sides show that these tunnels were once far more active.  Occasional pieces
of debris and garbage can still be seen floating within the brownish waters.
To the south this branch tunnel continues, while to the north the tunnel
climbs a steady incline.

An Ominous Tunnel~
This rough, brick-walled tunnel is much smaller than the tunnel to the
west.  Seemingly half-finished, the brickwork stops abruptly, giving way to
packed dirt and natural stone.  The darkness and closeness of the tunnel
seem oppressive, dampening light.  Sibilant hisses and ominous murmurs rasp
through the tunnel in a low, constant ambience.  To the east a sickly green
wall formed of a pale, swirling mist fills the tunnel.  From the wall one
hears far louder, more distinct voices and mutters which form a strange
harmony with ambient rumblings.  While the sounds emanating from the wall
are unintelligible, they possess a distinct air of anger, hate, and mournful
longing.

The Lair of the Hermit~
The small tunnel comes to an end here as the digging of the tunnel had
stopped here long ago.  Now it is apparent that this part of the tunnel has
been converted into someone\@s home.  A small, rickety, wooden table stands
at the center of the room with a variety of items upon it.  All around the
rooms various niches have been carved from the stone walls and seemingly
useless junk are present within each niche.  A few strings of mushrooms are
strung around the room, drying and a pile of refuse lies in the corner.  A
small peat fire burns a distance away from the table, adding its stench and
smoke to the air.  Finally you also see a small pallet, constructed almost
entirely from what looks like discarded rags and mildewed clothing, tucked
into another corner.  To the west the sickly green wall still emits a
disturbing sound that fills the chamber.

This smaller tunnel runs perpendicular with the large tunnel to the east
and comes to a dead-end here.  The walls of the tunnel are rough, and appear
to be of an older construction than the tunnels that make up the majority of
the sewers.  Towards the end of the tunnel, where the sewer water no longer
reaches, a stone trapdoor is hidden underneath a layer of filth.  While the
foul miasma of the sewers still persists here, it is obvious that these

The End of a Tunnel~
This smaller tunnel runs perpendicular with the large tunnel to the west
and comes to an end here.  The walls of the tunnel are rough, and appear to
be of an older construction than the tunnels that make up the majority of
the sewers.  A small niche has been chiseled out of the wall towards the
bottom corner of the end of the tunnel.  While the foul miasma of the sewers
still persists here, it is obvious that these tunnels have not been used for
many years.  The water level here is low and stagnant, though the old
watermarks on the sides show that these tunnels were once far more active.

Before the Pit~
Here in the tunnel some rubble has dammed much of the water, causing most
of the stagnant water to pool at the northern end, away from the very end of
the tunnel which descends into the pit beneath.  The walls of the tunnel are
rougher, and appear to be of an older construction than the tunnels to the
north, as well as being caked with a large residue of filth.  While the foul
miasma of the sewers still persists here, it is obvious that these tunnels
have not been used for many years.  A rusty steel ladder leads down into the
pit as the space opens up to the south into a cavelike pool of sludge and
body parts.  The smell is horrendous, rotting flesh and excrement reeking in
the humid, chill air.

Within the Pit~
This cave-like pit is over thirty feet deep, and is fairly wide.  Scooped
from the muddy earth, the round hollow\@s original purpose is undiscernable. 
However, it is readily apparent that it has been used for quite some time as
a corpse disposal ground.  A pungent odor of rotting flesh, sickly-sweet,
mixed with the powerful scent of raw sewage and excrement, fills the air
with its humid reek.  The putrescent mix of sludge is several feet deep, the
footing uncertain.  Dismembered body parts float in the muck, along with
bits of less identifiable tissue.  The sewage is thick and opaque, a muddy
swill which speaks of more unpleasant things hidden beneath the surface. 
The hollow beneath the earth continues to the south and east, and a rusty
metal ladder climbs out of the pit to an open tunnel above.

Above a Yawning Subterranean Chamber~
This large cave-like chamber appears to have been created by a sinkhole
of some sort.  More than forty feet tall in some places, the roof is formed
by several large slabs of stone which seem to have wedged against one
another, blank and immobile.  Its walls are ragged, chalky limestone, with
sharp edges angling downward along each wall.  Below, a pool of cloudy,
foul-smelling covers the muddy floor.  Several scratch marks are evident in
the soft stone walls, each long set of gouges grouped in fours.  The air
here is uneasily still and stale, heavy with the reek of rot and damp. 
Below, a small gap in the southern wall leads from the chamber.

A Walled-Off Nook~
This small nook is recessed into the wall of the pit.  The ceiling of the
nook is fairly low, and though the recess is not very large it is just
adequate enough for several people to fit tightly in together.  The pungent
smell from the pit to the south still is present in the air here.  The floor
of the room here is rough dirt, as if there was no effort or time put into
completing this part.  The slimy mud walls of the nook bear the graffiti of
sprayed blood smears, as well as what appear to be some rough, scrawled
writing.  The low dirt ceiling opens up slightly to the south, where the
oddly-shadowed opening of the nook winds around an odd curve in the pit
wall.

rough scrawled writing~

graffiti blood smear smears sprayed~
The walls here are slashed with dull red sprays of coagulated blood, old
and gelatinous with time.  Though the blood has been here for quite some
time, the oppressive humidity has made it simply clump and darken.  The
configuration of the sprays are such that someone or something must have
been slashed to ribbons with unbelieveable force, or that rather heavy
arterial bleeding was left untended.

A Secret Chamber~
This chamber has been specially prepared in order to suit both the
environment it is in and the needs of the original builders.  The roof of
the chamber has been waterproofed in order to prevent any seeping from the
sewage above.  The chamber appears to have been constructed in order to keep
it soundproof and hidden from any potential seekers.  The walls of the
chamber itself look to have been originally stone, but now a dark, glassy,
substance covers much of them.  The chamber itself is devoid of any relevant
furniture other than a simple chest that stands by an upright mirror in the
back of the room.  The only apparent exit is the trapdoor above.

The Top of a Dark Stairwell~
A carved staircase spirals downward from here through this tall
stairwell, heading down into darkness.  The black stone walls of the room
are covered with decades\@ worth of grit and grime.  The air is dank and
cloying, but oddly seems less foul when it wafts up from below.  The grime,
stench, and the sounds of trickling water all point to the nearby sewer, but
this place has no pipes or drain, and is oddly dry.  The northern wall is
made from ancient brick, the crumbling masonry coated with thick, limey
deposits.

End of a Sewer Passage~
This chamber marks the end of a passage through the sewers.  Dank, filthy
water drips from innumerable crevices overhead, coagulating in turgid pools
underfoot.  The walls bulge into a semi-circle here, with most of the
original sewer architecture hidden behind thick lime.  On one side of the
room, bricks and mortar are visible, albeit smeared with filth.  The water
here not caught in pools drains slowly to the east, where the sewer passage
begins and slopes gently downward.

A constant drizzle of brown, brackish water falls from overhead into this
crude passage through the sewers.  The pungent, ripe odor of sewage clings
to everything here, from the crude walls smeared with filth to the floor,
which is caked with untold years of grime and offal.  A rusty iron chute
opens in the ceiling, leading upwards and out of the passage through a
narrow pipe.  A thin trickle of water creeps through the middle of the
sewer, which extends in either direction out of sight into the darkness.

A Junction in the Sewer~
Several sewer tunnels come together here from various directions.  The
walls here are solid bricks, but not old enough to be from the centuries ago
when this place was originally constructed.  Its more recent age, however,
does not protect this tunnel from the ravages of use.  The air is dank and
septic, and encrusted limestone forms numerous stalagmites overhead. 
Underfoot, tainted water collects in turgid pools, occasionally brimming
over to make the entire passage muddy.  

There is a disquieting feel about this room, and you find it difficult to
discern one direction from another the longer you remain.  This feeling is
most intense by a wall, where a patch of filth has been wiped aside and a
sinister rune has been emblazoned.

Overlooking a Huge Drain~
A sewer passage comes to an end here, terminating in a semi-circular
grate in the eastern wall.  About a half-foot wide, the grate is too small
to allow much larger than a rat through, but above it is an iron hatch,
which opens eastward onto a huge drain, which runs perpendicular to this
passage.  A steady trickle of filthy water flows through here, falling
through the grate and into the drain, where it joins a torrent of other
sewage.  Through the grate, you can make out a ladder on the other side of
the hatch, no doubt allowing a trip to the bottom of the drain.

A Passage through the Sewer~
This passage through the sewer is cold and dank, with a floor of thick,
black mud.  The walls here are sturdy granite, the ancient stones mortared
together time and again over the centuries.  Numerous small pipes and drains
are poised to empty raw sewage from above, but they have all been sealed
over recently.  To the north, the sewer continues, and the air is rancid and
foul. Here, though, there is surprisingly little stench.  Instead, a faint,
almost alchemical odor is present, growing stronger to the south.

in nature.

A Three-Way Junction in the Sewer~
Three sewer passages come together here, forming a three-way junction. 
The dank chill of the sewer is more noticeable here, as a cold draft brings
septic air from the depths.  Overhead, traces of the original stone masonry
of the sewer are visible in the arches supporting the intersecting tunnels. 
The walls are covered with thick mold and filth, while the floor is dotted
with brackish pools of filthy water.  Towards the south, the ground grows
muddier still, and slopes downward.  In the other direction, the sewer
continues into the darkness.

The Altar of the Aklaju~
A massive altar of black stone sits squarely in the center of this
chamber. Once a sewer chamber, this place has been converted into a place
of diabolic mystical focus.  The walls are clearly made from the bricks of
the old sewer, but they have been meticulously cleaned and inscribed with a
multitude of sinister runes.  Underfoot, solid blocks of granite have been
set over the muddy floor, then warded with some magic to repel water from
welling up.  Curiously, the all-pervasive strench of the sewers is very
faint here, replaced by an acrid, alchemical odor.  Illuminating the room
are braziers of smoldering coals, placed strategically to keep the altar
shadowed. There are exits in all four directions from this place, but of note
is the sturdy iron portcullis which blocks travel to the east.

massive altar black stone~
This large altar, crafted from polished granite and faced with gleaming
onyx, has been kept almost surgically clean.  Nearly six feet wide and half
as tall, the altar has an ominously coffinlike air to it.
~
E
braziers~
These nondescript braziers are made from round bowls of dark iron set in
three-legged stands of the same metal, bolted to the floor.  Some oily bits
of what seem to be coal burn within, filling the room with smoky yellow
light.  
~
E
rune runes~
Runes seem to be everywhere in the room.  Runes of strength and
concealment are used with almost decorative liberty about the walls and
ceiling, and a swirling line of runes about the base of the walls seems to
keep away the damp.  A minor rune of the void is chiselled into the wall
above the altar, showing the devotion to the dark gods.  Even the braziers
each have a small rune on the side, maintaining the constant flame.

A Charnal Room~
Judging from the ancient pipes and drains, this room was once a part of a
sewer.  This place\@s current function is not entirely dissimilar, as it is
devoted to the disposal of the dead.  Little care has been given to the
dignity of the dead, for numerous bodies have been mangled and strewn about
the room.  In the center of the chamber is a ring of black stones, each
inscribed with a rune.  Within the interior of the circle is a pool of pure
darkness, which crackles with some sinister mystical energy.  The room is
oddly free of the reek of both the sewer and the charnal house it has
become.  A likely explanation are two braziers, burning coals and some sort
of incense to produce both light and an acerbic, alchemical odor.  The only
exit is through an archway to the east.

dead body bodies~
The bodies here are mostly dismembered, and seem to be loosely organized
by type.  Only one body remains intact, apparently having suffered
vivisection.  Skin, muscle, and organs are systematically peeled away layer
by layer in some horrific mockery of a butterfly.  The eyes have been
removed, and the tongue hangs out of a slit in the bottom of the slack jaw
like an obscene trap door.  

The majority of the gore and blood in the room seems centered on the pool of
darkness, as though many leaking and bleeding pieces had been dragged or
carried to it.

These nondescript braziers are made from round bowls of dark iron set in
three-legged stands of the same metal, bolted to the floor.  Some oily bits

Storage Room~
This place was once a sewer tunnel, but has recently been converted to a
storage room of some kind.  Fresh hay has been tossed on the muddy floor,
and any openings in the roof have been meticulously sealed to prevent water
from leaking on anything here.  A scrollcase stands flush with the north
wall, while a rack for holding wands and staves stands to the south.  A
sturdy metal trunk is bolted on the floor, sealed with a sturdy lock but
also carved with several large runes.  To the west is a thick wooden door,
and affixed to the wall next to it is an iron lever.

rack wands staves~
This horizontal rack takes up most of the southern wall, a framework of

The rack is empty.
~
E
sturdy metal trunk several large runes~
This large metal trunk is over eight feet wide and three high, secured to
the floor with massive bolts.  Covered with runes of binding and protection,
the dull black iron is dauntingly immobile, as if daring you to even -try-
opening it.  An equally massive lock has been fitted into the front of the
chest, the sheer intricacy of the keyhole alone stymieing any attempts at
manipulating the workings and tumblers within.

The Portal Chamber~
Once a tunnel in the sewer, this place has been restored and converted
into a habitable chamber.  The walls are scrubbed clean, and any place where
water might drain here has been plugged or mortared over.  Covering the
muddy floor are ornate tiles, each carved with a different runic image. 
Dominating the room, though, is a square archway made of ornate black stone.
The archway is freestanding, and clearly designed for some arcane purpose,
for a flickering black portal shimmers within.  The only mundane exit from
the room lies to the north.

Overlooking a Huge Drain~
A sewer passage comes to an end here, terminating in a semi-circular
grate set in the eastern wall.  About a half-foot wide, the grate is too
small to allow much larger than a rat through, but visible beyond it is a
huge drain, running perpendicular to this passage.  A steady trickle of
filthy water flows through here, falling through the grate and into the
drain, where it joins a torrent of other sewage as it flows southward.

This winding, muddy passage twists its way from the north and then down
into the depths of the sewers.  Filthy, brackish water is ankle deep for
most of the passage, and what floor remains uncovered is thick black mud. 
The water follows the course of the passage downward, with the miasma of the
sewer growing with every step.

A Decaying Sewer~
Filth and grime stain the corroded metal walls of this pipe under the
city.  Ancient and flaking away in rusty shingles, the metal is almost
spongy in places.  Six feet in diameter, the conduit is coated in a layer of
mud and muck.  Thin trickles of putrid water issue from the smaller pipes
which empty into the tunnel, filling a large, fetid pool.  Unable to flow
anywhere, the waste has accumulated nearly a foot deep in this slanting
section of pipe.  The foul stench of raw sewage and decay clogs the air, and
the faint sounds of dripping water echo against the tunnel walls.  The older
pipe leads to an intersection to the east.  The western end is completely
blocked by a collapsed section of the thoroughly rusted pipe; decayed metal,
dirt, and a few bricks obstruct any passage to the west.

A Small, Cubical Room~
This small, cubical room is roughly eight feet to a side, the dully-
glazed brick filthy with accumulation of crusty, dried waste.  The floor is
covered by nearly a foot of reeking, gloppy sewage, some of which flows
thickly out through the conduit to the west.  The pool of muck is fed by a
brick-lined passage to the north, and a round pipe to the south.  Many
smaller tubes and pipes also contribute to the stench, streaking the walls
with excrement.  The air is dank and humid, chokingly thick with the stink
of the murk.

fading into the distance.  Many smaller pipes feed into this one at regular
intervals, streaked stains of grime beneath the openings.  The humid air is
cool, though thick with the reek of raw sewage.  The pipe flows southward,

A Filth Pit~
This round pit is walled in what might be brick; with the incredible
amounts of exrescence coating the wall and floor, it is impossible to tell. 
The filth is several feet deep here, a muddy, thick sludge of the waste of
hundreds of citizens mixed with old food, animal droppings, and other
unmentionables.  Whether this was a planned refuse pit or merely a severely
clogged access shaft is unclear; either way, the stench is incredible.  The
shaft tapers slightly overhead, narrowing to a manhole-sized opening at the
top of a ladder which crawls its laborious way out of the muck and up the
side of the shaft.

A Warm, Dry Lair~
The cold, wet sewer tunnel turns slightly upwards here, and dead-ends in
a small alcove.  The stone here is decidedly less filthy than other
sections, and the walls and floor show concerted efforts of some manner of
cleaning.  The ceiling above is formed to be of laid granite blocks - this
alcove seems to crouch directly under the foundation of one of the
buildings.  Old, torn blankets are gathered in lumpy piles on the floor,
each appearing to have been used recently as a bed.  A small set of shelves
lean drunkenly in one corner.  The air is somehow warmer here, perhaps due
to the gurgling pipe which snakes across the ceiling and disappears up into
the foundation.  The walls are kept almost entirely free of damp, care taken
to securely plug any chinks or holes in the stone.  A pair of smoking
torches have been affixed to the walls here, filling the area with
tempermental yellow light.

The End of a Narrow Sewer~
Filth and grime stain the rough grey stone walls of this tunnel under
the city.  Though tall enough for an alatharyan, the passage beneath the
streets is quite narrow.  A thick layer of mud and muck covers the floor,
forming small pools before meandering through the accumulated waste towards
the circular chute which lies in the center of the room.  A rusty iron
ladder extends downward through the chute, leading down into the darkness
below.  Thin trickles of putrid water issue from the smaller pipes which
empty into the tunnel, forming fetid pools amidst the mud.  The foul stench
of raw sewage and decay clogs the air, and the faint sounds of dripping
water echo against the tunnel walls.  The tunnel comes to an end here,
though it continues to the east, from whence a steady stream of water seems

A Muddy Sewer Intersection~
Filth and grime stain the walls of this tunnel under the city.  The
accumulated excrement covers the walls, the pasty, muddy waste almost
entirely obscuring the rough grey stone blocks beneath.  Though tall enough
for an alatharyan, the passage beneath the streets is quite narrow.  A thick
layer of mud and muck covers the floor, mixing with the sewage and waste of
hundreds of citizens.  Thin trickles of putrid water issue from the smaller
pipes which empty into the tunnel, forming fetid pools amidst the mud.  The
foul stench of raw sewage and decay clogs the air, and the faint sounds of
dripping water echo against the tunnel walls.  The tunnel turns here,
continuing through the gloom to the north and east, while a shorter side
passage snakes its way south.

A Filthy Tunnel~
Thick layers of muck and grime coat the walls of this rough stone tunnel.
In the floor beneath you, a thin, cramped pipe leads down a sharp incline
into a mud-encrusted chute.  The sides of the pipe are slick with streaked
filth, leading down into the bowels of the sewers.  The rich scents of
sewage and decay clog the air, and the faint sounds of dripping water echo
against the walls of the tunnel.  To the north, tunnel continues into
darkness.  A mixture of mud and slime has congealed on the floor of the
tunnel, oozing slowly along the pipe in one semisolid mass.

North End of Catwalk~
The filth- and grime-stained rough stone walls of this tunnel open here
into one of the city\@s main drains.  The thick flow of putrid sludge flows
out through the sewer from the west spatters down into the drain below.  Mud
and slime are even thicker on the walls of the drain, and the strong stench
of sewage and rot thickens the humid air.  The sounds of falling water drift
up from below, punctuated by drips and and wet splashes.  A thin iron
catwalk is bolted to the side of the drain, heading south over the tunnel
which the drain feeds into.  To the east, a round pipe of the same diameter
stretches into darkness, a small, steady stream of filth dribbling down to
the drain below.  An iron ladder leads down through a hole in the catwalk,
the rungs so encrusted with excrement as to be difficult to see.

A Rusty Catwalk Above a Conduit~
This catwalk passes north and south over a large conduit which receives
all of the waste for the entire city quadrant.  Covered in rust and slime,
the iron catwalk seems ready to pull away from the wall at any moment, so
corroded is the ancient framework.  There is no way down into the conduit
below here, except by jumping.  The wall of the drain is coated with mud and
grime, and glutinous trickles of putrid muck flow down the walls from the
smaller pipes and channels which empty into the drain.  Many larger pipes
also empty out into this overflow, close-barred grates covering the
apertures.  The strong stench of sewage and rot hangs heavy in the humid
air, and the sound of gurgling sewage filters up to you.

seems to ooze from every gap, and which becomes even thicker to the east.  A
wide runnel is flanked by two narrow stone walkways, filled with several
inches of scummy, gloopy waste.  Smaller grooves emerge from the walls to

Stacks of boxes and broken crates line the rough stone walls of this

been cleaned and converted into some sort of living space.  The pipes have
been tightly plugged by small cloth-wrapped casks hammered into the
openings, blocking the inflow of sewage.  A long, almost coffinlike, box
lined with dirty straw lies against one wall, a man-shaped depression
nestled into the straw from long use.  A battered iron stove, cobbled
together with scraps of pipe and beaten tin, stands in a corner.  Unwashed
rags of clothing and other detritus of residence lies scattered about the
ground.  The scent of rot and raw sewage lingers heavily in the room, mixed
with the smell of wet animals and the subtle, coppery tang of blood.  A
small doorway leads east into a narrow passage.  The floor is relatively
clean, sand and bits of sawdust strewn about to absorb moisture.

A Series of Clay-Walled Passages~
This narrow, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage and the
earthy smell of wet mud.  Stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe
humidity.  Sticky yellow clay covers every surface thickly, the earth
glistening wet.  The tunnel begins to curve erratically, splitting and
rejoining itself apparently at random.  Smaller passages and tunnels sprout
with no direction or order, narrow holes of varying depth and width boring
off into the walls and ceiling.  A shallow runnel follows along, clogged
with a mixture of foul sewage and muddy clay.  Glutinous scum oozes from the
clay at various points, slipping down the slick walls and mingling with the
gloppy mass which covers the floor.

A Series of Clay-Walled Passages~
This narrow, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage and the
earthy smell of wet mud.  Stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe
humidity.  Sticky yellow clay covers every surface thickly, the earth
glistening wet.  The tunnel begins to curve erratically, splitting and
rejoining itself apparently at random.  Smaller passages and tunnels sprout
with no direction or order, narrow holes of varying depth and width boring
off into the walls and ceiling.  A shallow runnel follows along, clogged
with a mixture of foul sewage and muddy clay.  Glutinous scum oozes from the
clay at various points, slipping down the slick walls and mingling with the
gloppy mass which covers the floor.

An Overflow Pipe~
This round tunnel is about nine feet in diameter, the mostly smooth walls
a slightly reflective grey; however, as they are coated with a crust of
muck, whether the tunnel is crafted of metal or stone is uncertain.  Two
narrow walkways, each about a foot and a half wide, abut the curvature of
the walls roughly three feet from the bottom of the pipe.  Flanked by these
curbs is a broad, deep channel, designed to deal with vast amounts of water
in the event of an overflow in the sewers.  The few scummy inches of thick,
glutinous waste in the bottom of the channel emits a horrific stench, moving
slowly down the east-to-west gradient.  Smaller pipes join the larger at
regular intervals, the walls even more stained from the constant trickling
outflow.  The tunnel vanishes into darkness in either direction, the air
humid and rank.

An Overflow Pipe~
This round tunnel is about nine feet in diameter, the mostly smooth walls
a slightly reflective grey however, as they are coated with a crust of muck,
whether the tunnel is crafted of metal or stone is uncertain.  Two narrow
walkways, each about a foot and a half wide, abut the curvature of the walls
roughly three feet from the bottom of the pipe.  Flanked by these curbs is a
broad, deep channel, designed to deal with vast amounts of water in the
event of an overflow in the sewers.  The few scummy inches of thick,
glutinous waste in the bottom of the channel emits a horrific stench, moving
slowly down the east-to-west gradient.  Smaller pipes join the larger at
regular intervals, the walls even more stained from the constant trickling
outflow.  The tunnel vanishes into darkness in either direction, the air
humid and rank.

The Bottom of an Overflow Conduit~
This large conduit receives all of the waste for the entire city
quadrant.  Covered in rust and slime, the iron catwalk overhead seems ready
to pull away from the wall at any moment.  The wall of the drain is coated
with mud and grime, and glutinous trickles of putrid muck flow down the
walls from the smaller pipes and channels which empty into the drain.  Many
larger pipes also empty out into this overflow, close-barred grates covering
the apertures.  Two significantly larger pipes above are unbarred, however,
and from these two pour large twin streams of muck which fall through a
feeble fitration grate before splashing into the channel.  The waste is
several feet deep at the bottom of the conduit, though only a few inches at
the edges.  The strong stench of filth and rot hangs heavy in the humid air,
and the sound of gurgling sewage is all around you.  High above, a vaulted
stone ceiling is murkily visible in the wretchedly smelly dark.

A Descending, Muddy Passage~
This large tunnel runs in a steady decline to the south.  The walls of
the tunnel in many places nothing but mud, and appear to be of an older
construction than the tunnels to the north.  While the foul miasma of the
sewers still persists here, it is obvious that these tunnels have not been
used for many years.  The filthy water covers the floor here, stagnant,
though the old watermarks on the sides show that these tunnels were once far
more active.  Occasional pieces of debris and garbage can still be seen
floating within the brownish waters.  To the south this branch tunnel
continues, while to the north the tunnel climbs a steady incline.

This narrow, tiny passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage and the
earthy smell of wet mud.  Incredibly cramped, sticky yellow clay presses in
all around you.  A tiny crevice yawns in the western wall.  Patches of rough
stone show through in places, the grey stone bare and unremarkable.  A
shallow runnel follows along, clogged with a mixture of foul sewage and
muddy clay.  The runnel flows down into a small, square hole, splashing into
an ancient metal chute.  Glutinous scum oozes from the clay at various
points, slipping down the slick walls and mingling with the gloppy mass
which covers the floor.

Filth and grime stain the corroded metal walls of this pipe under the
city.  Ancient and flaking away in rusty shingles, the metal is almost
spongy in places.  Five feet in diameter, the conduit is coated in a layer
of mud and muck.  Thin trickles of putrid water issue from the smaller pipes
which empty into the tunnel, forming fetid pools amidst the waste.  The foul
stench of raw sewage and decay clogs the air, and the faint sounds of
dripping water echo against the tunnel walls.  The ancient pipe joins with a
larger conduit to the north, and wends its way south, zigzagging slightly
down a gentle decline.

A Crumbling Brick Tunnel~
This round tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, walled with crumbling,
dull-orange brick so eroded and crumbled with age that it seems a miracle
the tunnel is still clear.  Coated with a layer of transparent slime, the
tunnel climbs slightly to the west, where it narrows into an equally
corroded metal conduit.  The conduit curves sharply upwards, with several
inset handholds allowing passage up through the pipe.  Eastwards, it
descends down a gentle slope eastward before vanishing into blackness.  The
air here is humid, dank, and still, and seems to grow rather flat and stale
as the tunnel descends.  Thick with the reek of sewage, the tunnel is dark
and close.  Sounds of dripping water echo dully through the decrepit
tunnels, and the footing underneath seems shifty and uncertain in the thick
muck.

A Vaulted Stone Tunnel~
This tall, vaulted stone tunnel ends at the western extreme with a
massive, close-barred iron grate.  The metal is encrusted with grime and
muck, and a small hinged section of the bars allows passage through. 
Through the grate, a filthy room can be seen, an iron catwalk running above
a large pool of excrescence.  Two wide, oiled grooves in the walls sit snug
up against this side of the grate.  In the ceiling above, a large strip of
metal runs between the tops of the two grooves.  The tall granite walls and
ceiling of this room are surprisingly clean, the stone free of any trace of
grime or filth.  Though the floor is covered with over a foot of glutinous,
slimy waste and the air reeks with the stagnating excrement, the rest of the
vaulted tunnel has somehow remained free of befoulment.  The wide tunnel
stretches away to the east, the walls conspicuously blank of any other pipes
or grates.

A rusty iron ladder extends upward through a round hole in the ceiling,
leading through a dark, rusty metal chute which smells faintly of sewage. 
The sound of splattering, splashing filth filters faintly down from above,
but oddly, none of the muck seems to fall through the opening.  The shaft
opens at the bottom into a dark stone room, dimly lit by a greasy yellow,
inconstant light which flickers down the open hallway which stretches east. 
The air here is dry and smells of cold earth, chilly and dusty.

an end several paces down.  Southwards, the hall passes between a pair of
doors and continues on its way.  The air is dry and chill, smelling of dust

hall passes an unremarkable wooden door of antique make to the west.  The
air is dry and chill, smelling of dust and cold earth.  The ceiling is a
dirty, whitewashed mortar of some sort, and the floor made from cheap,
slightly uneven flagstones.

A Low, Chilly Room~
This low, rough room is walled mostly in a poured mortar, whitewashed a
dirty ivory.  The western wall is made from a dark, worn gneiss, a plain
wooden door allowing access in that direction.  Small and square, the room
is decidedly chilly, and traces of damp show around the corners.  Several
large crates stand empty at the back of the room, and three moth- and
rat-eaten bolts of cheap burlap lean against a wall.  A stack of pig iron
rusts slowly in one corner, the massive iron ingots corroding into one,
fused piece.

A Small, Vaulted Room~
This small, square room is made from a dark, banded gneiss, the masonry
solid and well-fitting, though showing signs of great age.  The floor is
made of the same neatly-laid stone block, and the ceiling is some type of
poured mortar, whitewashed a dirty ivory.  A small, unremarkable door made
of wooden planks sits in the eastern wall.  A small brazier stands in one
corner, the cheap coal within filling the air with the smell of smoke,
though raising the temperature noticeably.  A threadbare rug of faded red
wool covers most of the floor here, looking forlorn and depressingly thin. 
Three small wooden chairs sit huddled around the brazier, and a long shelf
on southern wall holds a few cracked jars and limp flour sacks.  Crumbs
litter the floor, and several bits of old bones of various food animals lie
about, tossed carelessly away.  A small alcove to the west is curtained off.

A Tiny Alcove~
This tiny cramped alcove is walled in dark, banded gneiss.  Odd,
mismatching shelves and crates line the wall, stacked and stuffed wherever
they can fit.  This seems to be some sort of cache of stolen goods, many of
them stripped of value or worthless to begin with.  The ceiling is less than
six feet tall, made from some rough, poured mortar.  The air is dusty and
filled with an old smell of must.  A moth-eaten curtain leads back east into
a larger room filled with inconstant yellow light.

A Vertical Chute~
A rusty iron ladder extends downward through this dark, rusty metal
chute, leading up into a foul-smelling passage.  The foul stench of raw
sewage is strong in the air, but seems to diminish below.  The sound of
splattering, splashing filth filters down from above, but oddly, none of the
muck seems to make it to this point in the chute.  The shaft leads down,
opening into a dim room.  The space below seems partially lit by a greasy
yellow, inconstant light.  The air seems to be layered here; the air from
above is wet and humid, laden with the reek of filth, whereas that from
below is much drier, smelling of cold earth.

A Sloping, Tapering Drain~
This huge drain of a room is shaped like an enormous funnel.  The western
end is nearly fourteen feet in diameter, fed by a comparatively tiny sliver
of drain in the bottom of the wall.  A heavy iron hatch leads westward,
accessed by a short iron ladder.  The metal sides of this drain are coated
with a thick, gelatinous scum of an evil-looking green.  Tapering sharply
downwards to the east, the funnel ends at its eastern extremity in a hinged
grate which opens out into the roof of some large stone tunnel.  The sides
are utterly smooth and slick, and any earthbound being would be hard pressed
not to slide instantly down the slick tube.  A constant flow of thick,
gloppy sewage gurgles in from the west, skimming down into the stone tunnel
eastward.

A Small Crawlspace~
This low stone tunnel is cramped and narrow.  Though apparently only a
connecting passage for maintenance, it does not seem as if anyone has ever
maintained anything in this section of sewer.  The walls are made of
roughly-carved grey stone which seems to be constantly filmed with a sheen
of condensation made grubby with the dirt of decades.  About an inch of
foul, stagnant water sloshes on the floor here, filling the air with the
pungent reek of sewage.  Small iron grates stand at either end of the
passage which runs almost exactly from north to south.  A small metal wheel
protrudes from the wall beside the southern grate.

This crude antechamber is built from blocks of yellowish-grey stone, the

against the western wall.  Several squat lamps, hooded with pink, beaded
shades, illumine the room.  A hairy carpet of reddish wool, heavily stained
and besmirched, covers the floor.  The room stinks of body odor and perfume,
a small, smoking brazier adding the pungent reek of inexpensive incense to

A Perfume-Soaked Alcove~
This small alcove, dug into the raw earth itself, stinks of cheap perfume
and wet earth, combined with the odor of unwashed bodies.  Long sheets of
pink cloth covering the entrance.  The low-grade chiffon is sheer enough to
allow the hallway\@s light to pass through, illuminating the niche dimly.  An
oaken chiffonier lined with bottles of oddly-colored liquids within hangs on
one wall.  A short-backed sofa rests in a corner of the alcove, sickeningly
gaudy cherry-hue fitting the over-all style of the chambers.  Wooden planks
line the ground, half-covered by rugs and assorted furs, seemingly an
attempt to conceal the over-all begrimed appearance of the room.  More
lengths of heavy red canvas line the walls, masking the raw stone and dirt
behind.  You may exit the alcove through the curtain to the west.

A Cheaply Decorated Room~
This room is decorated with garish tastelessness, every hem in the room
drowning in frilly, foppish lace.  From the wall hangings to the cushions to
even the ragged, sad carpet, nothing has been spared.  A plain set of pine
shelves lean drunkenly against the back wall, bare and empty.  The air is
reeking with perfume and the smells of stale bodies.  A small lantern,
hooded and draped in pink lace, illumines the room with dim, flickering
light.  The ceiling is dirty plaster, cracked and stained with damp and age.
A filthy mattress lies in the center of the floor, covered in faded red
sheets.  A curtain of lace-trimmed canvas hangs in the opening to the south,
providing a modicum of privacy for this small alcove.

A Garish Alcove~
This small nook, dug into the raw earth off of the stone shaft to the
north, has been lined with warped planks and hung with large amounts of
cheaply-woven cloth.  Once dyed a vivid fuschia, water, damp, and time have
faded the cloth to a dilute, sickly pink.  A mound of lumpy cushions is
piled in one corner, a depression showing it to be regularly used.  A solid
wooden table sits to one side.  The air is filled with the reek of sweat and
perfume, and tinged with the hint of oily smoke and sewage.  A gauzy curtain
provides the barest amount of privacy between this alcove and the stairwell
to the north.

A Square Stone Shaft~
This square stone shaft has converted into a crude stairwell by a
disconcertingly rickety carpentering of scrap wood which serves as a stair. 
The creaky stairs spiral above and below you around the edges of the
stairwell, punctuated by small landings outside of the many alcoves which
have been built off the shaft.  The air is filled with the cloyingly strong
stink of body odor and cheap perfume, and incense smoke wafts through the

A Gaudy Alcove~
This round alcove is garishly decorated in an overload of pinks and
fuschias.  The crude stone walls, streaked with grime and grit, are almost
completely covered with coarse flax hangings stained various shades of the
same rich pink.  A hairy pink carpet of dirty wool covers the floor, and
cushions are strewn wantonly about the room.  A simple pine dresser stands
against the southern wall, the legs and base furred with mold.  Two
guttering candles light the room, floating in heart-shaped dishes filled
with greasy water.  The air is laden with cheap perfume, cloyingly strong. 
An old mattress lies in the center of the floor, a definite depression in

The Bottom of a Square Stone Shaft~
This square stone shaft has converted into a crude stairwell by a
disconcertingly rickety carpentering of scrap wood which serves as a stair. 
The shaft ends here, the bottom covered in two feet of piled refuse and
waste.  The stench, while normally reekingly strong, is almost muted against
the backdrop of the sewer\@s everpresent stink.  The creaky stairs spiral
above you around the edges of the stairwell, punctuated by small landings

A Tawdry Room~
This tawdry room\@s sagging and cracked plaster walls are painted with
faded pink paint, a misshapen attempt at an erotic mural disgracing the
western face.  A bed of lumpy cushions is piled in the southeastern corner,
the fabric adding the stench of unwashed bodies to the perfume-drenched air.
The floor is covered in stained, warped pine planks, slightly furry with
damp and mold around the corners.  A tiny table stands crookedly by the
opening to the stairwell, covered in a coarse macrame doily.  A pink-hooded

Before a Small Altar~
This room is merely a tiny, curved alcove recessed into the side wall of
a long, low hall.  The air is thick with smoke, the smell of stale bodies,
and alcohol fumes.  Curved walls of cracked, aging mortar are stained and
streaked in places, and the floor is covered with a layer of slimy, slippery
rushes which smell of rot and urine.  A heavy canvas curtain, dyed a cheap
red, separates the alcove from the rest of the hall.  

The space is dominated by a heavy wooden altar, curved to match the sweep of
the wall.  The dense wood is stained a ruddy brown, and rough scenes of
battle, pursuit, and contest are carved into the sides.  A small dais before
the altar has been swept clean.  An emblem of a large, glowing wheel has
been carved and painted on the wood in gold.  A small, round hole in the
altar allows dedicants to make their donations.

A Stone Crawlspace~
This small crawlspace is walled in cool, grimy granite.  Directly to the
west, the passage ends in a semiopaque glass wall, the opposite side of
which seems to be silvered as a mirror.  About five feet tall and barely two
wide, the passage is clearly seldom used.  The walls perspire with the
condensed moisture, the pervasive damp combining with years of grit and
grime to feed the slick mold which accumulates in the corners.  The room
through the glass to the west is vaguely visible -- hanging cloths and

A Dark, Cramped Tunnel~
You are at the convergence of three tunnels through the earth.  The
ceiling is low, hard-packed dirt and natural rock, as are the walls.  The
floor is a layer of mud atop a series of poorly-laid stone which peters off
to the north.  To the south, the rough tunnel continues, and to the west
becomes a stone-walled passage.  The intersection appears to be rather old,
dug with much cruder methods than the tunnel to the west.  The air is cool
and damp, smelling of rich earth with the faint undertones of sewage and

This small, sloping tunnel continues to descend as it curves to the

To the south, the rough tunnel continues, becoming slightly less dirty.  The

A Sloping, Cramped Tunnel~
This cramped tunnel dead-ends abruptly here, the crude earthen walls and
floor collapsed to the west.  A floor of slickened mud grows slightly more
dry to the south, as does the damp ceiling.  Patches of greenish mold coat
the lower parts of the walls with a faint grey fur, adding a unique
mustiness to the air.  The cave-in to the west dips downwards sharply,
apparently having merged two tunnels.  Scummy, opaque water can be seen in

A Hidden Cell~
This cramped space is about four feet from floor to ceiling and six
square.  A depressed area in the middle acts as a place for occupants\@ feet
and legs, with the resulting ledge functioning as a sort of bench. 
Apparently some sort of hiding-place, the cold, yellow stone walls are
scratched by many an idle hand.  Small, concealed slits in the roof allow
for a modicum of stale, smoky air to filter in.  A pair of iron rungs lead
up to a large, loosened block of stone which can be lifted to provide exit.

A Small Side-Alcove~
This narrow, dark room is filled with the reek of raw sewage.  Stiflingly
heavy air is thick with a ripe humidity.  Dully-glazed brown brick presses
in on all sides, the sweating masonry sticky with the grime of decade upon
decade.  Roughly six feet square, the short room is low enough to make
taller adventurer\@s stoop.  A round shaft opens in the filthy brick floor,
lined with iron rungs leading down into darkness.  A cooler, drier draft
wafts from this shaft, heavy with the smells of age and dust.  To the north,
a doorway descends two small steps to a narrow brick passage.

A Tiny, Ancient Chamber~
This tiny chamber is built from rough, black stone blocks, the mortarless
masonry clearly ancient.  Five feet square, the room is nearly twelve feet
in height.  The chilly air is laden with the smells of dust and still, aging
emptiness.  A round shaft of glazed brown bricks opens in the ceiling, iron
rungs on the north wall climbing up to the entrance and through the shaft
into darkness.  The smells of raw sewage drift from above, the air feeling
wetter and warmer as an occasional fetid breath wafts down.  A short doorway
opens in the southern wall, a crude symbol scratched deeply into the stone
over the lintel.

This ancient stone tunnel is built from raw, cold blocks of dark rock. 
The mortarless masonry is many centuries old, yet does not show any sign of
extensive travel as might be expected in such an aged place.  Quite narrow,
the passage is over twelve feet in height.  Dark and still, the air is

This narrow stone passage is chillingly cold and dark, the rough stone
walls coarse and unworn by the centuries.  The smell of dust is chokingly
heavy in the air, the air almost stagnant but for the faintest of drafts. 
The tunnel runs to the east and curves sharply around a tight corner to the
south, more a crevice between two stone pilings than a true tunnel.  Dust
lies thickly on the stone floor.  The natural stillness and silence of the
empty darkness is almost oppressive, seeming a tangible thing.

A Shadowy Meditation Chamber~
Stones stained dark with moisture arch over the entrance, opening into a
circular room.  Melting candles litter the perimeter of the near seamless
wall, flickering across the curved beams of polished redwood, revealing no
other apparent exit.  A paper lantern dangles from the shadowy ceiling, its
gloomy light filtering through thin blue paper into the smoky haze.  A
crudely rounded stone slab sits beneath.  A clay pot riddled with holes
squats between the candles.  Oval mats, thatched with reed, surround the low
table.  Opposite the entrance stands a folding screen of oiled parchment,
silhouettes playing across its semi-translucent panes.  The chamber is
large, but the darkness somehow crowds into the open space, making it feel
much smaller.

on top.

paper blue thin lantern~
This paper lantern is formed from a smallish globe of bamboo struts, bent

of enchanted light glimmers within, filtering through the bluish paper and
casting a decidedly gloomy light throughout the chamber.

An Empty Closet~
This room seems to have once been a storage closet, though nothing
remains within but a veneer of dust on the floor.  Pine timbers stand in
each corner of the closet from floor to ceiling.  The air is thick with the
scents of alcohol and tobacco, perfume and incense.  The smooth grey stone
of the surrounding walls does little more than muffle the sounds outside;
the raucous laughter and delighted shrieks nearby readily penetrate this
chamber.  A simple wooden door opens outward through the eastern wall.

You tumble and whirl through an incomprehensible chaos.  Bands of energy
and light flash and skitter crazily through shapes and bolts of color and
sound.  Forms ranging from painfully indistinct to oppressively concrete
approach and recede at all speeds, hovering slowly or zooming with
unimaginable speed.  An ocean of sound foams and swirls about you,
assaulting your ears with screams, hums, whistles, every possible frequency
seeming to vie for dominance.

This narrow, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage. 
Stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe humidity.  Dully-glazed brown
brick presses in on all sides, the sweating masonry sticky with the grime of
decade upon decade.  A shallow runnel travels east to north along the length
of the tunnel, following it into darkness in either direction.  This section
of the tunnel seems to be seldom traveled, judging by the largely
undisturbed nature of the filth to either side of the channel.  Smaller,
grooved channels emerge from the walls to join with the larger at regular
intervals, feeding waste into the slowly-moving, glutinous scum which fills
the runnel.  At the bend in the tunnel, large clumps of semisolid
putrescence have accumulated, augmenting the already overwhelming stench.

A Muck-Filled Tunnel~
This narrow, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage. 
Stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe humidity.  The cramped corridor
seems to have been built for nefortu, or perhaps short humans.  Dully-glazed
brown brick presses in on all sides, the sweating masonry sticky with the
grime of decade upon decade.  A shallow runnel travels north to west along
the length of the tunnel, following it into darkness in either direction. 
Small, grooved channels emerge from the walls to join with the larger at
regular intervals, feeding waste into the slowly-moving, glutinous scum
which fills the runnel.  Here, the more solid waste has accumulated at the
bend in the tunnel, forming a putrescent dam.  Behind the semisolid wall,
the glutinous muck is several inches deep.

A Cramped Basement~
This cramped, dark basement is awash with conflicting smells.  The heavy
reek of raw sewage drifts from the darkness northward and combines with the
the pungent scents of exotic swamp fauna coming from the trap door above. 
The dim light from the trap door illuminates a short, simple ladder embedded
into the worn brown brick of the walls.  A few crates are stacked in a
corner.  The floor is hard-packed dirt, becoming slick with a film of damp
mud towards the northern end of the room.  Low wooden beams, solid and
sturdy, form the floor of the building above.  A small side passage leads to
the north.

This hexagonal chamber is low and dark, the sweating, glazed-brick walls
coated with grime.  In some places the dirt shows signs of ineffectual
sweeping, in places allowing the yellow torchlight to reflect dully.  The
floor is covered with sickly-sweet rushes, the slimy, slippery footing
rotting and dank.  The low ceiling is a rough, pebbly mortar, and seems to
be the foundation of a building.  Several crude sconces have been hacked
into the soft brick, filling the room with smoky, flickering light.  A short
hallway leads to a door to the south, and the room opens up to the east and
north.  In the northwest corner of the room, what appears to be a large
cesspool has been covered with a carven stone lid, and the pipe from above
blocked with several handfuls of disgustingly filthy rags and straw.

This alcove is walled in on two sides by filthy brown brick walls, and on
the other two by piled crates and boxes.  These crates are stacked in
several piles to the considerably low ceiling, the casks and boxes nearer
the top appearing to be newer and less coated by the omnipresent grime. 
Markings and brands on the various containers show them to be from all
locales and industries; salts from Ashta Harrud, Qilarn wine, and Alensha
dushasn are all visible, along with many other less-obvious contents.  A
small path winds between the piles vaguely westward into a feebly-lit room.

A Crumbling Ledge Above the Murk~
The ancient, dull-orange brick walls of this chamber are warped and
bowed, forming an amorphous, dank room, into which three tunnels lead.  A
wide, mud-covered ledge of uneven brick sits just above the surface of the
cloudy, greenish-grey pool of sludgy water which covers the rest of the
floor.  A pair of empty metal torch-sconces, heavily corroded with time,
flank a set of iron rungs that lead upward to a now-blocked hole in the
ceiling.  The crumbling brick walls are caked with centuries of grime and
muck, disappearing beneath the nearly opaque water.  The air is stale and
heavy, thick with the churning reek of stagnant sewage.  Two tunnels,
half-filled with the disgusting water, lead off to the north and east. 
Southward, a tunnel dips beneath the murk\@s surface.

A Filthy, Submerged Tunnel~
This tunnel is entirely filled with a thick, murky fluid which renders
vision rather difficult.  The greyish-green water is filthy and heavy with
centuries of accumulated waste.  The walls of the tunnel, mostly obscured by
untold years of sitting beneath stagnant water, are coated in a thick layer
of a dark, slimy substance.  The curving walls dip down in the center of
this area, then angle slowly to the north and south, climbing out of the
near-opaque water and allowing for somewhat drier passage.

A Murky, Damp Tunnel~
A square passage leads upwards at the southern end of the tunnel, here, a
rickety ladder providing access.  The walls of the passage are brick, though
the dully-glazed brown blocks give way to far older, crumbling orange-tinged
ones.  The floor of the tunnel is hidden by several inches of squelchy,
reeking mud.  The air is stale and humid, thick with the stench of stagnant
sewage and an older, earthier smell.  The tunnel walls begin to bow slightly
inwards as the passage dips below the surface of the cloudy, greenish-grey
water which fills the tunnel to the north.

A Dank, Muddy Passage~
The grime-covered brick walls of this tunnel are bowed slightly inwards
here.  The slimy muck which covers every surface begrudgingly allows the
orange-brown brick to peep through in a few small places.  A slender stream
of the cloudy, muddy water follows the curve of the tunnel to the north and
east.  The dark, cramped tunnel is thick with the stench of stagnating
sewage, the air calm and stale.  Occasional drips of moisture fall
disconsolately into the layer of muck covering the floor.

A Salt-Encrusted, Sloping Tunnel~
The walls of this wide tunnel are made of lime-covered stones, laid
unevenly long ago in a gentle slope down from east to west.  Unused for
generations, the circular tube has begun to crumble and collapse in places,
leaving a thick layer of salts and debris along the damp floor.  The entire
space is infused with a pungent, damp odor that hangs thickly in the room,
making what remains of the air rather difficult to breathe.  The tunnel
branches three ways here, heading through a water-filled dip into a large
chamber to the west, a smaller chamber to the south, and continues up the
gentle gradient eastward.

This round, cylindrical chamber is walled in crumbling, dull orange
brick.  A small, ovoid tunnel enters from the north about halfway up the
side of the tank, five rust-coated iron rungs leading up to the the small
access.  The room is filled roughly one-third full of a thick, gooey mire of
rotted sewage and waste, in places so ancient and decayed as to be more rich
black soil than true filth.  The stench is incredible, however, the reek of
excrement so pervasive it seems to coat the mouth and lungs with its sickly

rests in the hollow formed by the junction of three oddly-shaped tunnels,
running in a trickle of watery fluid out to the east along the squelchy,
mud-covered ground.  To the south, the tunnel angles downward, a wide ledge

bottom of the crater-like floor.  To the west, a broken section of the wall
reveals a tiny, low tunnel which tapers through the muddy earth.  Forking

in the humid, stale air.  A few of the rocks of the cave-in have

A Dank, Narrow Tunnel~
This small, stone room is walled with neatly-laid stone blocks , the
masterful masonry evidently relatively new.  The room is cramped and dark,
smelling strongly of wet stone and tainted with the scent of raw sewage.  A
sturdy metal door, painted a drab grey, travels westward through the wall. 
No gap of any sort can be seen around the edges of this door; it seems to
seal perfectly into the stone around it.  A mass of pipes runs from ceiling
to floor in this room, the large bunch comprised of pipes roughly six inches
in diameter.  A loud gurgling emanates from the metal, reverbating in the
tiny chamber.  The wall to the east has had several blocks pried from it
recently, revealing a short tunnel through the clayey earth.

A Yawning Subterranean Chamber~
This large cave-like chamber appears to have been created by a sinkhole
of some sort.  Its walls are ragged, chalky limestone, with sharp edges
angling downward along each wall.  It is filled with cloudy, foul-smelling
water at its base, yet stretches nearly forty feet high at its tallest
point.  Several scratch marks are evident in the soft stone walls, each long
set of gouges grouped in fours.  The floor is almost completely obscured
beneath the water\@s filthy surface, only visible near the southernmost point
of the chamber.  The clayey mud is studded with bits of broken brick and
limestone.  A gap climbs over a small cave-in of stones southward, into a
dank, circular chamber.

An Intersection of Foul Tunnels~
This round tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, filled with about two
feet of thick, sludgy water, a semi-opaque unpleasant greenish-grey.  The
crumbling, dull-orange brick walls of the tunnel are eroded and falling
apart with age, coated with a layer of transparent slime.  The tunnel sinks
almost completely under the water to the south, and continues through the
knee-deep water to the the east and north.  In these two directions it seems
to deepen as well, though not quite as drastically.  The air here is humid,
dank, and still, so stale as to be almost spent of its life-sustaining
properties.  Thick with the reek of sewage, the tunnel is dark and close, a
small pocket deep under the bowels of the city.

A Narrow, Foul Tunnel~
This round tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, filled about halfway
with thick, sludgy water of a semi-opaque greenish-grey hue.  The crumbling,
dull-orange brick walls of the tunnel are eroded and falling apart with age.
The tunnel rises slightly to the west, and continues through the deepening
water to the the east and north.  To the east, the tunnel dips and seems to
become even more decrepit, while the way to the north appears a little more
clear.  The air here is humid, dank, and still, so stale as to be almost
drained of its life-sustaining properties.  Thick with the reek of sewage,
the tunnel is dark and close, a small pocket deep under the bowels of the
city.

A Cave-In~
This round tunnel, as wide as six feet in diameter towards the west,
tapers into a dead-end, filled about halfway with thick, sludgy water of a
semi-opaque greenish-grey hue.  The eastern end is obstructed by a collapsed
section of tunnel, the crumbling, dull-orange brick walls mingled with clay
and stones from above.  The tunnel rises slightly to the west, the only
visible exit from this fetid end.  The air here is humid, dank, and still,
so stale as to be almost drained of its life-sustaining properties.  Thick
with the reek of sewage, the tunnel is dark and close, a small pocket deep
under the bowels of the city.

A Murk-Filled Dead End~
This round, dark tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, filled almost to
the descending ceiling with thick, sludgy water of a semi-opaque
greenish-grey hue.  The crumbling, dull-orange brick walls of the tunnel are
eroded and falling apart with age.  In places the ancient bricks and mortar
have given away completely, small piles of mud marking the final resting

the western wall.  The abandoned sewer has crumbled completely here, a pile
of mud, clay, stones, and broken bricks forbidding any further progress
north.  The tunnel rises slightly out of the water to the south, the only

still, so stale as to be almost drained of its life-sustaining properties.
