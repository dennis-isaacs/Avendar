Mofi short human snake oil~
mofi~
A short human sits on a crate, a box of vials in his lap.
~
\#Snake Oil\# Mofi is short for a human, at about five feet two inches. 
Well beyond his prime, he is as portly as he is short, but has the
appearance of one who hasn\@t lose strength despite present conditioning and
age.  A two-day stubble darkens his chin and cheeks.  His curly black hair
is streaked with grey and is slicked back in a thick tangled mass which
reeks of animal lard.

Kruz~
A deformed nefortu stands here, peddling a tray of used wands.
~
An old nefortu, his face horribly deformed as if by fire or acid, stands
here.  His nose is missing except for a small irregular stub of flesh that
line the bare, scarred slits of his nostrils, and his lips are
misproportioned and set at odd angles.  He holds out an old worn tray lined
in faded green velvet, whereupon rest many equally old and worn wands.

an enormous, spidery crab~
An enormous insectoid is here, long, slender legs arching from a quivering, baggy body.
~
This enormous spider-like crab has six long, segmented legs which arch
high into the air, the spindly, pointed appendages somehow conveying the
image of many more legs.  The long legs are covered in a tough exoskeleton
of mottled greyish brown, the dully reflective surface bespattered with
filthy sewage.  Countless rows of small, spiky hairs line the legs, the
stiff black bristles sharp and needle-like.  The legs converge at a small
body the shape of a flattened globe.  Several pairs of small, shiny black
eyes line the body, though no mouth is visible.  Slung underneath the
compact, flat body is a gelatinous bulge of baggy, leathery skin which
terminates in a limply swaying mass of glistening tentacles.  Foul
secretions drip from these tentacles, and a faint hissing sounds from the
revolting underside.

a large catfish~
A large black catfish swims through lazily.
~
This black catfish is about four feet long, spiked dorsal fin breaking
the surface of the water occasionally.  Large, antenna-like whiskers
protrude from the sides of its wide, flat mouth, helping it to navigate
through the near-opaque water.  Goggling eyes are pearlescent and blind, and
the pale underbelly is oddly translucent.

This pale fish is a faint pinkish color, milky body quite translucent.

A pale, long-legged cave frog is here.

This pale frog glistens wetly, translucent skin covered in a slick of
protective slime.  Two enormous eyes, filmed over with a milky tissue,
protrude blindly from the top of its head.  Skinny front legs are tipped
with pad-like fingers, and the long, muscular legs are nearly as large as
the narrow body.  The rear legs wriggle unpleasantly whenever the frog moves
through the water, the smooth, blind undulation somehow repulsive.

Razeilm~
The crazy hermit Razeilm stands here lost in his own delusions.
~
Razeilm is a shabbily dressed hermit who wraps himself in various colored
rags that he had found during his sojourns outside of the sewers.  A short
and emaciated elderly man, his ribcage show clearly through his hole-ridden
rags.  A foul odor, with a hint of a medicinal aroma, surrounds him.  His
skin is encrusted with filth and dirt, hinting to the fact that he has not
washed himself in a very long time.  He gives off a feral aura, mainly by
the wild look of his eyes as they dart erratically about from place to
place, never resting.  A wide array of scars is visible along his arms, some
of them still pink and healing.

she died, and her hawk-like eyes still blaze with the energy that she must
have had in life.  Her brows are furrowed though, and her demeanor is stern,
giving her the look of a holy judge of those still upon the mortal coil.

A massive altar of black stone sits squarely in the center of this
chamber. Once a sewer chamber, this place has been converted into a place
of diabolic mystical focus.  The walls are clearly made from the bricks of
the old sewer, but they have been meticulously cleaned and inscribed with a
multitude of sinister runes.  Underfoot, solid blocks of granite have been
set over the muddy floor, then warded with some magic to repel water from
welling up.  Curiously, the all-pervasive strench of the sewers is very
faint here, replaced by an acrid, alchemical odor.  Illuminating the room
are braziers of smoldering coals, placed strategically to keep the altar
shadowed. There are exits in all four directions from this place, but of
note is the iron portcullis which blocks travel to the north and a sturdy
steel door to the east.

A massive altar of black stone sits squarely in the center of this
chamber. Once a sewer chamber, this place has been converted into a place
of diabolic mystical focus.  The walls are clearly made from the bricks of
the old sewer, but they have been meticulously cleaned and inscribed with a
multitude of sinister runes.  Underfoot, solid blocks of granite have been
set over the muddy floor, then warded with some magic to repel water from
welling up.  Curiously, the all-pervasive strench of the sewers is very
faint here, replaced by an acrid, alchemical odor.  Illuminating the room
are braziers of smoldering coals, placed strategically to keep the altar
shadowed. There are exits in all four directions from this place, but of
note are the sturdy iron portcullises which block travel to the north and
east.

This passage through the sewer is cold and dank, with a floor of thick,
black mud.  The walls here are sturdy granite, the ancient stones mortared
together time and again over the centuries.  Numerous small pipes and drains
are poised to empty raw sewage from above, but they have all been sealed
over recently.  To the north, the sewer continues, and the air is rancid and
foul. Here, though, there is surprisingly little stench.  Instead, a faint,
almost alchemical odor is present, growing stronger to the south.

an enormous rat~
An enormous rat lurks about.
~
This rat is almost two feet long from nose to tail-tip, its glossy black
fur and bright, beady black eyes descriptive of plentiful food. 
Yellow-orange teeth are visible in the underslung mouth, and the nose
twitches eagerly as the rat constantly scents the air.  Sharp claws, active
ears, and a long, bald tail add to the repulsive nature of the rodent.

A dark rat searches for food.

This sewer rat is an indistinct dark brownish black, about a foot and a
half from nose to tail-tip.  Small, rounded ears lie flat against its head,
and its dark pelt is glossily wet.  An ever-twitching nose keeps alert for
food or predators, and sharp, claw-tipped paws move with silent efficiency. 
A bald tail hovers behind for balance, long and slender.  Beady black eyes

Jissas~
A frail caladaran is here, face worn with age and care.
~
This tall caladaran is dressed in shabby, dirty robes which may have once
been a blue, but have faded to a grimy, pale grey.  A careworn face holds
milky white eyes which strain to fulfil their function as sight organs, and
his wrinkled cheeks free of facial hair.  A tall brow features two
astonishingly bushy eyebrows of a dusty green, and an unruly shock of hair
of the same color perches atop his head.  Strong hands are showing definite
signs of aging, the bones more prominent, and a few small freckle-like spots
speckled across the backs.  A vacant smile lurks about the frail caladaran\@s
lips.

This small girl cannot be older than seven or eight.  Thin legs and arms
protrude from a ragged piece of fabric which may have been a sack some

Her face is dirty, and her feet are wrapped in rags, but the child seems

Jissas~
A tall caladaran stands here defiantly, his lined face blazing with fury.
~
This tall caladaran is dressed in shabby, dirty robes which may have once
been a blue, but have faded to a grimy, pale grey.  A careworn face shows
brown eyes which normally might be kindly, but which now blaze with
indignant fury.  His wrinkled cheeks are free of facial hair, quivering with
emotion.  A tall brow features two astonishingly bushy eyebrows of a dusty
green, and an unruly shock of hair of the same color perches atop his head. 
Strong hands are showing definite signs of aging, the bones more fragile and
prominent.  A few small freckle-like spots are speckled across the backs of
the angrily clenched hands.

A scrawny boy is here, examining a bit of rock with interest.
~
This scrawny child looks to be about eleven or twelve.  He has the drawn,
unhealthy air of someone who has grown far too quickly.  Skinny arms and
legs are covered with dirt, as are a pair of threadbare pantaloons and a
baggy shirt.  His hair is a mess, but bright, active eyes peer out from a
healthy face.  The child seems happy and in good health, if a bit grimy.

- all other details have faded.  

The second boot is a common sailor\@s, the thick tar used to weatherproof it
having kept it safe also from the ravages of the sewer.

Earendam.  Owned by one who did a lot of walking, judging by the manner of
wear of the fabric under the arm, the jerkin\@s wearer was murdered -- an old
bloodstain is barely discernible around a small, distinctive tear in the
chest.

A pair of cotton trousers, stained and reeking, lies in a heap.~
These plain trousers are relatively unremarkable, belonging once to a
laborer in a quarry of some sort.  The tight weave of the cotton suggests
that they were worn by one who dealt with mining or excavations of some
sort, judging by the style and locations of the creases and the fraying.

long immersion in water, though the glasses have been cleaned lovingly.  The
lenses, long gone, were held in place by a thin rim on the outside of the

removed before the exposure to whichever corrosive substance ate at the

crushed Uthlin siltshells and permanenced by the juice of pressed fenweed,
the brilliant silk strip is a castoff scrap from the bottom of a robe or

speak of constant humidity.  The greenish silt-rich mud, soaked into the
spongy paper, has been taken from the bottom of a submerged channel.  The
orangeish mud bears crumbs and tiny chips of old brick, of the type used in
Earendam\@s construction, and the yellowish clay comes from a vein of soil
rich with ochre.  The soot comes from pine torches, carefully daubed onto
the paper with a small finger.

This narrow, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage. 
Stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe humidity.  Dully-glazed brown
brick presses in on all sides, the sweating masonry sticky with the grime of
decade upon decade.  A rough floor of irregular stone makes footing
uncertain in the near-darkness.  Cobwebs dangle and float, ghostlike and
pale, moved by the barest hint of an undetectable draft.  A low wooden door
stands in the southern wall, swollen and slimy with damp.  The passage
terminates to the north, a rickety wooden ladder leading down into a square
of blackness.  The smell from the level below is colder and more earthy, an
older smell than the warm reek of rotting sewage from the south, though by
no means free of the distinctive source of exrescence.

This tall, vaulted stone tunnel runs north to south, the tightly-joined
granite blocks which form the walls and ceiling of this room surprisingly
clean and free of any trace of grime or filth.  Though the floor is covered
with over a foot of glutinous, slimy waste and the air reeks with the
stagnating excrement of hundreds of citizens, the rest of the vaulted tunnel
has somehow remained free of befoulment.  The wide tunnel stretches away to
the north and south, the walls conspicuously blank of any other pipes or
grates.

The End of a Vaulted Stone Tunnel - south to 7246~
This tall, vaulted stone tunnel runs north to south, the tightly-joined
granite blocks which form the walls and ceiling of this room surprisingly
clean and free of any trace of grime or filth.  The passage to the south is
blocked by a pair of closed metal doors, painted a drab grey, which slide
from the walls and meet in the middle.  Though the floor is covered with
over a foot of glutinous, slimy waste and the air reeks with the stagnating
excrement of hundreds of citizens, the rest of the vaulted tunnel has
somehow remained free of befoulment.  The wide tunnel stretches away to the
north, the walls conspicuously blank of any other pipes or grates.  The
sounds of moving water and city life carry faintly through the doors,
muffled considerably.

A Large Sewer Tunnel~
This large tunnel branches off from the main network of sewer
passageways.  The walls of the tunnel are rougher, in many places nothing
but mud, and appear to be of an older construction than the tunnels to the
north.  While the foul miasma of the sewers still persists here, it is
obvious that these tunnels have not been used for many years.  The filthy
water covers the floor here, stagnant, though the old watermarks on the
sides show that these tunnels were once far more active.  Occasional pieces
of debris and garbage can still be seen floating within the brownish waters.
To the south this branch tunnel continues, while to the north the tunnel
climbs a steady incline.

An Ominous Tunnel~
This ominous tunnel is much smaller than the tunnel to the west.  This
tunnel appears to have been constructed to handle sewage from another part
of the sewers, but was halted before it was finished.  The tunnel walls have
holes where the natural stone and earth still show.  The darkness and the
smaller confines of the tunnel seem oppressive, dampening even the light
that is brought within it.  Sibilant sounds and murmurs can be heard rasping
in this tunnel as a constant background noise.  To the east one can see a
sickly green wall blocking what lies sight of what lies beyond.  From the
wall one hear far louder voices and murmurs that present a strange harmony
with the noises already within the tunnel.  While the sounds emanating from
the wall are unintelligible, they seem to be full of hate and sorrow.

The Lair of the Hermit~
The small tunnel comes to an end here as the digging of the tunnel had
stopped here long ago.  Now it is apparent that this part of the tunnel has
been converted into someone\@s home.  A small, rickety, wooden table stands
at the center of the room with a variety of items upon it.  All around the
rooms various niches have been carved from the stone walls and seemingly
useless junk are present within each niche.  A few strings of mushrooms are
strung around the room, drying and a pile of refuse lies in the corner.  A
small peat fire burns a distance away from the table, adding its stench and
smoke to the air.  Finally you also see a small pallet, constructed almost
entirely from what looks like discarded rags and mildewed clothing, tucked
into another corner.  To the west the sickly green wall still emits a
disturbing sound that fills the chamber.

Here in the tunnel some rubble has dammed much of the water, causing most
of the stagnant water to pool at the northern end, away from the very end of
the tunnel which descends into the pit beneath.  The walls of the tunnel are
rougher, and appear to be of an older construction than the tunnels to the
north, as well as being caked with a large residue of filth.  While the foul
miasma of the sewers still persists here, it is obvious that these tunnels
have not been used for many years.  A rusty steel ladder leads down into the
pit which appears to be half-filled with sewage and sludge, though the
occasional corpse can be seen, hinting towards the fact that this pit was
once used to dispose of corpses.

Within the Pit~
The pit is over thirty feet deep, and is fairly wide.  While the original
purpose of the pit might be unknown, it is obvious that it was used long ago
as a place to dispose of unwanted corpses.  The ancient decay of fetid
corpses, mixed in with sewage water, gives this place a distinctively
pungent smell.  This unhealthy mix comes up roughly to waist level, and
occasionally a dismembered body part can still be seen floating amongst the
garbage.  What lies beneath the water, however, cannot be readily seen due
to the opaqueness of the water.  The walls of the pit have been made smooth
by the accumulation of slippery sewage that covers it.  To the east and
south the pit continues, while a rusty steel ladder leads out of the water

Above a Yawning Subterranean Chamber~
This large cave-like chamber appears to have been created by a sinkhole
of some sort.  More than forty feet tall in some places, the roof is formed
by several large slabs of stone which seem to have wedged against one
another, blank and immobile.  Its walls are ragged, chalky limestone, with
sharp edges angling downward along each wall.  Below, a pool of cloudy,
foul-smelling covers the muddy floor.  Several scratch marks are evident in
the soft stone walls, each long set of gouges grouped in fours.  The air
here is uneasily still and stale, heavy with the reek of rot and damp. 
Below, a small gap in the southern wall leads from the chamber.

it soundproof and hidden from any potential seekers.  The walls of the

substance covers much of the wall.  The chamber itself is void of any

stench, and the sounds of trickling water all point to the nearby sewer, but
this place has no pipes or drain, and is oddly dry.  To the north, the faint
outline of a secret door is visible in the wall.

End of a Sewer Passage~
This chamber marks the end of a passage through the sewers.  Dank, filthy
water drips from innumerable crevices overhead, coagulating in turgid pools
underfoot.  The walls bulge into a semi-circle here, with most of the
original sewer architecture hidden behind thick lime.  On one side of the
room, bricks and mortar are visible, albeit smeared with filth.  The water
here not caught in pools drains slowly to the east, where the sewer passage
begins and slopes gently downward.

crude passage through the sewers.  The pungent, ripe odor of sewage clings
to everything here, from the crude walls smeared with filth to the floor,
which is caked with untold years of grime and offal.  A rusty iron ladder is
affixed to the wall, leading upwards and out of passage through the mouth of
a circular chute.  A thin trickle of water creeps through the middle of the
sewer, which extends in either direction out of sight into the darkness.

A Junction in the Sewer~
Several sewer tunnels come together here from various directions.  The
walls here are solid bricks, but not old enough to be from the centuries ago
when this place was originally constructed.  Its more recent age, however,
does not protect this tunnel from the ravages of use.  The air is dank and
septic, and encrusted limestone forms numerous stalagmites overhead. 
Underfoot, tainted water collects in turgid pools, occasionally brimming
over to make the entire passage muddy.  

There is a disquieting feel about this room, and you find it difficult to
discern one direction from another the longer you remain.  This feeling is
most intense by a wall, where a patch of filth has been wiped aside and a
sinister rune has been emblazoned.

depths.

Overlooking a Huge Drain~
A sewer passage comes to an end here, terminating in a semi-circular
grate in the eastern wall.  About a half-foot wide, the grate is too small
to allow much larger than a rat through, but above it is an iron hatch,
which opens eastward onto a huge drain, which runs perpendicular to this
passage.  A steady trickle of filthy water flows through here, falling
through the grate and into the drain, where it joins a torrent of other
sewage.  Through the grate, you can make out a ladder on the other side of
the hatch, no doubt allowing a trip to the bottom of the drain.

A Three-Way Junction in the Sewer~
Three sewer passages come together here, forming a three-way junction. 
The dank chill of the sewer is more noticeable here, as a cold draft brings
septic air from the depths.  Overhead, traces of the original stone masonry
of the sewer are visible in the arches supporting the intersecting tunnels. 
The walls are covered with thick mold and filth, and the ground is mainly
mud, with pools of brackish water here and there.

Underneath a Dripping Chute~
Sour, rank water drizzles here, falling from above through the mouth of a
dark, muddy chute.  Slick mud covers the floor, and the accumulated sewage
flows through a small grate near the eastern wall.  The rest of the room is
littered with solid, foul waste which has fallen from above and has been
left here to rot.  To the west, the muddy chamber turns into a passage
through the sewers.

A Bend in the Sewer~
This sewer passage twists south and east here, curving gently downward. 
Everywhere, there is the pungent, ripe odor of sewage, clinging and cloying.
The crude walls are smeared with filth, while the floor is caked with untold
years of grime and offal.  A thin trickle of brackish water drains from the
passage to the south and downward to the east.

A Junction in the Sewer~
Several sewer tunnels come together here from various directions.  The
walls here are solid bricks, but not old enough to be from the centuries ago
when this place was originally constructed.  Its more recent age, however,
does not protect this tunnel from the ravages of use.  The air is dank and
septic, and encrusted limestone forms numerous stalagmites overhead. 
Underfoot, tainted water collects in turgid pools, occasionally brimming
over to make the entire passage muddy.  

There is a disqueting feel about this room, and you find it difficult to
discern one direction from another the longer you remain.  This feeling is
most intense by a wall, where a patch of filth has been wiped aside and a
sinister rune has been emblazoned.

The Entrance to a Massive Drain~
A sewer passage comes to an end here, terminating in a semicircular grate
in the bottom of the eastern wall.  About a half-foot wide, the grate is too
small to allow much larger than a rat through, but above it is an iron hatch
which opens eastward into a huge drain.  This drain runs away to the east,
sloping down to some unknown destination.  A steady trickle of filthy water
flows through here, falling through the grate and into the drain, where it
joins a torrent of other sewage.  Through the grate, you can make out a
short ladder on the other side of the hatch, no doubt allowing a trip to the

A Passage through the Sewer~
This passage through the sewer is cold and dank, with a floor of thick,
black mud.  The walls here are sturdy granite, the ancient stones mortared
together time and again over the centuries.  Numerous small pipes and drains
are poised to empty raw sewage from above, but they have all been sealed
over recently.  To the north, the sewer continues, and the air is rancid and
foul. Here, though, there is surprisingly little stench.  Instead, a faint,
almost alchemical odor is present, growing stronger to the south.

portcullis~
The portcullis is made from iron, slightly rusted by the damp of the air

magical runes filed into the bars of the portcullis, presumably protective
in nature.

The Altar of the Aklaju~
A massive altar of black stone sits squarely in the center of this
chamber. Once a sewer chamber, this place has been converted into a place
of diabolic mystical focus.  The walls are clearly made from the bricks of
the old sewer, but they have been meticulously cleaned and inscribed with a
multitude of sinister runes.  Underfoot, solid blocks of granite have been
set over the muddy floor, then warded with some magic to repel water from
welling up.  Curiously, the all-pervasive strench of the sewers is very
faint here, replaced by an acrid, alchemical odor.  Illuminating the room
are braziers of smoldering coals, placed strategically to keep the altar
shadowed. There are exits in all four directions from this place, but of note
is the sturdy iron portcullis which blocks travel to the east.

A Charnal Room~
Judging from the ancient pipes and drains, this room was once a part of a
sewer.  This place\@s current function is not entirely dissimilar, as it is
devoted to the disposal of the dead.  Little care has been given to the
dignity of the dead, for numerous bodies have been mangled and strewn about
the room.  In the center of the chamber is a ring of black stones, each
inscribed with a rune.  Within the interior of the circle is a pool of pure
darkness, which crackles with some sinister mystical energy.  The room is
oddly free of the reek of both the sewer and the charnal house it has
become.  A likely explanation are two braziers, burning coals and some sort
of incense to produce both light and an acerbic, alchemical odor.  The only
exit is through an archway to the east.

Storage Room~
This place was once a sewer tunnel, but has recently been converted to a
storage room of some kind.  Fresh hay has been tossed on the muddy floor,
and any openings in the roof have been meticulously sealed to prevent water
from leaking on anything here.  A scrollcase stands flush with the north
wall, while a rack for holding wands and staves stands to the south.  A
sturdy metal trunk is bolted on the floor, sealed with a sturdy lock but
also carved with several large runes.  To the west is a thick wooden door,
and affixed to the wall next to it is an iron lever.

The Portal Chamber~
Once a tunnel in the sewer, this place has been restored and converted
into a habitable chamber.  The walls are scrubbed clean, and any place where
water might drain here has been plugged or mortared over.  Covering the
muddy floor are ornate tiles, each carved with a different runic image. 
Dominating the room, though, is a square archway made of ornate black stone.
The archway is freestanding, and clearly designed for some arcane purpose,
for a flickering black portal shimmers within.  The only mundane exit from
the room lies to the north.

A Decaying Sewer~
Filth and grime stain the corroded metal walls of this pipe under the

spongy in places.  Six feet in diameter, the conduit is coated in a layer of
mud and muck.  Thin trickles of putrid water issue from the smaller pipes
which empty into the tunnel, filling a large, fetid pool.  Unable to flow
anywhere, the waste has accumulated nearly a foot deep in this slanting
section of pipe.  The foul stench of raw sewage and decay clogs the air, and
the faint sounds of dripping water echo against the tunnel walls.  The older
pipe leads to an intersection to the east.  The western end is completely
blocked by a collapsed section of the thoroughly rusted pipe; decayed metal,
dirt, and a few bricks obstruct any passage to the west.

A Filthy Sewer~
This brick-walled, narrow passageway beneath the city meets with a
medium-sized sewer pipe here.  The pipe is roughly four and a half feet in
diameter, forcing even the smaller adventurers to stoop.  Ending in a
broken, rusted grate, it branches here, heading down a slight decline to the
south and running away west into darkness.  The metal of the conduit is
corroded and worn from untold decades of service, in places flaking off in
small, rusty chips.  Many smaller pipes and channels join this one at
regular intervals, streaked stains of grime beneath the openings.  The humid
air is cool, though thick with the reek of raw sewage.  A thin skim of slimy
waste covers the floor of the pipe, but any fresh filth flows quickly down
the pipe to the south.

A Brick-Walled Shaft - up to CdS II~
This narrow, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage. 
Stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe humidity.  Dully-glazed brown
brick presses in on all sides, the sweating masonry sticky with the grime of
decade upon decade.  The tunnel runs to the north and west, branching off to
the south.  A shallow, sewage-filled runnel follows along, disappearing into
darkness in all three directions.  Various pipes and channels emerge from
the walls to join with the larger at regular intervals, feeding waste into
the slowly-moving, glutinous scum which fills the runnel and pollutes the
humid air.  A round, brick-lined shaft leads upwards out of the passage here,
an iron ladder providing access to a blank metal grate.  The ladder, shiny
at the top, gets progressively more rusty and grimy as it descends, becoming
filthy at the bottom.

A Filth Pit~
This round pit is walled in what might be brick; with the incredible
amounts of exrescence coating the wall and floor, it is impossible to tell. 
The filth is several feet deep here, a muddy, thick sludge of the waste of
hundreds of citizens mixed with old food, animal droppings, and other
unmentionables.  Whether this was a planned refuse pit or merely a severely
clogged access shaft is unclear; either way, the stench is incredible.  The
shaft tapers slightly overhead, narrowing to a manhole-sized opening at the
top of a ladder which crawls its laborious way out of the muck and up the
side of the shaft.

A Warm, Dry Lair~
The cold, wet sewer tunnel turns slightly upwards here, and dead-ends in
a small alcove.  The stone here is decidedly less filthy than other
sections, and the walls and floor show concerted efforts of some manner of
cleaning.  The ceiling above is formed to be of laid granite blocks - this
alcove seems to crouch directly under the foundation of one of the
buildings.  Old, torn blankets are gathered in lumpy piles on the floor,
each appearing to have been used recently as a bed.  A small set of shelves
lean drunkenly in one corner.  The air is somehow warmer here, perhaps due
to the gurgling pipe which snakes across the ceiling and disappears up into
the foundation.  The walls are kept almost entirely free of damp, care taken
to securely plug any chinks or holes in the stone.  A pair of smoking
torches have been affixed to the walls here, filling the area with
tempermental yellow light.

The End of a Narrow Sewer~
Filth and grime stain the rough grey stone walls of this tunnel under
the city.  Though tall enough for an alatharyan, the passage beneath the
streets is quite narrow.  A thick layer of mud and muck covers the floor,
forming small pools before meandering through the accumulated waste towards
the circular chute which lies in the center of the room.  A rusty iron
ladder extends downward through the chute, leading down into the darkness
below.  Thin trickles of putrid water issue from the smaller pipes which
empty into the tunnel, forming fetid pools amidst the mud.  The foul stench
of raw sewage and decay clogs the air, and the faint sounds of dripping
water echo against the tunnel walls.  The tunnel comes to an end here,
though it continues to the east, from whence a steady stream of water seems

Muddy Chute to Aklaju~
Thick layers of muck and grime coat the walls of this rough stone tunnel.
In the floor beneath you, a thin, cramped pipe leads down a sharp incline
into a mud-encrusted chute.  The sides of the pipe are slick with streaked
filth, and a corroded, rusty ladder leads down into the bowels of the
sewers.  The rich scents of sewage and decay clog the air, and the faint
sounds of dripping water echo against the walls of the tunnel.  To the

North End of Catwalk~
The filth- and grime-stained rough stone walls of this tunnel open here
into one of the city\@s main drains.  The thick flow of putrid sludge flows
out through the sewer from the west spatters down into the drain below.  Mud
and slime are even thicker on the walls of the drain, and the strong stench
of sewage and rot thickens the humid air.  The sounds of falling water drift
up from below, punctuated by drips and and wet splashes.  A thin iron
catwalk is bolted to the side of the drain, heading south over the tunnel
which the drain feeds into.  To the east, a round pipe of the same diameter
stretches into darkness, a small, steady stream of filth dribbling down to
the drain below.  An iron ladder leads down through a hole in the catwalk,
the rungs so encrusted with excrement as to be difficult to see.

A Rusty Catwalk Above a Conduit~
This catwalk passes north and south over a large conduit which receives
all of the waste for the entire city quadrant.  Covered in rust and slime,
the iron catwalk seems ready to pull away from the wall at any moment, so
corroded is the ancient framework.  There is no way down into the conduit
below here, except by jumping.  The wall of the drain is coated with mud and
grime, and glutinous trickles of putrid muck flow down the walls from the
smaller pipes and channels which empty into the drain.  Many larger pipes
also empty out into this overflow, close-barred grates covering the
apertures.  The strong stench of sewage and rot hangs heavy in the humid
air, and the sound of gurgling sewage filters up to you.

Crumbling grey masonry form the walls of the large tunnel which empties

A Round Sewer~
The filth- and grime-stained rough stone walls of this tunnel widen here,
opening into one of the city\@s main drains to the east.  The thick flow of
putrid sludge flows slowly from the west, picking up speed as the incline
steepens to the east before spattering over the edge.  Mud and slime are
thick on the walls, and the strong stench of sewage and rot thickens the

A Clay-Coated Stone Pipe~
This round, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage.  The
stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe humidity.  Rough stone blocks form
the walls of a pipe seven feet in diameter which flows from west to north
here.  The stone struggles for dominance with the sticky yellow clay which
seems to ooze from every gap, and which becomes even thicker to the east.  A
wide runnel is flanked by two narrow stone walkways, filled with several
inches of scummy, gloopy waste.  Smaller grooves emerge from the walls to
join with the larger at regular intervals, feeding waste into the
slowly-moving, glutinous scum which fills the runnel.

pipes which sprout from floor to ceiling.  The pipes are many differing
sizes, though all seem to be made of a flaking, rusted iron.  A few small
pipes open out on the walls of the room, pouring out streaks of greasy,
gummy sewage.  The floor is covered with several inches of the sloshing,
reeking waste which flows slowly through a small pipe southwards.  To the
west, a narrow aperture in the wall is blocked by a door, the ancient wood
yellow with a sickly, slick moss.  A round iron ring is attached to the door
at midheight, the metal nearly corroded away.

wide, the cramped hallway is relatively dry, though the rough grey blocks
perspire a constant dew of moisture which mingles with the dirt of ages.  A
rough stone floor slants slightly to a small vee-shaped depression, allowing
a tiny trickle of moisture to run down and under the swollen, ancient wood
door to the east.  To the west, the tunnel opens into a cramped room.  An
iron grate roughly three feet in diameter stands in the middle of the

Stacks of boxes and broken crates line the rough stone walls of this
small room.  This room, a node at the junction of three small pipes, has
been cleaned and converted into some sort of living space.  The pipes have
been tightly plugged by small cloth-wrapped casks hammered into the
openings, blocking the inflow of sewage.  A long, almost coffinlike, box
lined with dirty straw lies against one wall, a man-shaped depression
nestled into the straw from long use.  A battered iron stove, cobbled
together with scraps of pipe and beaten tin, stands in a corner.  Unwashed
rags of clothing and other detritus of residence lies scattered about the
ground.  The scent of rot and raw sewage lingers heavily in the room, mixed
with the smell of wet animals and the subtle, coppery tang of blood.  A
small doorway leads east into a narrow passage.  The floor is relatively
clean, sand and bits of sawdust strewn about to absorb moisture.

A Series of Clay-Walled Passages~
This narrow, dark passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage and the
earthy smell of wet mud.  Stiflingly heavy air is thick with a ripe
humidity.  Sticky yellow clay covers every surface thickly, the earth
glistening wet.  The tunnel begins to curve erratically, splitting and
rejoining itself apparently at random.  Smaller passages and tunnels sprout
with no direction or order, narrow holes of varying depth and width boring
off into the walls and ceiling.  A shallow runnel follows along, clogged
with a mixture of foul sewage and muddy clay.  Glutinous scum oozes from the
clay at various points, slipping down the slick walls and mingling with the
gloppy mass which covers the floor.

An Overflow Pipe~
This round tunnel is about nine feet in circumference, the mostly smooth
walls a slightly reflective grey; however, as they are coated with a crust
of muck, whether the tunnel is crafted of metal or stone is uncertain.  Two
narrow walkways, each about a foot and a half wide, abut the curvature of
the walls roughly three feet from the bottom of the pipe.  Flanked by these
curbs is a broad, deep channel, designed to deal with vast amounts of water
in the event of an overflow in the sewers.  The few scummy inches of thick,
glutinous waste in the bottom of the channel emits a horrific stench, moving
slowly down the east-to-west gradient.  Smaller pipes join the larger at
regular intervals, the walls even more stained from the constant trickling
outflow.  The tunnel vanishes into darkness in either direction, the air
humid and rank.

moving slowly down the east-to-west gradient.  The massive pipe ends here,
opening into a small, cubical room to the east.  From this room flows the
slow current of sludge, added to by the many smaller pipes feeding into the
channel.

but still quite sturdy, allow the waste to flow in, but prevent all other
exit or entrance from the side pipes.

A Junction in an Overflow Pipe~
This round tunnel is about nine feet in circumference, the mostly smooth
walls a slightly reflective grey however, as they are coated with a crust of
muck, whether the tunnel is crafted of metal or stone is uncertain.  Two
narrow walkways, each about a foot and a half wide, flank a broad, deep
channel, designed to deal with vast amounts of water in the event of an
overflow.  The few scummy inches of thick, glutinous waste in the bottom of
the channel emits a horrific stench, moving slowly down the south-to-north
gradient.  The tunnel ends in a cubical chamber, where is it is joined by
several large pipes, each roughly half the size of the one you are in. 
Close-barred grates, rusted and encrusted with sewage but still quite
sturdy, allow the waste to flow in, but prevent all other exit or entrance
from the side pipes.  To the north, the pipe continues into darkness.

The Bottom of an Overflow Conduit~
This large conduit receives all of the waste for the entire city
quadrant.  Covered in rust and slime, the iron catwalk overhead seems ready
to pull away from the wall at any moment.  The wall of the drain is coated
with mud and grime, and glutinous trickles of putrid muck flow down the
walls from the smaller pipes and channels which empty into the drain.  Many
larger pipes also empty out into this overflow, close-barred grates covering
the apertures.  Two significantly larger pipes above are unbarred, however,
and from these two pour large twin streams of muck which fall through a
feeble fitration grate before splashing into the channel.  The waste is
several feet deep at the bottom of the conduit, though only a few inches at
the edges.  The strong stench of filth and rot hangs heavy in the humid air,
and the sound of gurgling sewage is all around you.  High above, a vaulted
stone ceiling is murkily visible in the wretchedly smelly dark.

A Descending, Muddy Passage~
This large tunnel runs in a steady decline to the south.  The walls of
the tunnel in many places nothing but mud, and appear to be of an older
construction than the tunnels to the north.  While the foul miasma of the
sewers still persists here, it is obvious that these tunnels have not been
used for many years.  The filthy water covers the floor here, stagnant,
though the old watermarks on the sides show that these tunnels were once far
more active.  Occasional pieces of debris and garbage can still be seen
floating within the brownish waters.  To the south this branch tunnel
continues, while to the north the tunnel climbs a steady incline.

A Tiny Side Passage~
This narrow, tiny passage is filled with the reek of raw sewage and the
earthy smell of wet mud.  Incredibly cramped, sticky yellow clay presses in
all around you.  A tiny crevice yawns in the western wall.  Patches of rough
stone show through in places, the grey stone bare and unremarkable.  A
shallow runnel follows along, clogged with a mixture of foul sewage and
muddy clay.  The runnel flows down into a small, square hole, splashing into
an ancient metal chute.  Glutinous scum oozes from the clay at various
points, slipping down the slick walls and mingling with the gloppy mass
which covers the floor.

A Meandering, Decrepit Sewer~
Filth and grime stain the corroded metal walls of this pipe under the
city.  Ancient and flaking away in rusty shingles, the metal is almost
spongy in places.  Five feet in diameter, the conduit is coated in a layer
of mud and muck.  Thin trickles of putrid water issue from the smaller pipes
which empty into the tunnel, forming fetid pools amidst the waste.  The foul
stench of raw sewage and decay clogs the air, and the faint sounds of
dripping water echo against the tunnel walls.  The ancient pipe joins with a
larger conduit to the north, and wends its way south, zigzagging slightly
down a gentle decline.

around the edges of the hole, but the passage is unobstructed.  Narrow,

A Crumbling Brick Tunnel~
This round tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, walled with crumbling,
dull-orange brick so eroded and crumbled with age that it seems a miracle
the tunnel is still clear.  Coated with a layer of transparent slime, the
tunnel climbs slightly to the west, where it narrows into an equally
corroded metal conduit.  The conduit curves sharply upwards, with several
inset handholds allowing passage up through the pipe.  Eastwards, it
descends down a gentle slope eastward before vanishing into blackness.  The
air here is humid, dank, and still, and seems to grow rather flat and stale
as the tunnel descends.  Thick with the reek of sewage, the tunnel is dark
and close.  Sounds of dripping water echo dully through the decrepit
tunnels, and the footing underneath seems shifty and uncertain in the thick
muck.

A Vaulted Stone Tunnel~
This tall, vaulted stone tunnel ends at the western extreme with a
massive, close-barred iron grate.  The metal is encrusted with grime and
muck, and a small hinged section of the bars allows passage through. 
Through the grate, a filthy room can be seen, an iron catwalk running above
a large pool of excrescence.  Two wide, oiled grooves in the walls sit snug
up against this side of the grate.  In the ceiling above, a large strip of
metal runs between the tops of the two grooves.  The tall granite walls and
ceiling of this room are surprisingly clean, the stone free of any trace of
grime or filth.  Though the floor is covered with over a foot of glutinous,
slimy waste and the air reeks with the stagnating excrement, the rest of the
vaulted tunnel has somehow remained free of befoulment.  The wide tunnel
stretches away to the east, the walls conspicuously blank of any other pipes
or grates.

leading through a dark, rusty metal chute which smells faintly of sewage. 
The sound of splattering, splashing filth filters faintly down from above,
but oddly, none of the muck seems to fall through the opening.  The shaft
opens at the bottom into a dark stone room, dimly lit by a greasy yellow,
inconstant light which flickers down the open hallway which stretches east. 
The air here is dry and smells of cold earth, chilly and dusty.

runs north-to-south, but turns westward here at the northern extreme.  A
small, corbelled ledge in the northern wall supports a crude earthenware
dish filled with liquid tallow, in which floats a twist of smokily-burning
cloth.  Westward, the passage fades in the half-light, but seems to come to
an end several paces down.  Southwards, the hall passes between a pair of
doors and continues on its way.  The air is dry and chill, smelling of dust
and cold earth.  The ceiling is a dirty, whitewashed mortar of some sort,
and the floor made from cheap, slightly uneven flagstones.

is decidedly chilly, and traces of damp show around the corners.  Several
large crates stand empty at the back of the room, and three moth- and
rat-eaten bolts of cheap burlap lean against a wall.  A stack of pig iron
rusts slowly in one corner, the massive iron ingots corroding into one,

though raising the temperature noticeably.  A threadbare rug of faded red
wool covers most of the floor here, looking forlorn and depressingly thin. 
Three small wooden chairs sit huddled around the brazier, and a long table
sits against the southern wall.  A small shelf above holds a few cracked
jars and limp flour sacks.  Crumbs litter the table, and several bits of old
bones of various food animals lie about, tossed carelessly away.

A rusty iron ladder extends downward through this dark, rusty metal

sewage is strong in the air, but seems to diminish below.  The sound of
splattering, splashing filth filters down from above, but oddly, none of the
muck seems to make it to this point in the chute.  The shaft leads down,
opening into a dim room.  The space below seems partially lit by a greasy
yellow, inconstant light.  The air seems to be layered here; the air from
above is wet and humid, laden with the reek of filth, whereas that from
below is much drier, smelling of cold earth.

A Sloping, Tapering Drain~
This huge drain of a room is shaped like an enormous funnel.  The western
end is nearly fourteen feet in diameter, fed by a comparatively tiny sliver
of drain in the bottom of the wall.  A heavy iron hatch leads westward,
accessed by a short iron ladder.  The metal sides of this drain are coated
with a thick, gelatinous scum of an evil-looking green.  Tapering sharply
downwards to the east, the funnel ends at its eastern extremity in a hinged
grate which opens out into the roof of some large stone tunnel.  The sides
are utterly smooth and slick, and any earthbound being would be hard pressed
not to slide instantly down the slick tube.  A constant flow of thick,
gloppy sewage gurgles in from the west, skimming down into the stone tunnel
eastward.

A Small Crawlspace~
This low stone tunnel is cramped and narrow.  Though apparently only a
connecting passage for maintenance, it does not seem as if anyone has ever
maintained anything in this section of sewer.  The walls are made of
roughly-carved grey stone which seems to be constantly filmed with a sheen
of condensation made grubby with the dirt of decades.  About an inch of
foul, stagnant water sloshes on the floor here, filling the air with the
pungent reek of sewage.  Small iron grates stand at either end of the
passage which runs almost exactly from north to south.  A small metal wheel
protrudes from the wall beside the southern grate.

undisturbed nature of the filth to either side of the channel.  Smaller,
grooved channels emerge from the walls to join with the larger at regular
intervals, feeding waste into the slowly-moving, glutinous scum which fills
the runnel.  At the bend in the tunnel, large clumps of semisolid

rotting and dank.  The low ceiling is a rough, pebbly mortar, and seems to

into the soft brick, filling the room with smoky, flickering light.  A short
hallway leads to a door to the south, and the room opens up to the east and

A Crumbling Ledge Above the Murk~
The ancient, dull-orange brick walls of this chamber are warped and
bowed, forming an amorphous, dank room, into which three tunnels lead.  A
wide, mud-covered ledge of uneven brick sits just above the surface of the
cloudy, greenish-grey pool of sludgy water which covers the rest of the
floor.  A pair of empty metal torch-sconces, heavily corroded with time,
flank a set of iron rungs that lead upward through a once-round hole in the
ceiling.  The crumbling brick walls are caked with centuries of grime and
muck, disappearing beneath the nearly opaque water.  The air is stale and
heavy, thick with the churning reek of stagnant sewage.  Two tunnels,
half-filled with the disgusting water, lead off to the north and east.

This tunnel is entirely filled with a thick, murky fluid which renders
vision rather difficult.  The greyish-green water is filthy and heavy with
centuries of accumulated waste.  The walls of the tunnel, mostly obscured by
untold years of sitting beneath stagnant water, are coated in a thick layer
of a dark, slimy substance.  The curving walls dip down in the center of
this area, then angle slowly to the north and south, climbing out of the
near-opaque water and allowing for somewhat drier passage.

A square passage leads upwards at the southern end of the tunnel, here, a

the dully-glazed brown blocks give way to far older, crumbling orange-tinged
ones.  The floor of the tunnel is hidden by several inches of squelchy,
reeking mud.  The air is stale and humid, thick with the stench of stagnant
sewage and an older, earthier smell.  The tunnel walls begin to bow slightly
inwards as the passage dips below the surface of the cloudy, greenish-grey
water which fills the tunnel to the north.

here.  The slimy muck which covers every surface begrudgingly allows the
orange-brown brick to peep through in a few small places.  A slender stream
of the cloudy, muddy water follows the curve of the tunnel to the north and
east.  The dark, cramped tunnel is thick with the stench of stagnating
sewage, the air calm and stale.  Occasional drips of moisture fall
disconsolately into the layer of muck covering the floor.

A Salt-Encrusted, Sloping Tunnel~
The walls of this wide tunnel are made of lime-covered stones, laid
unevenly long ago in a gentle slope down from east to west.  Unused for
generations, the circular tube has begun to crumble and collapse in places,
leaving a thick layer of salts and debris along the damp floor.  The entire
space is infused with a pungent, damp odor that hangs thickly in the room,
making what remains of the air rather difficult to breathe.  The tunnel
branches three ways here, heading through a water-filled dip into a large
chamber to the west, a smaller chamber to the south, and continues up the
gentle gradient eastward.

This round, cylindrical chamber is walled in crumbling, dull orange

rotted sewage and waste, in places so ancient and decayed as to be more rich
black soil than true filth.  The stench is incredible, however, the reek of

This tunnel is entirely filled with a thick, murky fluid which renders

centuries of accumulated waste.  The walls of the tunnel, mostly obscured by
untold years of sitting beneath stagnant water, are coated in a thick layer
of a dark, slimy substance.  The curving walls dip down in the center of

The watery murk fills the tunnel about three feet from its deepest point,

coated in a thick, flaking substance of a greenish-black hue.  The ground
too is covered with the thick layer of murky grime, and the strong stench of
old waste fills the stale air.  A thin trickle of fluid runs in from the
east, dribbling into a greenish-grey pool of water which has pooled in the
bottom of the crater-like floor.  To the west, a broken section of the wall
reveals a tiny, low tunnel which tapers through the muddy earth.  Forking
south- and east-ward out of the chamber is an uneven, ovoid passage dripping
with damp.  To the north, another gap in the wall has formed, several

point.  Several scratch marks are evident in the soft stone walls, each long
set of gouges grouped in fours.  The floor is almost completely obscured

of the chamber.  The clayey mud is studded with bits of broken brick and
limestone.  A gap climbs over a small cave-in of stones southward, into a

A Foul Tunnel~
This round, dark tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, filled over
halfway with thick, sludgy water of a semi-opaque greenish-grey hue.  The
crumbling, dull-orange brick walls of the tunnel are eroded and falling
apart with age.  In places the ancient bricks and mortar have given away
completely, small piles of mud marking the final resting places of the
fallen bricks.  The tunnel rises slightly out of the water to the west and
south, and continues through the deepening water to the the north. 
Northward, the circular passage seems to taper into a caved-in dead end. 
The air here is humid, dank, and still, so stale as to be almost drained of
its life-sustaining properties.

A Murk-Filled Dead End~
This round, dark tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, filled almost to
the descending ceiling with thick, sludgy water of a semi-opaque
greenish-grey hue.  The crumbling, dull-orange brick walls of the tunnel are
eroded and falling apart with age.  In places the ancient bricks and mortar
have given away completely, small piles of mud marking the final resting
places of the fallen bricks.  A small patch of moss has managed to grow on
the western wall.  The abandoned sewer has crumbled completely here, a pile
of mud, clay , stones, and broken bricks completely forbidding any further
progress north.  The tunnel rises slightly out of the water to the south,
the only visible exit from this cramped space.  The air here is humid, dank,
and still, so stale as to be almost drained of its life-sustaining
properties.

This sickly patch of yellowish-white moss clings morosely to a relatively

A Close, Round Tunnel~
This round tunnel is roughly six feet in diameter, filled with about two
feet of thick, sludgy water, a semi-opaque unpleasant greenish-grey.  The
crumbling, dull-orange brick walls of the tunnel are eroded and falling
apart with age, coated with a layer of transparent slime.  The tunnel sinks
almost completely under the water to the east, and continues through the
knee-deep water to the the south.  Northwards, the round passage seems to
climb completely out of the filthy water.  The air here is humid, dank, and
still, so stale as to be almost spent of its life-sustaining properties.
