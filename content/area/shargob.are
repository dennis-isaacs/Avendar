Crab Bot Crabbot~
the Crab Bot~
A spawnerbot is here. It looks like a real wimp
~
This region is nestled between the crook of the Yagash mountains to the west, and a small plateau
which rises imemdiately southward. Gazing upward, you can make out some sort of structure atop
the plateau, but no trail provides a way to ascend to the top leve of the plateau. The soil is more rocky here, and less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob, which skirt the base of the plateau to the east.

Terror Creature Night~
the night terror~
The Night terror skitters about the plains.
~
Clouded in a fog of darkness, the night terror clicks as it skitters
along the plains.  Barely visible in the dim lighting, a chill draft follows
its progress.

a pale crab~
A pale gray crab sidles its way through the plains.
~
This pale crustacean sidles its way through the plains, weaving its way
in and out of the small rocks of Shargob.  Pale feelers twitch as its scans
the contents of the room, its pincers snapping hungrily.

the maglat~
The maglat\@s tendrils writhe hungrily as they fill the room.
~
An enormous bundle of thick tendrils surrounds the central jaws of the
maglat.  Gummy secretions coat the floor near it, where its central location
provides easy digestion of those who are drawn through the trap ceiling
directly above it.

ancient templar Elieth~
Elieth~
An ancient templar sits cross-legged on the ground.
~
This human is exceptionally tall, towering over six and a half feet. 
Rail-thin, his bones stand out prominently, from his gaunt chest to his
sallow cheeks.  His attire is especially humble; his upper body is bare, and
unevenly stitched hide leggings cover much of the rest.  His hair is matted
and grey, long enough to reach his narrow waist.  Despite his unsettling
appearance, his shining eyes are keen, alert, and devastating in their
intensity-- lit with an eerie blue light that knows not the passing of ages.

A massive, vaguely insectoid abomination of chitin plates and sharp,

armor gleams dully in the dim light, and as it shifts slightly, a horrible
clattering emanates from the pile of joints and sharp edges.  An unearthly

The ax\@niara is a weapon design with a storied legacy amongst the ancient
ch\@taren.  However, in the modern age, it is specifically associated with
the devoted of Calaera-- who draw upon both Her power and their own inner
strength to create it.  The most powerful of these weapons can only be
called forth by those of immense favor with the Ishia, and only then may
they be touched by other than Her chosen.

Rising nearly ten feet into the air, much of the obelisk seems to rest

cipher~
As you gaze, you recognize the script scored into the obelisk to be the
Lost Cipher of Pnakur.  It is difficult to extract any meaning from the
incredibly complex script that makes up the Lost Cipher of Pnakur.  Whatever
coherence or pattern that can be found from line to line, word to word, or
even character to character has been obliterated by someone or something
blotting out key portions, rendering the whole unintelligible.  

A sense of dark power seems to exude from the symbol.  Perhaps you could
learn more if you were to study it.

You gaze intently at the characters on the obelisk, attempting to divine
meaning from them.  As you struggle you find yourself no longer in the grey
plains of Shargob..  

All around you runes and writing whirl as you float suspended within them. 
The runes writhe and swirl, tearing at the edges of your sanity as you try
to understand the meaning of them.  

As you hang, you being to see order in the chaos.  Horrible, beautiful form.
The runes and glyphs suddenly make perfect sense, and for a single euphoric
moment, you KNOW.  Truth flows over you in a darkly triumphant wave.  

As you bask in the unholy truth about you, you feel your understanding
struck as if by a hammer.  A mental blow sends you reeling, striking the
blasphemous knowledge from your mind.  More follow, and what form you could
find in the swirling glyphs is lost.  The runes continue to scrape at your
sanity as you attempt understand, to regain the pure truth you once held to
no avail.  You feel the cords of sanity within your mind begin to snap and
pitch your head back in a sobbing moan..  

You suddenly jolt back into reality, the Lost Cipher of Pnakur scored into
your mind, with the vague sense you have..  Lost something.

The Edge of Shargob~
The bulk of the Qilarn forest begins to the north.  Off to the west loom
the steep peaks of the Yagashes, which run north and south along the edge of
the plains.  This particular area is still dominated by the features of the
Plains of Shargob -- the soil is an ashy gray clay, supporting little life
save a few pale, clinging fungi, which grow on the small rocks that lie here
and there.  The plains continue to skirt the forest to the east, while
southward the mountains shade the already dim cast of the plains.

The Edge of Shargob~
The barren plains of Shargob begin to recede here, coming to an end as
the bulk of the Qilarn forest begins to the north.  Further off to the west
loom the steep peaks of the Yagashes, framing the western region of Shargob.
This particular area is still dominated by the features of the Plains of
Shargob -- the soil is an ashy gray clay, supporting little life save a few
pale, clinging fungi, which grow on the small rocks that lie here and there.
The plains continue to skirt the forest to the east and west, but a small
trail leads through the growth of the forest to the north.  Southward, the
ashen cast of the plains becomes more oppressive, as the geography of the
edge fades into the featureless gray monotony of Shargob proper.

At the Base of the Yagashes~
The plains of Shargob begin to fade here, ashen gray soil gradually
changing into the stony browns and greys of more rocky terrain.  Almost
immediately west, the Yagash mountains begin their steep ascent, blocking
near fully half the sky.  Northward lies the bulk of the Qilarn forests, a
shock of green against the drabness of the plains.  To the south, the edge
of the plains skirt the Yagashes, while eastward lies more of the plains
proper.

At the Bottom of a Rise~
This region is nestled between the crook of the Yagash mountains to the
west, and a small plateau which rises immediately southward.  Gazing upward,
you can make out some sort of structure atop the plateau, but no trail
provides a way to ascend to the top level.  The soil is more rocky here, and
less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob, which skirt the base of
the plateau to the east.

is more rocky here, and less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob,

Near the End of an Ancient Road~
You are standing on what appears to have once been an ancient road.  Pale
grey stones are pounded into the earth here, the surface of the road still
smooth despite the surrounding desolation.  The road itself stretches
further east, an almost straight line across the barren plains of Shargob. 
The terrain is slightly less regular to the north and south, where the flat
stone of the road fades into a monotonous sea of small stones and
outcroppings rising above the ashy gray plains.  To the west, the road
begins to fade into obscurity as the plains approach the edge of the Yagash
mountains.  What remains of the road slopes up a small plateau to the west,
where you can make out the beginnings of some sort of ruins.

You are standing at a curve in what appears to have once been an ancient
road.  Pale grey stones are pounded into the earth here, the surface of the
road still smooth despite the surrounding desolation.  The terrain is
slightly less regular to the east and north, where the flat stone of the
road fades into a monotonous sea of small stones and outcroppings rising

stretches off in the distance to the west.

The Plains of Shargob~
The barren plains of Shargob stretch off in all directions here, open
space all about.  The soil here is an ashy gray clay, supporting little life
save a few pale, clinging fungi, which grow on the small rocks that lie here
and there.  The plains remain almost precisely the same in all directions.

Before a Ruined Gate~
This area is near the edge of a mid-sized plateau, which overlooks the
plains of Shargob to the east.  By far the most prevalent feature, though,
is the beginnings of what appear to be a ruined city to the west.  Most of
an exceptionally tall wall remains intact to the west, over which you can
see the occasional crumbling structure jutting into the sky.  A large gate
once led west, but a huge pile of rubble blocks the way west.  Northward,
part of the wall has collapsed, also impeding further travel with the huge
remains of stone blocks which stand in the way.  A small path follows the
walls of the city to the south, and a thin trail leads off the edge of the
plateau to the east, leading down to what appears to be a road of some kind.

At the Bottom of a Rise~
A plateau rises up gradually to the west of here, topped in a flat shelf.
Gazing upward, you can make out some sort of structure atop the plateau, but
no trail provides a way to ascend to the top level.  The soil is more rocky
here, and less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob, which lie
eastward.  The plains follow the edge of the plateau to a corner in the
south, while to the north there is evidence of a road of some sort.

At the Bottom of a Rise~
A plateau rises up gradually to the south of here, topped in a flat
shelf.  Gazing upward, you can make out some sort of structure atop the
plateau, but no trail provides a way to ascend to the top level.  The soil
is more rocky here, and less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob,
which lie south and east.  Off to the west the plains come to an end as the
Yagash mountains jut up sharply out of the plains.

Near the Corner of an Ancient City~
This area is near the edge of a mid-sized plateau, which overlooks the
plains of Shargob to the east.  By far the most prevalent feature, though,
is the beginnings of what appear to be a ruined city to the northwest.  Most
of an exceptionally tall wall remains intact to the northwest, over which
you can see the occasional crumbling structure jutting into the sky.  To the
north and west small trails skirt the area between the walls of the city and
the edge of the plateau.

At the Bottom of a Rise~
A plateau rises up gradually to the southwest of here, topped in a flat
shelf.  Gazing upward, you can make out some sort of structure atop the
plateau, but no trail provides a way to ascend to the top level.  The soil
is more rocky here, and less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob,
which lie south and east.  Off to the west the plains come to an end as the
Yagash mountains jut up sharply out of the plains, while the edge of the
plateau continues to the north.

The Plains of Shargob~
The barren plains of Shargob stretch off in all directions here, open
space all about.  The soil here is an ashy gray clay, supporting little life
save a few pale, clinging fungi, which grow on the small rocks that lie here
and there.  The plains remain almost precisely the same in all directions.

Beginning of a Crevasse~
The plains of Shargob give way suddenly here, as a crevasse splits the
surface of the hard clay ground.  A small trail leads downward into the
depths of the crevasse, from which a foul strench wafts into the air. 
Southward lies above the top of the crevasse, and the plains begin again to
the north, east, and west.

Above a Crevasse~
You fly above a crevasse here, a dark rift in the otherwise placid
surface of Shargob.  Looking downard, the area below the ground darkens
quickly, and a foul stench wafts upward into the sky.  You can fly over more
of the crevasse to the south, while the ground resumes to the east and west.
Northward lies the beginning of crevasse, a shallow fissure cut into the clay
ground of Shargob.

The Plains of Shargob~
The barren plains of Shargob stretch off in all directions here, open
space all about.  The soil here is an ashy gray clay, supporting little life
save a few pale, clinging fungi, which grow on the small rocks that lie here
and there.  The plains remain almost precisely the same in all directions.

Above a Crevasse~
You fly above a crevasse here, a dark rift in the otherwise placid
surface of Shargob.  Looking downard, the area below the ground darkens
quickly, and a foul stench wafts upward into the sky.  To the north lies
more of the crevasse, while the ground resumes in all other directions.

Entrance to the Crevasse~
Little light trickles into this crevasse, whose jagged walls prevent most
of the light from reaching the ground.  The walls of the crevasse are seem
blasted from the hard-baked clay of Shargob, giving the edges an almost
rock-like appearance.  A small set of handholds allows access out of the
crevasse upwards, while the floor slants slowly downward to the south. 
Wafting through the chamber is a sort of cloying stench, which seems to grow
stronger to the south.

Deeper in the Crevasse~
Deep into the crevasse, this area seems almost scooped out of the hard
clay walls, rather than naturally worn with time.  The floor is sandy with
ground bits of clay, and here and there bits and pieces of organic debris
litter the floor -- a bone here, shrivelled skin there, even bits of chitin.
A nauseating stench pervades the room, seeping into every crack and crevice,
filling everything with the foulness.  An exit from the chamber lies up some
handholds in the wall, or through a small crack to the south.  

Toward the center of the room, the disjointed cracks seem to take terrible
form.

symbolvision~
As you study the cracks, the cave walls about you seem to fade and you
find yourself upon an ashen grey plain.  

Extending endlessly with no landmarks in sight, the waste spreads in all
directions.  The earth lacks even the clinging fungi of the Shargob.  A low
humming fills the air, source indeterminate, and a duststorm seems to rage
in the horizon.  As you take in surroundings a horrible realization occurs
to you, although you know not where from- You are upon the plains of Xixzyr
bordering the barren Waste of Oame.  

You feel panic grip your heart as you search for escape in a futile effort. 
As you do so, you realize the humming has grown louder, becoming a maddening
buzz.  Looking again to the horizon you see the dust storm fast approaching,
but realize it is not sand that makes it, but countless demonic, stinging
insects.  

With a scream borne of purest terror, your turn and flee the swarm, the
buzzing growing loud in your ears.  The insects are quick in their pursuit,
however, and the swarm descends upon you with cruel abandon.  

Pain erupts in a thousand spots as stingers lance your flesh and you feel
your blood boil as foul, alien toxins run through your body.  You swat
blindly at the abominations, your vision lost, your vain effort seeming only
to encourage their torture.  You feel your strength ebb, and you crumple to
the ground in pain too exquisite to comprehend, seeking escape in death.  

You suddenly are back within the crevasse in Shargob, the Cracks of Xixzyr
etched in your mind.

xixzyr~
Violent, disjointed strokes seem to make some arcane figure within the
stone.  There are six jagged lines which form the main body of the symbol,
but numerous smaller geometric features jut off from the inscription like
angry breaks in the ground.  

The lines of the figure pulse with their own dark power.  Perhaps you could
learn more were you to study them.

A cramped hole carved deep within the grayish clay earth, this low hole

A narrow tunnel is dug through the grayish earth, apparently by some sort

A Stony Chamber~
The air in this chamber is very chill, and more stagnant than would seem
possible for even this crevasse.  Scooped out of the same gray clay as the
rest of the plains of Shargob, its walls are nevertheless encrusted with a
sort of black, rocky growth.  Arranged in a circle on the floor are more of
these rocks, which seem arranged by some crude hand to set them in their
place in the sand.  The only exit lies through a small crack in the wall to
the north.

A Trail in the Yagashes~
This thin trail ascends into the stony reaches of the Yagashes.  The
torturous path twists and turns through jagged spires of sharp rock, and
passes over treacherous gravel underfoot.  The trail continues its ascent to
the west, and heads downward to the plains of Shargob to the east.

End of a Trail in the Yagashes~
This thin trail comes to an end here, terminating in an abrupt drop to
the west.  Set amidst the sharp spires of the Yagashes, the trail is
relatively clear here, with the exception of a vertical slash in the wall of
the mountains to the north.  Lying on the ground, split in two, are the
pieces of a block of ancient silver, evidently designed to block entrance to
the northern cave.  The trail descends to the east, passing into rougher
terrain.

A Cavernous Chamber~
This cavernous chamber shows signs of long use.  A variety of hide rugs
lie on the floor, haphazardly strewn amidst piles of old rags.  A huge
stalactite descends from the center of the ceiling, tapering to a narrow
point.  Water drips, ever so slowly, from the jagged tip of the stalactite,
falling into a small stone basin.  They only exit from the chamber is to the
south, where a jagged opening allows light to filter into the chamber.

At the Bottom of a Rise~
This region is nestled between the crook of the Yagash mountains to the
west, and a small plateau which rises immediately northward.  Gazing upward,
you can make out some sort of structure atop the plateau, but no trail
provides a way to ascend to the top level.  The soil is more rocky here, and
less reminiscent of the other portions of Shargob, which skirt the base of
