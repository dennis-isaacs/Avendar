dyurjan yithoul inferno master shuddeni fire scholar~
Dyurjan~
The Inferno Master stands near the furnace, arms folded.
~
A tall and gaunt figure, Dyurjan the Inferno Master stands very near the
forge, the radiant heat seeming to have no effect upon him.  The wrinkled
and ash-gray flesh of the elderly shuddeni is pulled tight across his face,
burn scar contractures drawing back lips from his teeth and angling his jaw,
making his features as twistedly demonic as any voidspawn.  The greatest
fire scholar of the Yithoul Sept, and unusually long-lived for one who
pursues the fire arts, Dyurjan now proves the mettle of acolytes who would
also stoke their greed, sadism, and lust for power by embracing the flame. 
The Forge of Yithoul is his preferred place for lessons in the arts of fire.

Since deposing the previous Inferno Master, Dyurjan\@s lash has burned across
many in Yithoul.  While he lacks the ultimate social power of the Void
Priests, he is no less feared throughout the Sept.  Few chaja, in
particular, are likely to forget an encounter with the old scholar and his
flaming lash.

a chaja guard~
A burly chaja guard stands near the wall.
~
This 8\@ tall gray-skinned chaja guard has long, grease-coated black hair.
Milky white eyes are set back into his skull, above his fang-toothed mouth. 
He is thickly muscled, and dressed in little better than rags, but appears
formidable nonetheless.

a void drake~
A void drake lies coiled on the bier.
~
The serpentine body of this black-scaled drake stands some twelve feet
tall when reared on its hind legs, some twenty feet long from snout to tail.
The creature\@s long, narrow beak reveals a maw arrayed with row upon row of
razor teeth.  Its slender, forward limbs are wrapped in corded muscle and
tipped with four vicious, rending claws on each scaly hand.  The drake\@s
prehensile tail is particularly cruel, barbed at the tip and coated in
viscous poison.  Its eyes are pools of inky blackness, and a deathly chill
rises from its massive wings.

A wiry, long-fingered shuddeni, Ijjara of the clan of Reshka spent many
years on the surface plying his trade, selling his intricate works in
Earendam to others of the people.  With the political rise of certain
figures in that city, Ijjara found it more prudent to return to Yithoul
where he staged a bloody coup, taking ascendancy as elder of his clan at an
unusually young age.  He has returned to his work here, and has gained a
modicum of fame for his intricate metalwork and masterful gem-cutting

An elder matron of Yithoul reclines on a padded cushion near the pit edge.
~
Ajekure Jjita, one of the more influential elders of Yithoul society, is
wrapped in fine black silks.  She contemplates the activities of the arena
around her imperiously.  With her position as the overseer of the Yithoul
arena, other shuddeni roundabout give her a wide berth, lest they give some
minor offence and end up down in the pits with the chaja gladiators.  Her
reputation for keeping the arena filled is only second that of her keeping
its combatants in the pit where they belong.  Like an empress on a throne,
she reclines on the softest of cushions near the edge of the arena seating. 
The labyrinthine wrinkles of her old, pallid flesh are carefully oiled, and
around her the scents of the oil, blood, and chaja sweat mingle in the air.

This wide bangle is of a crimson gold, heavy and cumbersome enough to

This robe is made from a silken fabric, knitted rather than woven.  The
colour is variegated all over from hand-dyeing, and the tension of the
knitting varies all over, loose enough to poke fingers through in some
places, stiff and tight elsewhere.  The overall result is a highly-textured
garment, smooth from the silk but imparting a diverse feeling all over when

A traditional shuddeni garment, the head-wrap is much akin to the hats
worn by the surface peoples.  Wrapped round and round the head, the long
fringes drape over the head and face in ways that would interfere any but a
shuddeni; wrapped correctly, only the face from the top of the nose down and
the ears are left exposed.

lace pattern seems somewhat evocative of flames and the colour seems
well-matched to it, variegating from red through to yellow.

gloves fingerless golden gold leather pale chtarenleather madefromrealkidsamirite~
a golden pair of fingerless gloves~
A pair of fingerless gloves, expertly made out of a golden-pale leather sits here.~
Shuddeni are known to favour fingerless gloves for both casual and formal
wear, only generally wearing full gloves where rare physical work requires
it.  They prefer the style as it leaves their fingers exposed, not muting
sensation which appeals to their tactile nature.  The embroidery on the
palms of these gloves appear to be strictly decorative and more for the
benefit of the wearer than anything else; the raised pattern on the inside
has an appealing feel to their odd senses.  

As with many shuddeni leather goods aimed at their upper classes, the
leather is undoubtedly ch\@taren, and by both the thinness of the material
and its suppleness, you surmise it must have come from a very young one at
that.

These pants are made of an extremely finely-woven, translucently filmy

a hint of concealment is the extremely-finely embroidered design, a motif of
a shuddeni beating a cowering, tiny ch\@taren.  Modesty, however, to any but
a shuddeni\@s standards, is sorely lacking.

a short, golden leather vest~
A short vest made of supple golden leather and studded with obsidian is here.~
Shuddeni enjoy a certain degree of exposure in their garments, and this
one is no exception.  It is intentionally short, eschewing a more typical
modesty for a manner of perverse titillation.  The obsidian studs are sharp
enough to subtly appeal to the shuddeni love for pain; even their own.  The
pattern on the back of the vest is a stylized version of the classical
Dragon\@s claw, a popular item of shuddeni worship.  

As with many shuddeni leather goods aimed at upper classes, the leather is
undoubtedly ch\@taren.  Its thickness and size suggest that it came from a
mature one, due to the lack of excess stitching and fullness of the vest\@s
expanse.

a pair of tight, golden leather pants~
A pair of tightly-stitched leather pants are here, studded with obsidian.~
Shuddeni often ignore the conventions of other races in terms of modesty,
and these pants are no exception.  Their tight, revealing nature would be
utterly scandalous to some, and even moreso with its suggestive studding. 
The sense of constriction is one that shuddeni often deeply appreciate, and
these pants were surely designed to appeal to that aesthetic.  The
spider-web pattern is a common motif of Yithoul, as close as it is to the
domain of giant spiders.  

As with many shuddeni leather goods aimed at upper classes, the leather is
undoubtedly ch\@taren.  Its thickness and size suggest that it came from a
mature one, due to the length of the leather needed.  However, given subtle
tonal differences in front and back, it may have come from two separate
bodies.

thighs in front and back.  A thin spider-web pattern traces over much of the

Often given over to grotesque flamboyance as much as stealth, the heels
of these boots are as hard as they are in order to better announce the
wearer\@s coming as they walk on hard cavern floors.  

As with many leather goods made for shuddeni upper classes, the boots are
almost certainly made from ch\@taren leather.  This style of boots seems to
go one further, however; the laces appear to be a treated lock of ch\@taren
hair, and the distinctly translucent heel has more the look of ch\@taren bone
than real crystal.

I recommend that if you are to escort the shipment of potions to our
conclave in the northern caverns, you bring sufficient protection.  I
understand that a clutch of kkhilgh has taken to guarding the tunnels, and
wild chaja have been sighted there as well.  

In addition, we all know that our ..  Friends..  Here in the city have a
vested interest in seeing that our little venture does not succeed.  I think
more than simple chaja guards may be required, particularly if they turn at
the sight of wild chaja.  

I recommend summoning one of Khamurn\@s syndics.  You will need silver
powder, the traditional sign, and time to prepare for the greater ritual. 
You should have enough gold for the payment, especially after our profits on
the sale of the gems.  

I cannot stress enough the need for discretion.  If our side operations are
discovered, I doubt will the high priest will look with favor on not
including the temple on any of our potential profits.

The Great Ghal\@koth Worm:

Quick travel is assured to the void scholar who possesses the power to
summon this greater demon.  An unwholesome, multi-segmented aberration, the
worm typically burrows through the fine structure of the void, tearing space
and time in its path.  

When summoned to Avendar, the worm can eat through space, connecting any two
suitable points in the world by a tunnel through the void.  Care must be
taken not to watch the actual digestion of space in time and progress, for
madness is a real risk in the case of the Ghal\@Koth.  

Summoning the demon requires that the greater ritual be performed over a
collection of bitterthorn vine, smeared into the sign of the Cracks of
Xixzyr.  The worm will be hungry from its interplanar journey when it
arrives, and must be fed the heart of a celestial being to \@encourage\@ it to

Overlooking the Shuddeni City~
The tunnel widens into a broad ledge overlooking an enormous cavern.  The
open area that spreads before you is so large that the curving walls and far
side are lost in darkness.  Below the ledge, a multitude of shuddeni move
about between various structures.  Dominating the cavern is a building of
onyx, some sort of temple by appearance.  A stairway is carved in the stone
walls of the cavern, offering a path down to the city.

The flat surface of the cavern floor is interrupted by the shuddeni
priests\@ theater of execution.  A 4\@ semi-circular pit is dug into the stone
floor, with curving steps leading down to the seating area.  Against the
cavern wall to the west, a large iron rack holds prisoners still for the
enormous weighted blade, set on oiled tracks to sever one\@s head cleanly. 
Beneath the rack, drains have been carved into the stone for the disposal of
blood.

west.  The stone has been worn smooth by centuries of pedestrians, and deep
grooves mark the most travelled paths.  In the distance, the black walls of
the Temple of Yithoul rise menacingly.

The North Wall of the Yithoul Cavern~
The northeastern corner of the cavern wall curves upwards, soon lost in

The Water Control Room~
This room, carefully carved out of the stone of the cave wall, is
remarkable for the fact that a medium-sized river flows through it in
mid-air.  The shuddeni priests have employed their magic arts to control the
water, and use this system to send it wherever it is needed throughout their
city.  This room is used to maintain their control over the flow, and as a

The Slave Pit~
A rope ladder descends from the cavern floor into a fetid, offal-coated
pit.  It is to this awful fate that the slaves of the shuddeni are
consigned.  Numerous slaves are packed into this low, narrow tunnel, forced
to wait their turn on the labor teams or the sacrificial altars.  The stench
is overpowering, intensified by the lack of ventilation.  The walls of the
pit are jagged stone, and when the slave population swells the protrusions
become deadly hazards.

Entrance to the City of Yithoul~
A stone stairway, carved into the west wall of this enormous cavern,
leads upward to a broad ledge overhead.  To the east, the cave spreads
massively, the walls curving into darkness.  Filling this space is the city
of Yithoul, the home of the Yithoul tribe of the shuddeni.  In the center of
the city, to the northwest, is the imposing black Temple of Yithoul, where
the fearsome shuddeni priests perform their obscene rites.

The Yithoul Forge~
The tunnel containing the Yithoul Weaponry continues into the stone wall,
then widens into the Yithoul Forge.  Half-shaped pieces of metal lean
against the wall or lie on the floor, and various smith\@s hammers and tongs
are stored in one corner.  A red glow comes from the north wall, where a
furnace has been carved into the stone.  Its roughly shaped opening emits a
bright reddish-orange light, and intense heat pours forth, heating the very
floor and walls of the tunnel.

The Yithoul Weaponry~
A large tunnel bored into the wall of the Yithoul Cavern opens to reveal
a weaponsmith\@s workplace.  Low stone blocks used as worktables hold weapon
hilts and half-finished blades, and weaponcases carved from wood lie empty
on the floor.  To the west is the red glow of a forge.

A Hidden Chamber~
A narrow opening has been carved into the north wall of the shuddeni
dwelling, leading to a small storage chamber.  The bare stone surface of the
hollowed area is rough, and the floor of the chamber still shows a few
shards of loose stone from the construction.

The Enclave of the Heretics~
This is a large chamber, perfectly hewn from the walls of the surrounding
caves.  A dim rumbling fills the chamber, echoing from the nearby river
control area.  The room has several sections, each given ample space by the
chamber\@s large volume.  A raised podium is in the northeast corner of the
room, ringed by stone benches.  Near the center of the room is a large,
circular table, of the sort commonly used for discussions.  Finally, there
is a small magical laboratory in the southeast of the chamber, complete with
magical grimoires and arcane symbols drawn into the ground.

The Yithoul Jeweler\@s Workshop~
The side walls of this chamber have been cut perfectly square; the back
has been hidden by a carved, folding screen, the panels made of intricately
painted, stretched silk.  Abstractly-painted wall hangings drape the sides,
and the front wall is thin rock tiled with small bone squares.  Thick,
imported rugs cover the floor, and cushions are strewn about, making
comfortable places to sit.  A low table, not even a foot off the ground
serves as a counter, and several sealed cases nearby serve to display the
jeweler\@s wares.

screen panel panels~
This screen blocks the view of the back of the workshop, presumably where
the bulk of the tools are kept and work is done.  The silk panels have been
painted in a regular, geometric pattern with faintly luminescent paints, in
a traditional style favoured by the Yithoul shuddeni.  
~
E
wall walls hanging hangings~
These wall hangings have been painted in an intricate, abstract pattern,
all curves and bizarre angles, in brilliant, often clashing colours. 
Distinct, spicy aromas drift away from the hangings, each streak of colour
giving off a different scent.  
~
E
tile tiles bone squares~
Each bone square tiling the front wall of this shop is carved in exactly
the same pattern, though each tile has a different colour, ranging from
bleached white to an aged yellow.

A table sits in the center of this dark room, piled with all manner of
parchments.  Wooden shelves line the rough stone walls, holding jars
containing various arcane materials, as well as the occasional organ or

in a jaggedly swirling, almost hypnotic, pattern.  A tiny grate no more than
a foot high is set low on the northern wall, and a similar tiny grate is

A Black Stone Bier~
The black stone of the chamber opens up significantly once atop the bier.
The platform underfoot is marked with graven images and fell runes, scribed
in such a manner as to focus energy at the bier\@s approximate center.  The
design thrums with unholy power, and its surface is slick with dimly
luminescent blood.  What little remains of previous victims is scattered
about the dull surface, although even those telltale signs dissolve quickly
into blackness.  The ceiling is fairly low and jagged, shards jutting
downward as great fangs. What little escape is possible is afforded to the
south, the shadowy passages only high enough to facilitate crawling.
