the shade of Aelisa Syire~
The shade of an onyx-winged aelin floats in shadow.
~
Before you is a shade of a woman, an aelin of somewhat greater height
than the rest of her race.  She floats here, onyx wings unmoving, as if
supported by strands of pure wind.  Adorned in black and silver, and clad in
a robe so opaque it seems to absorb the light about it, she appears more a
wraith than a woman.  From her hands, her skin is seen to be a smooth
alabaster, perfectly unblemished.  Her face is hooded, fallen into shadows
so deep that only a glimpse of the shape is visible within.  A few stray
strands of black hair fall from her hood, and deep within a pair of
glittering emerald irises can be seen.

Savae Alevrin uncanny silver-eyed human androgynous woman man~
a silver-eyed human~
A reed-slender human with uncanny silver eyes stands here.
~
Pale brown hair falls daggedly over this human\@s ears with a strange
precision for such an unkempt style.  Yet more hair collects in a puddle on
their slim shoulders, falling haphazardly beneath a scholar\@s robe. 
Crystalline earrings hang from their ears, chiming faintly against each
other any time their head moves too much.  The robes render their slender
frame androgynous, though something of their manner renders the question
irrelevant.  Even when they speak, their mellifluous voice somehow melds in
the tone of both male and female.  Their eyes stand out brilliantly, a shade
of silver never seen in nature.

Lilisa archmage nexus shunnedvaultguard shunnedvaultguard1~
Lilisa~
Lilisa, the Archmage of the Nexus, stands silently by the brazier.
~
Archmage of the Nexus and Priestess of the Secret Flame, Lilisa stands 
tall and regal by the golden brazier. Hair the colour of fire-bathed flame 
falls in long curls about her shoulders, spilling over a gown of midnight 
blue. Her face is pale and youthful, though the eyes which gaze, 
expressionless, over the long hall seem to hold the tale of long years 
beyond the count of her seeming youth. In one hand Lilisa holds a small 
ceremonial dagger, and the other rests by her side, fingers splayed as if 
ready for a casting of magic.

Sydonus High Defender shunnedvaultguard shunnedvaultguard2~
Sydonus~
Sydonus, High Defender of the Black Vanguard, stands at the rear of the dais.
~
Clad in ornate black armour and standing some seven feet tall, Sydonus
the Damned holds his eternal station at the rear of the dais.  Once an
mortal assassin of great renown, Sydonus\@s unwitting sacrifice in the
formation of the Coven has left him more demon than man.  Great bat-like
wings stretch from his back, and razor-sharp iron claws protrude from his
thickly-veined hands.  His rugged features have a somewhat savage cast -
though his firm, square chin and high cheekbones speak of a certain
nobility.  His dark eyes now gleam with a dull redness, and single scar cuts
across the left.

Meboahyar demon librarian spider~
Meboahyar the Librarian~
A monstrous black spider with a near-human face clings to the webs above.
~
A bulbous black spider, the size of a cow, clings to the shadowy webs
which fill the high dome of this chamber.  The demon\@s abdomen is hairless
and mishapen, its shiny black skin scattered with livid blotches.  Its hairy
black legs are long and arched, and the four front legs end in sharp,
blade-like claws.  Beneath each of these claws project small, finger-like
protrudences.  The creature has not the face of a spider, but that of a
human, albeit a deformed, evil one.  The face is a fiery red, and twisted as
in perpetual rage.  Mandibles projecting from the rear of its jaw twitch
erratically.  Clusters of glistening purple eyes sit atop its forehead,
above its squinting human eyes, which, oddly, are bespectacled.

ethron slave girl shunnedslavegirl~
the ethron slave girl~
A green skinned ethron girl, dressed in white silks, tends the bath.
~
This young ethron woman diligently attends to the bath chamber, plying
her strong, nimble fingers in concert with a variety of oils and salves to
ease the weariness of even the tiredest warlock.  The girl has a stature
typical of her people - standing some five feet tall, comely and softly
muscled.  She is clad in white silks, which rest loosely about her waist and
upper torso.  Elsewhere her skin shows, smooth and pale forest-green.  Her
hair is also green, but of a darker, richer shade, and falls in waves to the
nape of her slender neck.  A cheerful smile graces her pretty oval face,
although her large emerald eyes seem distant.

A hugely built man stands near the center of this chamber barking drill
orders at the men and women who train around him.  Occasionally he will call
a trainee forward and instruct them personally, usually with a few punishing
blows of his tall, iron staff.  Clad from neck to toe in heavy, black plate
armour, only the man\@s head is left exposed.  With a noble, beak-like,
albeit multiply-broken nose, dark, intelligent eyes and tussled, sandy hair,
the man is quite handsome in a particularly bear-like fashion.

the slender youth~
A slender, fair-haired youth stands waiting in the corner.
~
A lithe youth is here, clad in nothing but a pair of thin white silk
breeches.  His face is clear and innocently sensual, his beautiful dark blue
eyes a striking contrast against his curly blonde hair.  Muscular but
slender, he is slightly tanned and well-built, his fingers inconguously
delicate looking.

an alatharya weaponsmith~
A white-haired alatharya works here, his leg chained to the forge.
~
An old alatharya leans over his forge, his back bent by his endless
labour.  The smith\@s torso is a bulging mass of knotted muscle, covered only
by the scars which criss-cross his stooped back.  The scars look old, as
though this slave had learned long ago the harsh, final lesson of his
master\@s lash.  Framed by snowy hair and a long beard, the smith\@s face is
heavy with lines of toil and of age.  Faded blue eyes peer from beneath
bushy white brows.

A gaunt shuddeni clad in silken robes moves about the chamber, tinkering
with apparatus and sorting through materials.  The flowing robes do little
to hide the skeletal thinness of the creature\@s limbs, and his mottled grey
head is but a skin-sheathed skull atop a long, thin neck.  The skin where
the alchemist\@s eyes would be is yellow-stained, as are his nimble, clawing
hands.

a black-cowled initiate~
A black-cowled initiate stands in the shadows.
~
A figure stands near the shadowy corner, cowled and robed in lightless,
black cloth.  No part of the individual is visible beyond the heavy folds of
their robes - their hands remain folded in front, hidden by voluminous sleeves,
and its face is invisible in the shadows of the low-pulled cowl.  Flickering
firelight occasionally catches the faint runes embroidered around the base
and sleeves of the robes, their harsh lines briefly shimmering red before
fading again.

a black-armoured sentry~
A tall sentry in black plate armour stands motionless by the wall.
~
Standing in perfect, motionless attention, this sentry could easily be
nothing more than a statue, with every stone inch covered in black plate
armour.  Even the sentry\@s eyes are hidden, the narrow slit between
face-plate and helm holding only shadows.  In the guard\@s right hand is a
tall, iron glaive.  The base of its black metal pole rests on the ground,
and its wickedly curved, knife-like blade is a full foot above the sentry\@s
head.

A nightmare of claw, horn and chitin looms in the northern alcove.
~
A huge specimen of the ancient khil\@ayum has been bound with a circle of
power into the northern alcove of this chamber.  The beast, some twenty feet
tall, is covered in dark, glistening, horribly spiked chitin plates.  Its
long limbs end in great, sabre-like claws, each a few feet in length.  These
claws click in continuous agitation against the tiled floor, and the
creature\@s huge, toothy jaw opens and closes with slow regularity, spilling
a thin, viscous stream of fluid onto the ground.

This great leech-like creature stands erect in the southern alcove, a

tail of the demon is formed of a ring of thick, stubby tendrils, which splay
outward, planting it firmly to the tiles of the circle of power which binds
it.  A similar set of tendrils surround the leech\@s red maw, which twists to
face downward, revealing an inward-turning ring of razor-sharp teeth.  The
whole of the demon\@s sinuous body sways back and forth, and twists upon
itself, with a sickening rhythmic cadence.

the gaunt physician~
A gaunt and somber man moves quietly about the chamber, tending his charges.
~
Once physician to the Patrician of Earendam and Archmage of the Tower of
Salyra, Nyceanus Laodon dwells now in this deep chamber, gaunt and somber. 
Enslavement does not rest well on the scholar, with his glazed eyes and
sallow cheeks, and thin black hair clinging slick to his forehead.  However
he goes about his work with efficient precision, dextrous hands wielding his
scalpel with skill.  Curing as he harms, Nyceanus has become a master of the
arts of pain, and can reputedly bear open the deepest secrets of any
creature alive, so long as it is capable of feeling agony.

an aelin servant~
A young aelin man, his wings amputated, attends the table.
~
An aelin man moves gracefully about the huge feasting table, an almost
phantom presence ensuring that food and drink are plentiful.  This handsome
youth has black hair, combed neatly back from his finely boned face.  He is
dressed in a finely tailored tunic and breeches, and from his tunic the
stubs of his severed wings protrude - short, brown-feathered stalks, long
since healed.

caladaran sage caladaranvictim~
the caladaran sage~
An old caladaran is bound to a rack.
~
This old caladaran lies bound to a rack near the center of the chamber. 
His grotesquely thin frame is twisted, stretched and broken, and his hands
and feet hang limp and swollen from shattered joints encased in iron.  The
length of the creature\@s body is covered in odd, open wounds.  The wounds
appear to be old and healed, covered with thin layers of pale skin.  Yet
each laceration forms a deep cavity in the caladaran\@s flesh, as though the
wound had been held open as it tried to heal.  Deep blue eyes stare blankly
at the ceiling from a ravaged face.

the young thief~
An emaciated woman hangs limply, manacled to the wall.
~
Clad in rags, with long, matted hair covering most of her young face,
this half-starved woman hangs limply from the manacles above her head.  The
woman moves occasionally, trying to support her now-frail frame with her
buckled legs, but convulses with each movement, as though it causes her
great pain.  A hole has been torn in the side of her tattered jerkin, and a
small, red scar is visible on her pale skin.

idcizon huge dog-like dog creature demon~
the enormous fanged idcizon~
A huge, dog-like creature with a slathering, toothy mouth squats by the door.
~
This monsterous specimen of an idcizon is fully the size of a lion.  Its
massive, muscular jaws hang open, revealing ichor-coated gums which bristle
with serrated fangs.  Greenish fluid drips from its mouth and its long,
lolling tongue.  The eyes of the beast are beady and black, and peer out
vacantly in opposite directions from either side of its oversized head.  Its
dead stare is reminiscent of the mindless, hungry gaze of a shark. 
Squatting dog-like on muscular hind legs, the idcizon shifts its ruddy,
hairless body restlessly, its protruding ribcage heaving as it pants in the
stale, cold air.

Atisskalh srryn void scholar mob_12239~
Atisskalh~
Atisskalh the srryn paces here, scaled head bowed in thought.
~
The lithesome form of an ageless saurian is here, his features a
serpentine, skeletal mask.  A myriad of tear-shaped, nacreous scales overlap
the corded muscles of his frame in a tight-fitting hauberk, each reflecting
milk-white hues, like moonlight glistening across murky waters.  A pair of
bony protrusions rest atop his scalp, horn-like, while a smaller ridges
disappear into the folds of his cloak, along his spine.  His arms are
adorned with twisting, fell tattoos, tapering to hideously scarred hands,
each tipped with curving claws.  A reptilian snout flares to wide nostrils,
set above a broad maw lined with small, pointed teeth, yet his countenance
is dominated by deep-set eyes -- almond-shaped pools of molten bronze,
unblinking and intense.  Around his neck, a hemp cord adorned with fetishes
serves as a makeshift clasp for the heavy, hooded cloak that hangs over his
shoulders, the fabric appearing to absorb light with every movement or
gesture.

Aliyena~
An aelin girl of about ten with bright green eyes flutters here.
~
This young girl looks about ten, small and reedy.  Her hair is short, jet
black, and curled, framing a delicate and childish face.  Her eyes are a
deep and vivid green, offsetting her uncomfortably pouty young lips.  A pair
of white wings is folded behind her, the tips of her feathers marked with
charcoal.

a middle-aged aelin man~
A middle-aged aelin man is here, aloft on blonde wings.
~
A tall, well-built aelin, this man appears to be of middling age.  His
hair is a little lengthy without being long, covering the tops of his
pointed ears.  His face is pleasant but firm, his brow creased from
decisions and years.  He has small, brown eyes, their shade a rich,
chocolate, and otherwise unremarkable features.  Although he probably once
was remarkably strong, age has fatigued his powerful frame into something
more common.  A pair of pale blonde wings rest behind him, the brightness of
his plumage dulled with time.

cloak pale billowing strips skin strip obj_12352~
This long cloak is made from exactingly-flayed strips and pieces of skin,
somehow preserved and kept alive.  The material is warm and soft to the
touch, obscenely pleasurable to feel.  The cloak\@s patchworked component
pieces have been sewn together with threads of metal, the differing hues and
textures artfully laid out in subtle, interleaving designs.  Transparent
patches of golden ch\@taren skin are bound beside verdant green ethron flesh,
soft pink and tough silver all bound in an unholy harmony of colors and
malevolent patterning.  A clasp of braided ch\@taren sinew, beaten to silken
softness, affixes to two elaborate brooches at either shoulder.  
~
E
brooch brooches shoulder shoulders~
There are two brooches, one on the left, and one on the right.  
~
E
left~
This brooch, wrought from purest silver, is rimmed in a ring of braided
silver wire, the fine metal threads almost too numerous to count.  The
center of the elaborate brooch hinges about a stylized Eye of Bahhaoth,
certain key elements left out intentionally.  Worked to draw the eye of the
onlooker into the pupil of the Eye, no detail has been left untended.  Tiny
figures of filigree crawl inside the rim, minute humanoids bent in
subservience to the central pupil.  Captivating and fascinating, the brooch
clearly is imbued with powerful energies.  
~
E
right~
This brooch is forged from plain iron, smooth and dark, and inset with
dozens of delicate petals of razor-sharp, paper-thin onyx.  Each
seemingly-fragile petal is streaked along the inside of its concave face
with a welling stripe of velvety red hue, sanguine and rich.  The petals
cluster about a central nexus, bent inwards towards the middle.  Each bears
a tiny lesser rune of the Void on the back, picked out in glittering enamel.
As the floweret spreads wider, the petals slowly tilt, baring their
red-tinged faces to the onlooker.  A sense of protectiveness is conveyed
through the positioning of each small piece of stone, as though something
greater and more secretive were concealed at the center of the close-bunched
petals.  

The iron base of the brooch is preternaturally chill to the touch.

The Dais~
A low dais of reflective black stone extends from the center of the
western wall of this great hall.  Looming above, arches of stone rise to
support a massive dome of translucent tiles, through which shines a strange,
thin light.  Carvings in pale stone adorn the arches, architraves and dome
with images both splendid and grotesque, and on the western wall a
bas-relief of alabaster and jade depicts a scene of carnal and esoteric
magnificence.  In the center of the dais stands a great brazier, cast of
gold and set upon an obsidian pedestal.  A wispy darkness swirls like fire
within this bowl, in whose depths the blackness is absolute.

A Nexus in the Void~
Shadowy planes of power seem to converge from the surrounding blackness
to this point, where they intersect, twisting upon themselves and giving
rise to mounting waves of greater blackness which ripple back into the
waiting void beyond.  Here, amidst the angled sheets and twisting streams of
negative flow, a region of dim light exists - little more than an unhappy
luminescence arising from the intermingling of energies - but enough to
grant the mortal eye vision of the Nexus-Vault of the Coven of the Shunned.

The Hall of the Shunned~
The northwestern corner of this vast hall is dominated by a great bronze
brazier, which burns with a fierce, red blaze.  The waves of red light shine
outward, reflecting off the nearest of the two rows of high pillars which
march eastward down the hall, and bringing into sharp relief the huge arches
which support the high, many-vaulted ceiling.  Ornate carvings glint from
the cornices and architraves, indistinct in the heady light.  A row of
smaller braziers line the northern wall, extending to another large brazier
in the far northeastern corner.  The ancient, quartz-streaked stone of the
pillars and walls is offset by the richly coloured banners and hangings
which adorn the higher reaches of the walls and drape between the pillars. 
To the south rises a dais, built of black stone and set with a great golden
brazier, which seems to burn not with fire but with wisps of darkness.

The Hall of the Shunned~
From the archway in the far eastern wall a corridor of high granite
pillars march down the length of this great hall, supporting the series of
lofty vaults which rise, ever greater, to the magnificent dome above the
dais to the west.  Beyond the two rows of pillars, to the north and south,
the high walls of the hall rise, lit by brightly burning braziers. 
Offsetting the ancient, quartz-streaked stone, hangings of fine fabric and
deep, rich colours, emblazoned with a multitude of arcane symbols, drape
between the pillars and hang high on the chamber walls.  Here in the center
of the hall is set a circle of five high-backed stone chairs, each
emblazoned with a different symbol.

A Torch-Lit Passageway~
A somber, arched passageway leads away to the west, and ends in a
curtained alcove to the east.  Another opening to the south leads to a long
staircase, descending into darkness.  Pillars of grey, quartz-streaked
granite are set into the walls and hold aloft an arched ceiling, rimmed with
ancient architraves.  Each pillar bears an iron sconce, in which torches

The Library~
Row upon row of high bookshelves fill this lofty chamber, each rising a
dozen feet in the air.  From the top of each shelf a column of dark web
continues upward, opening outward to merge with the great mass of spider web
which fills the entire shadowy dome of the chamber.  Tendrils and veils of
web hang down from the mass, and certain parts of the library are completely
inaccessible due to thick layers draped between shelves.  

The books themselves seem to be uncatalogued, and only tenuously arranged 
into subject matter.  A number of glass-faced cabinets are stuffed with 
scrolls, and there are even several shelves holding stone tablets, etched 
with scripts long forgotten by all but the most recondite scholars.  Ancient 
desks of dusty, dark wood stand in the corners.  A single archway leads from 
this chamber to the south.

The Outer Antechamber~
The eastern passageway opens into this high antechamber before leading
westward into a much larger hall.  The antechamber constists of a square
area capped by a domed ceiling, and two large, semicircular alcoves in the
north and south walls.  The floor of the chamber is an intricate mosaic of
tiny tiles, which swirl and weave in complex, symmetric patterns.  Toward
the alcoves the pattern forms runic circles, encompassing pentagrams of
black tiles.

A High-Domed Chamber~
A high-domed chamber rises above you in the gloom.  Lit by two huge
braziers at the base of the wide stairway, the rough stone walls of the
chamber seem to glow with a dull, heavy red, and the high dome of the
ceiling is bathed in dancing shadows.  The pillars of pale stone support the
dome, and are capped with intricately decorated entablatures, too distant to
be discerned in the fitful light.  An archway leads through the western
wall, while a great stairway of marble rises from the center of the room and
through and archway high in the eastern wall.

shadowy upper reaches and form a flickering gateway about the base of the
stairs, which rise from between the two braziers up into the eastern wall.

The Entrance Hallway~
A passageway leads to the east and west beneath a high, arched ceiling. 
The grey stone walls are lined with pedestals supporting busts, both human
and otherwise, carved in fine marble.  Each pedestal bears a small plaque of
gold.  Between the pedestals, long torches hang at an angle from the wall,
bound by iron holders, and their red flames send spires of pale smoke to
darken the ceiling.  The hallway opens to the east and west into larger
chamber.

A domed chamber of dark limestone opens here, dimly lit by the blue light
from a series of small lanterns which hang from the ceiling.  In the center
of the chamber a large, circular pool is filled with steaming water, from
which a sultry heat rises.  The chill air from the open archway to the west
sends wisps of steam swirling around the room.  About the edge of the pool
are lined several vials containing a variety of ointments, oils and elixirs.
Next to the western archway is a tall stand for hanging clothing.

Overlooking A High-Domed Chamber~
The wide stairway opens into a high-domed chamber, erupting from the dark
tunnel high up in the eastern wall.  The stairway descends steeply to the
center of the chamber, where it is washed in the flickering red glow of two
burning braziers, which girdle the base of the stone stairs.  The high dome
of the chamber, dimly visible in the red light, appears to be heavily
decorated.  Where discernable, the designs are monstrous - strange beings,
assuredly demonic, traipse about the architraves and the ribs of the dome
with posturings both violent and obscene.  The stairway continues to rise
beyond the darkness of the eastern arch.

The Laboratory~
This well-equipped laboratory has been laid out in this bluestone
chamber.  Well-lit with several shining lanterns hanging from the low-domed
ceiling, a huge array of oddly shaped glassware gleams from around the
walls.  The northern wall holds a densely stacked bookshelf, with old, thick
tomes wedged amongst piles of note parchment.  A curved stone shelf sits
high in one corner.  A bench against the northern wall is equipped
everything needed for the casting of runes and the forging of enchanted
items.  Beneath this bench are stacked several small cages, each holding one
or more scrawny looking animals.  Another larger bench against the southern
wall, equipped with clamps for wrists, ankles and head, is clearly intended
for larger experimental subjects.  A stone archway leads through the western
wall.

glassware~
A huge array of glassware lines the walls and benches, from pungent vials
sizzling over low flames to complicated tracks of tubing, slowly distilling
acrid liquids.  High shelves on the walls hold rows of jars, each containing
one body part or another, both internal and external, human and beastial.  
~
E
bookshelf~
The wide bookshelf, build from a heavy, ash-coloured wood, is crammed
with books and reams of parchment.  Most titles refer to obscure aspects of
the alchemist\@s art.  Entire treatise on distillation processes fill half of
one shelf, and several compendia detail the uses of the body parts of
creatures, exotic and otherwise.  The piles of loose parchment are mostly
covered in a small, spidery scrawl - clearly the notes of some researcher in
the field.

The Chamber of the Pentagram~
Deep beneath the foundations of the halls above, this chamber is hewn
from the very rock of the hills\@ roots.  Bluestone buttresses hold the
cavern\@s roof aloft, forming four huge arches which intersect in an
eight-pointed star above you.  Small stalactites hang from the bluestone,
and the occasional drip of water echoes through the cavern.  In the very
center of this space, a large pentagram has been carved into the stone
floor, its center superimposed with a great trigon.  The symbol is scored
throughout with graven runes, each harsh upon the eye, and abstruse symbols
of unclear, yet certainly unwholesome function.  An iron door, also scored
with runes, is set into the eastern wall.

tiered crescents, forming arena-style seating.  The wide floorspace of the
arena itself is being used as a training ground for several warriors.  The
stone tiers are broken by archways in the north, south and west walls.

The Feasting Hall~
A long hall stretches southward beneath a series of high, supporting
arches.  Upon the bluestone walls, between the rising arches, hang a series
of large paintings.  Each painting is a portrait of exquisite detail, set in
a frame of gold.  A table of rich, red mahogany extends much of the length
of the hall, and is set with dozens of plushly upholstered chairs.  The
table is laden with foods both sumptuous and exotic, set upon silver
platters, and scattered amongst these are many crystal decanters and wine
bottles.  A large set of double oak doors lead through the north wall.

The Forge~
This large stone chamber is both forge and armoury, with racks of
completed swords, glaives and maces lining the walls, and armour of
blackened iron stacked in the corners.  Two great forges stand against the
north and south walls, with the floor inbetween filled with anvils,
workbenches and piles of half-finished pieces.  Heat flows from the forges
in throbbing waves, accompanied by the ceaseless beating of the smiths\@
hammers.  An archway leads eastward from this room into a a wide chamber.

The Torture Chamber~
This cavernous room seems to form part of the foundations of the halls
above.  Set in the hollows of two massive supporting arches, this space has
been converted into a workshop for the extraction of pain.  Several long
benches are scattered about the expansive floor, equipped with manacles and
clamps, and a winch at each end.  Manacles also hang from the bluestone
arches, and one set hangs through a pully from the roof, above a similar set
of ankle-irons.  A table stands near the center of the room, neatly arrayed
with a surprisingly delicate collection of implements.  A small, dark
archway in the west wall is set with a heavy oaken door.  To one side of
this door a small, black recess gapes.  A winding stairway begins its upward
climb to the north. In the floor a locked iron grate leads to a dungeon cell.

A Cold Dungeon Cell~
Only a faint, red light illuminates this deep cell from the grill set
into the ceiling high above.  The limestone walls seem to ooze moisture, and
in many places the floor is covered with puddles of freezing water.  A few
mounds of mouldering straw strewn near the walls provide scant relief from
the cold, hard floor.  Manacles hang from three of the four walls, and in a
few of these the decomposing remains of forgotten prisoners slowly crumble
away.

The Tabernacle of a Thousand Demons~
Shadows dance madly upon the rough, silver-veined marble of the walls
which close about you, their form and motion defined by the flickering light
of a dizzying array of candles.  The luminaries, while ranging from slender,
tapered bodies near the fore, to the thick, imposing monuments of wax nearer
the eastern wall, are uniformly dark in tone.  Arranged in concentric
circles and each bearing an apparently unique sigil, they range from a deep
crimson in the outer strata to a black of most uncanny depth within.  At the
center of the room, a deeply-stained block of oak pierces upward through the
candles\@ shroud, its surface overlaid with bronze.  Above it, a tarnished
silver censer swings from a weighty steel chain, acrid smoke trickling from
its pores to flow across the unsympathetic glyph scored into the altar\@s
surface, and into a silver bowl of blood in front.  

To the west a velvet curtain hangs, offering concealment from the hall
outside.

pentagram, its sides thick and bold.  The interior is filled, but broken by
a large and small rune.  Near the center is the smaller rune, which is one
of the ancient signs of the Void.  Around and atop this rune is the larger,
which is dedicated to the Dragon.  

The symbol seems to throb with an unworldly power.  Perhaps a deeper insight
could be gleaned by studying it.

Staring down at the brazen altar, your full focus is quickly captured by
the glaring sigil on its surface.  Manifestly a Symbol of Power, this
rendering of the Sigil of of Logor courses with eldritch energies.  You find
yourself stooped over the altar, your whitening knuckles clenched to its
edges.  As the acrid smoke of the censer seizes your lungs, you find
yourself blacking out.  

And everything is darkness.  

It seems as though you float in the darkness, surrounded by a deathly,
stagnant chill which gnaws at your flesh.  You quickly realise that the void
is not complete.  Great filaments of material stretch across the bleak
distance, jagged detritus bound to vast tendrils of flowing energy.  The
filaments converge on a single point of focus - a redly-pulsing glow some
great distance below you, inasmuch as such directions have meaning here.  

Before you, the red glow begins to take form, as though the vast distances
separating you from it had evaporated in an instant.  You hang, immobile,
far above an immense city - or so you assume it to be, although it resembles
no other city in existence.  It is formed entirely of monumental spires of
volcanic glass, which bristle upward in their thousands from a vast mass of
viscous magma and burning black slag.  The lower parts of the great spires
are, particularly towards the rim of the city, heated to a molten glow,
while their upper reaches vary in texture from twisting bundles of glassy
fibre to thick, reflective slabs of rock.  

Each and every tower in the city seems to be riddled with tunnels, as well
as forming the foundation for hundreds of iron structures.  These
ubiquitous, ugly extentions cling squatly against the glassy surfaces or
rise like sharp, metallic fangs into the void above.  Rust-coloured iron
bridges connect adjacent spires, or in some places leap high above the
surface of the city in precarious highways.  And across these highways, and
in the vapid air between the spires, and, indeed, everywhere you look, roam
the miriad denizens of the city, the thousand breeds of demonkind who are
the citizens of the void city Logor.  

The entire city seems to be in a state of violent, dynamic flux.  As you
watch, a spire near the rim quakes and then topples, shattering several of
its neighbours as it collapses into the magma.  Iron bridges twist and snap,
hurling hundreds, perhaps thousands of demons into the ruin.  Fragments
topple from the rim, joining the ragged streamers which stretch off into the
void.  You see now that the lava spilling downward from the ruin joins a
long stream of many tendrils which trails off from the base of the city.  It
is with some disconcertion that you realise that the bulk of these tendrils
are not formed by similar spillages of lava, but are of a fleshy, organic
nature, bearing a resemblance to the poisonous filaments of some monstrous
jellyfish, or to the ravaged, trailing guts of a disemboweled beast.  

You now view the city from below, where a great, pulpy, bleeding mass forms
its base.  As you watch the gruesome, cosmic horror thresh its way through
the void, one of the thinner tendrils whips across you, binding you in its
sticky fold.  You black out once more as you are slowly sucked upward and
into the city.  

When you come to, you are still staring down at the graven altar, with the
Sigil of Logor seared forever into your nightmares.

candles~
Upon closer inspection, the sigils inscribed upon the candles appear
vaguely demonic, their lines occasionally intersecting at what would appear
to be impossible angles.  Even more curiously, while rivulets of hardened
wax have formed upon their surfaces, none of the candles seem to be consumed
in their burning.

An Immaculate Sitting Room~
This sitting room is immaculately clean and well-furnished, from the
thick rug covering the floor to the corners of the ceiling.  Much of the
room is lined with gold, either from the edging on the paint and subtle
papering, or overt ornamentation such as lamps and a bold, central
chandelier.  Opening from the foyer to the west, the room is imposing in a
very Ilodaiyan manner.  The east wall is nearly consumed by a vast, framed
painting of the city and its famed founding disc.  The north wall has a
doorway, behind which is a stairwell heading up to the next floor, the door
frame flanked by an expensive coat of arms and another expensive painting. 
The south wall has a large picture window, overlooking the estate, the
furniture arranged such that one can peer out through the window during
visits if they so wished.  A large couch, finely upholstered and studded
with gold on the armrests, is settled in the approximate center of the room,
flanked by a large decorative plant and a small end table.  A coffee table
sits before the couch, its surface polished to a mirror shine.

E
rug carpet~
The rug is woven from the finest of wool, giving it a coarse texture but
dyed in vibrant color.  Like most else in the room, it looks as though a
foot has never touched it.  It covers much of the floor, partially
concealing an otherwise impressive example of hardwood flooring.  
~
E
chandelier~
An imposing but expertly crafted chandelier hangs from the ceiling, which
has been worked into fine shapes molded from painted plaster.  The
chandelier itself is gold and strung with crystals, tiny, glowing shards
mixed amongst the others.  The effect of the ensemble is both lighting and
allowing for refracted color at the room\@s edges.  
~
E
painting city disc~
A huge, almost wall-consuming painting, this vast canvas depicts Ilodaiya
during the War of Night period.  The black alatharyan disc that supports the
city is detailed exquisitely, shimmering paint used to trace the lines and
vectors of its alien adornment.  The city above towers high, its spires
somehow even more stylized than those of modern times.  Despite having no
soil, the city itself is depicted with a vast array of lush trees, its many
delicate structures lifting above the finely detailed foliage.  The great
imperial court of the earliest ages sits at the city\@s heart, supposedly the
seat of Serachel and Alia\@s debauched reign.  In this rendition, it shines
as a beacon, bringing illumination to all around it-- including the world at
large.  
~
E
table coffee~
A large coffee table sits before the couch, its mahogany surface polished
to a mirror shine.  Like the couch, the legs of the table, and the edges of
its surface, are lined with inset gold.  Although it has a tasteful,
flowering centerpiece, it has the look of never being used, despite being
spotless.
