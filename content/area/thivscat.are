they are large and expressive.  It sits perched on its mistress\@s shoulder,
eyes calmly contemplating its surroundings and tail wrapped like an ornament
down her arm.  When she moves it leaps up into the sky silent and
efficiently, fading from view despite is color.  Its sleek lines are
outlined a minute before it disappears from view again, reappearing by its

Passage Beginning~
This tunnel exudes an aura of sliminess.  The walls glisten with muck,
coated with the sticky, tepid stuff.  Even the floor is coated with slime. 
From here, there seem to be two ways to go: up into the city, or east,
deeper into the damp underground passage.  A breath of fresh air filters
down through the grate above you.  To the east, the passage quickly fades
into darkness.

The passage you are in is dark and slimy.  The air is hazy and thick,
mercifully blocking out much of the scenery.  From what you can see, the
walls are coated with a thick, green slime that is slowly oozing its way
towards the floor.  There are two exits, east and west.  To the west you
almost think you can see a glimmer of light.  To the east there is only
darkness, and the faint scratching of rats on the cobbles of the
passageway.

The Pit~
You hit the ground with a thud.  Looking up the twenty or so feet you
fallen into the pit.  The walls are earthen, but hard packed and brittle
with roots twisting out at crazy angles.  The air is musty and hard to
breathe.  It is large enough only for you to stand with both of your
shoulder brushing the wall.  Through the stirred up dust, you gaze up to the
trap door, which for some reason you can no longer see.

Waiting Room~
The first thing you notice when you step into this room is the perfume
fumes.  The whole place seems to be soaked in the scent of cloying lavender.
Cushions litter the floor, as well as a few low tables that aren\@t quite
clean.  A long, red couch sits a top richly woven carpets against the far
wall, with a gold brocade blanked thrown clumsily over it for effect.  A
crystal adorned lamp lights the whole place up with rainbows which sparkle
across the altogether gaudy room.  There is a polished wooden door to the
west and a red and pink beaded curtain to the east, through which high
pitched giggling can be heard.

Emmeline\@s room is sumptuously decorated.  The stone floor and walls are
covered with a plush velvet carpet and tapestries showing men and women in
strange positions doing indecent things Most the space is taken up by the
huge canopy feather bed.  Its satin covers are rumpled, pillows are strewn
all over and there seems to be various bits of clothing in it as well. 
There is a huge gilt mirror on the east wall, opposite the bed, and a silken
ropes tied to each of the bedposts.  There is a vanity overflowing with
cosmetics and several bottles of wine, brandy and various other alcohols as
well as some more potent drugs.

This closet is full to exploding with clothes.  Silks, satins, furs,

As you search farther into the closet, you are rewarded to find a trapdoor in
the ceiling.  From the breath of fresh air that filters down through it, you
assume it leads back up to the city.  Extricating yourself from a fur coat
that greets you with a swarm of moths, you look at your exits: south and up.

This dank anteroom has been hewn from the granite bedrock on which the

gleams with a dark luster.  Torches set in rusting sconces flicker faintly. 
To the north, the chamber opens up into a long room, and to the west a
narrow passage leads into the shadows.

An Examination Chamber~
This long and rather dusty room is lined along the western and eastern
walls with sturdy, wide desks that bear a variety of scholar implements.  At
the far northern end of the room a single wooden pedestal sits.  Used as a
place for the Patrician\@s aids to examine and study artifacts that may be
potentially dangerous, the room shows signs of its purpose- old scorch-marks
and partially blackened desks, and arcane charts and mystic scrolls tacked
to the walls.

Ancient Courtyard~
You have come to an ancient courtyard.  There are crumbling stone walls
that arch overhead, covered with tangled ivy that filters the sunlight into
shady greens and blues that form a canopy overhead.  It is cool and dim,
with a warm breeze ruffling the leaves that cling to the grey stone
overhead, creating shadows moving across the stone walls.  The walls are
lined with wildflowers that sparkle with pinpricks of color, and a fountain
gurgles in the middle.  There are stone benches scattered about the paved
walkways, beckoning you to sit and rest for a moment in this paradise.

A Dim Hallway~
You are in a hallway that leads to the east and west.  Both directions
are lined with doors from which echoes the sounds of giggling and the
rustling of material.  There are torches on the walls that cast flickering
shadows on the stone walls and doors that line the hall.

Whores quarters~
You have come to a sumptuously decorated room.  Plush velvet carpets
cover the floor and tapestries hang from the walls, covering the bare grey
stone.  A bed sits against the far wall, covered with embroidered pillows
and a finely made quilt.  The smell of myrrh drifts in the air, coming from
a bronze brazier in the corner.  The only thing that seems really out of
place in this room is a shelf on the western wall.

An Alcove~
You are standing in a comfortable little room, removed a little from the
sounds and havoc of the hall outside.  It is equipped with a wide couch
sprinkled liberally with pillows which looks very appealing.  A copper
brazier burns in the corner setting clouds of fragrant smoke floating across
the room with a slighly intoxicating affect.  Curtains cover the doors to
your north and west, and the sounds of laughter and talking drift through.

At the Tables~
You are surrounded by tables on every side.  All around you people are
drinking and laughing and being improper as only befits these surroundings. 
Harassed barmaids scurry around trying to supply beer quickly enough for the
patrons here.  To your north is a door and to your west the tables and
dancing continues.

Store room~
All around you are shelves of liquor.  This must be a bard\@s dream come
true.  Kegs and kegs of beer line one wall from floor to ceiling neatly
dusted and stacked.  Bottles of green, blue, red, gold and brown glint in
the light like jewels.  Bottles and bottles of wine are gathering dust along
the top shelves; apparently the patrons of this inn don\@t have very refined
tastes.  Some more potent brews are sitting in crates, waiting to be
unloaded.

At the Tables~
You are standing amidst the many tables that are in this hall.  People
lounge about, drinking and laughing and making a lot of noise.  The smells
of unwashed bodies and stale ale permeate the air.  Gambling seems one of
the chief pastimes of this establishment, and cards flutter like deranged
butterflies all around you.

and stagger about, knocking into people and apologizing loudly.  You see two
obviously intoxicated men dancing a sad imitation of the tango, blissfully
ignorant of their behavior.

There is a small, makeshift stage set up here.  Musicians play a lively

cacophony of sounds come to your ears.

There is a wooden dancefloor built into the stonework of the hall here
for the convenience of its inhabitants.  Worked across the woodwork you
notice the sigil of a talon with jagged claws, making the floor seem
sinister.  Despite this, people seem to be laughing and dancing around to
the music of harp and drum that comes from a small stage to the south.

You shouldn\@t bring Reg into this.  This has NOTHING to do with Pan....
Don\@t be afraid to log onto pan, I won\@t bother you there.
I promise you that, simply cause I want to stay there and continue as an Imm.
Do not continue to be afraid like that, and get me deleted.  Do not lie to
Reg or Pug about something I did.  If you do either of these things, I will
get revenge on you...I swear it.
You DO know what I can do to you, if you try to ruin my position there.
And there are things you don\@t know about, as well, that I can do.  I will
try not to bother you anymore, but I can\@t make promises.  When you were
so rude to me yesterday, turning off tells and all, I flipped...and I have
yet to unflip. :P

To: Gwynneth
Michelle, why do you ignore me, why do you shut me out?  I still love you
so much, and I\@m willing to forgive all you\@ve done to me.  Damnit, things
are getting worse and worse for me.  Why do you not want me anymore?  Have
you honestly found a guy to replace me?  Do you think you ever will?
Don\@t think I\@ll go away, don\@t think I\@ll ever stop trying to get you back.
If I do, I won\@t have anything to live for anymore.
As I said before, DO NOT tell Reg or Pug about this, if you get me kicked off
I\@ll simply strike back at you with full force, sacraficing everything
if that\@s what it takes.  Damnit Michelle, you know you\@re mine.  YOu
always will be!  Don\@t try to hide from me, don\@t pretend I don\@t have
feelings.  I\@m dying inside without your affection...I simply don\@t know
what to do.
Andrew
 
To: Gwynneth
You have a few choice at this point in time.
1.  You can keep asking Reg for help, getting me kicked off, and getting
in horrible trouble with your parents.  Also, bringing complete hell to your
life for it.
2.  You can try to talk to me, I wish you would, and perhaps we can get past
this ordeal.
3.  YOu can keep ignorning me, making me only try harder
and harder to get you back.  I\@ll fly to where you live if that\@s what it
takes.  Don\@t think I\@m just saying that either.
4.  You can try to get your parents or the law involved.  Which, won\@t
help you at all...only will make things worse.  But please, go ahead.  At
least I\@ll have an excuse to say \@fuck it\@ and go all out on you.
Don\@t think this is a game, don\@t think I\@m just throwing threats at you.
This is real, my emotions are very real, and I\@m very desperate.  Don\@t
drive me too far, or you\@ll regret it for the rest of your life.
To: Gwynneth
Well, Michelle, you went and did something stupid.  You made your choice.
And now it\@s time to pay for what you have done.
BTW, this is not a death threat. :P
 
To: Gwynneth
You don\@t know how angry you\@ve made me.  You spoiled
little bitch.  Is it going to be fun when both your mother
and father know what I did to you?  I bet it will be...
Hrm, dunno how long I\@ll wait though, before I tell them.  I\@ll let
you sweat it out a bit, first...make it fun for me.

Those who have chosen the paths of Chaos and Darkness may choose to serve
the goddess, Lilune.  Shrouded in mystery and shadow, she is the goddess of
impurity and corruption.  She seeks nothing more than to torment those who
have chosen the light and the law, and to gain the pleasure of their torment
once they have broken from their path.  Petty and selfish, she would see the
utter ruination of all that she has not created.  Those that serve her
should be subject only to the whim of flesh and mind, serving that whim with
a ruthless cruelty.  Their actions may be something so bold as to physically
kill others, or as small as starting a rumor to poison their hearts.  Acts
of d eceit that pain others regardless of who they are.  They must harbor a
special hate for lightwalkers.
