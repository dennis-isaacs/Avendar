the khil\@ayum~
A hulking figure covered with sharp spikes, the khil\@ayum glares hatefully.
~
The khil\@ayum are a brutish race that once dwelt in the catacombs of the
Darken Reaches. They preyed upon humans and other sentient races, and it
is said that the terror they inflicted through their ravages fed them as
much as the flesh that they rent from innocent bones. Once entrenched in
an area, the khil\@ayum are nearly impossible to exterminate, as their evasive
capabilities are formidable. Several centuries ago they spread across many
lands, and the Titans finally intervened. Now the remainder of their kind
is locked in the Astral Prison.

xthjich demon~
Xthjich~
Xthjich, the Eternal Demon, flexes his leathery wings and razor claws.
~
Xthjich is a 12\@ tall figure with leathery black skin and huge bat-like
wings. Cruel fangs curve down from his slavering mouth, and razor-sharp
claws tip his long, bony fingers. Known as the Eternal Demon, Xthjich has
menaced the Light throughout time. Once confined for 300 years by a mage
of Istilail, he escaped by catching his jailor off guard and devouring him.
Xthjich then gathered an army of the vilest powers and lead his forces to
the destruction of the Iilim, a peaceful and gentle race. He met with the
forces of light at Anda, where he was struck down by the Titan Captain
Oradan, and sealed in this prison.

An immense black worm plated with thick scales, Haj-Ra writhes about.
~
Haj-Ra is an enormous, black-plated C\@thsa worm. His 20\@ body is encased in
a thick layer of chitin, and no sensory organs are visible. Hailing from
the black world of Yra, Haj-Ra bred his loathsome spawn, the C\@thsa worms,
and set out to devour the many worlds of the universe. He was only stopped
when the Titans intervened, stripped him of much of his power, and confined
him in this cell. Here he has rested for over 8,000 years.

~
A 30\@ mass of writhing tentacles, flailing eyestalks, and noxious slime,
the odious Sothmogga hisses and burbles in his cell. One of the creations
of the Archmage Vila, who wielded the Nyakigah Sha Yith for several
centuries, Sothmogga grew immensely in power when he defiled the Grove of the
Celanim and drained the power of their trees. So strong had he become that
he sought to open a permanent portal between the ruined Grove and this,
our own world. Left momentarily vulnerable, Sothmogga was impaled by the
templar Converu, and thus his ravages were halted.

Great Ones has been rare in the last hundred years.
Nevertheless, the White Castle is ever a gathering place for those of the

seeking the council of the wisest being to dwell in physical form upon this

to represent his kind in an upcoming Council. The Bears of Goran are a
reclusive race, often said to have never existed. But many a goodly traveller
has become lost in the Woods of Goran only to return with tales of large \@
intelligent bears coming to their aid.

Alerra of the River, so called for her devotion to the sphere of Water,
is commonly reported to be the most powerful healer to ever live in Ardron.

for the greater benefit of all.

Barlonde the Jester began his career as the court entertainer for the

Barlonde learned of that he did not partake of in some form.  His most
daring feat was to sneak into the keep of the vile sorcerer Ankhemes and
steal the Amulet of Seton, returning it to the temple from whence it came.

Gyel-Xan~
Gyel-Xan, leader of the Spawn of Sothmogga, stands here.
~
Gyel-Xan is the leader of the cult of Sothmogga, and foremost among its
Spawn.  Originally one an unborn of the celestial race of the Celanim,
Gyel-Xan, like his fellow spawn, was twisted and corrupted by the coming of
that cosmic horror.  

Gyel-Xan stands about as tall as an alatharya, but his entire body is
covered by ropy, midnight-black tentacles.  An acidic sheen covers his skin,
and only magic prevents the dissolution of his dark silk robes.  Little
trace remains of his Celanimic heritage, save his eyes, which pulse with a
deep blue energy.

powerful archmage Vila, who used the Nyakigh Sha Yith to threaten the
scattered human kingdoms following the Gandar Age.  This culminated in the
creation of Sothmogga, a cosmic horror who devestated the demiplane of the
Celanim and then Avendar proper.  Taking up the Javelin of Heavenly Flames,
Converu mortally wounded Sothmogga, but sacrificed his own life in the
process.  Converu\@s spirit was given power to cleanse the Grove of the
Celanim, and when the last of the Spawn of Sothmogga, Gyel-Xan, was
contained, he ascended to the status of demigod.  This helm was part of the
set of blessed armor Converu wore his entire life, which was bequeathed to
the templars of his line.

a shining white breastplate~
A white breastplate shines with holy light.~
This breastplate is one of the pieces of the legendary white armor of
Converu, a human templar from ages long past.  Converu battled ceaselessly
against the powerful archmage Vila, who used the Nyakigh Sha Yith to
threaten the scattered human kingdoms following the Gandar Age.  This
culminated in the creation of Sothmogga, a cosmic horror who devestated the
demiplane of the Celanim and then Avendar proper.  Taking up the Javelin of
Heavily Flames, Converu mortally wounded Sothmogga, but sacrificed his own
life in the process.  Converu\@s spirit was given power to cleanse the Grove
of the Celanim, and when the last of the Spawn of Sothmogga, Gyel-Xan, was
contained, he ascended to the status of demigod.  This breastplate was part
of the set of blessed armor Converu wore his entire life, which was
bequeathed to the templars of his line.

This sword is believed to be the personal sword of the legendary
templar-saint, Converu.  It has been handed down to his descendents with
each succeeding generation, each one tasked with both the protection of the
blade and its use in the punishment of evil.  

After the unprecedented evil of the War of Night, the war-weary Deremegon
converted to the worship of the child-goddess, Alajial.  Troubled by the
knowledge that he and his children would forever be destined to fight, he
prayed to Her for guidance.  She is said to have blessed the sword and him,
absolving him of his burden of guilt.

A silver necklace embossed with the symbol of Alajial is here.~
Alajial, the caladaran goddess of compassion, has had precious little
influence in Avendar within this age.  While a few small orders of monks and
charity workers continue her worship, she has not blessed them with her
presence often.  
This powerful holy symbol is a relic of an age when Alajial\@s attention was
directed upon the lands much more frequently. An-Nindon, the most powerful
of her followers, carries the symbol out of reverence for all it stands for.
He is known to allow others of the light to use it when their need is dire.

the ceremonial knife of the Iphesta~
A ceremonial knife, scribed with aelin figures and characters, rests here.~
This knife bears the ceremonial markings of the house of Iphesta, one of
the most ancient and venerated of the great aelin families.  The Iphesta\@s
recorded history stretches back to the time of the War of Fire, when they
were among the first aelin scholars of water.  For generations, they used
their magics to protect the great aelin cities, tirelessly working to
preserve the aelin way of life.  

As a gift from their house to the aelin people, they built architectural
marvels in every aelin city.  By far the most famous was the Iphestan Maze
of Ilodaiya, whose twisting and circuitous paths are said to be an homage to
the crafty and cunning scholars and politicians of the great house.  

During the War of Night, the Iphestans faced treachery from within, when an
offshoot of their family followed Serachel into deceit and treachery against
Ilodaiya.  Breaking with tradition, the Iphestans began to train their
youngest children as assassins rather than scholars.  Upon completion of
their training, they were given knives of this kind, consecrated to the
destruction of traitors to the light.

This staff is a powerful artifact of the magics of earth, wielded only by

is a perilous task at best, since it involves a personal pilgrimage to the
elemental plane of earth, where the scholar harvests a crystal attuned to
his very essence.  Even surviving the journey does not ensure success, for
the scholar must work uninterrupted for a single year to shape the crystal
into a usable form, with the risk of a lethal magical accident quite high.

the dark silk robes of Gyel-Xan~
A pile of dark silk lies here.~
These are the robes of Gyel-Xan, leader of the spawn of Sothmogga.  The
Spawn of Sothmogga, as they styled themselves, where actually the children
of the Celanim, corrupted by the passing of that cosmic horror.  Long did
the spawn continue the menace the Celanim, until they were nearly completely
exterminated by the celestial essence of Converu, the same templar who
banished Sothmogga.  

Gyel-Xan, mightiest and most cunning of his kind, lead a clutch of his
brethren away from his home plane when the finding of the Chalice of Jolinn
cause a dimensional disturbance which opened up a portal to the prime
material.  Long foreseen by his sinister auguries, Gyel-Xan was well
prepared for this day, arriving in Avendar armed with an arsenal of
nefarious magics.  

He used an artifact known as the Orb of Illusions to obscure the Titans from
the world at large, resulting in the widespread fear that their great kind
had departed Avendar entirely.  Distracting the forces of the light with the
release of a demon lord of some potency, he manipulated events to acquire
the last remaining page of the Nyakigh Sha Yith, along with the mystical
power needed for his plan.  

Convincing the rest of his sect that he actually meant to free Sothmogga,
Gyel-Xan began poisoning humans with Sothmogga\@s taint, and proceeded to
encircle the Titan castle, with the heedless Titans still blind to the
world.  Little did his followers realize, however, that Gyel-Xan had no
desire to free Sothmogga instead, he sought to drain Sothmogga\@s power
completely, instead becoming the cosmic horror himself!  

Fortunately, a group of Champions found the Orb of Illusions in Gyel-Xan\@s
secluded lair, and broke it on Anirim\@s throne, releasing the Titans. 
Seeing his plans unravel, Gyel-Xan drew on Sothmogga\@s power recklessly,
failing to realize that in doing so, he would be trapped in the same spell
which bound Sothmogga in the astral prison.  His sect and demon army were
defeated, and Gyel-Xan shared the same fate as his progenitor: eternity
sealed away from the world under the care of the Titans.

events of cosmic proportions.  The pillars line the open front of the
castle, forming a row heading east and west.  To the north, unseparated by
walls and marked only by the beginning of a red carpet, is the grand council
room of the Titans.

The Cell of Xthjich~
The door opens into a large, bare cell.  The walls measure approximately
20\@ on each side, with the ceiling about the same height.  Each wall is
scored by talon marks, and the white of the stones is marred by scorch marks
and deep red streaks.  The doorway, though it opens to the hall outside, is
blocked by mystical runes that glow and crackle in midair.  

The Eye of Xthjich is burned into the floor of the cell.

You reel, as you no longer see the confines of the astral cell.  



You stand on a dark plain, glaring through a yellowed eye onto the field of
a vast battle.  Ahead of you, and all around sinister and eldritch horrors
seethe and roil, part of a great host.  At their head, the monstrous demon
general Xthjich leads the abominations in a surging swarm of pure force.  

He turns, to stare at you, and you are ensnared by his gaze.  His claws tear
the air, and he roars.  You cannot look away, though, and are drawn into his
eyes.  Their dark pits consume the entire scene, and, horrifyingly, you are
lost in their exquisite emptiness.....  



The vision clears, and the Eye of Xthjich has burned itself onto the weave
of your mind.  
~

eye~
The eye of Xthjich is the canonical pentagram, but with a stylized and
glaring eye drawn in the central pentagon.  The eye is angry, and is
surrounded by lines representing radiant fire in the various branches of the
pentagram.  

This particular symbol is burnt into the floor of the near invulnerable
astral cell.  You might more learn more of it if you were to study it.

this cell by a host of mortals and the legendary Converu, Gyel-Xan\@s body
became ensnared by the same power that also binds the form of its Lord.  It
now hungers, eternally and in silence, its blighted brethren long ago struck
