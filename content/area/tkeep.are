man blank eyed blank-eyed gaunt unshaven~
a blank-eyed man~
A blank-eyed man is here, gaunt and unshaven.
~
This man is starveling-thin and quite naked, his wasted body covered with
sores of the imprisoned.  His flesh has begun to suppurate in places, the
rotting stink palpable as a blow to the face.  His pale brown hair has grown
down over his shoulders, matted and unkempt.  A scraggly beard grows in
wispy, dirty strands.  Shriveled arms and legs seem to be nothing more than
baggy skin over bare bones.  

The man\@s eyes are the most striking feature of his decrepit body, however. 
Wide and staring, they possess the blank unexpression of the blind, yet with

a doglike figure~
A horrifying doglike figure crouches here.
~
This chilling figure is foggy and indistinct about the edges, square body
vaguely reminiscent of a bulldog.  Squatting on the floor, it regards you
with two large, corpse-pale sections of tissue which might be eyes.  A
bulbous, obscene knob of flesh serves as a head, and the indistinct legs
seem smoky and noncorporeal.  The figure sits with awful patience, at once
tensed to spring and yet confidently relaxed.

an emaciated ethron~
An emaciated ethron shivers here, a mass of inflamed scars where his eyes should be.
~
This ethron is starveling-thin and quite naked, his wasted body covered
with sores of the imprisoned.  His flesh has begun to suppurate in places,
the rotting stink palpable as a blow to the face.  Shriveled arms and legs
seem to be nothing more than baggy skin over bare bones.  A shaved head
shows several ugly bruises.  The ethron\@s eyes are gone, angry flushed scar
tissue healing poorly.  Apparently the result of crude cauterizing, the
horrific scarring has served only to stop any bleeding, rather than to
sterilize.  The man seems entirely dumb to the fact that he is so badly
injured or even alive, utterly mindless.

This skeleton is composed of thick, shiny yellow bone, the frame
apparently taken from a powerful animal.  Six arms sprout from three pairs
of shoulders on the broad torso, each pair oriented in a different
direction.  Cruel, slashing claws tip the powerful limbs, wicked and
scythelike.  A long, canine head sits on the vertebrae of the neck, eye
holes curved in a mocking, glaring gaze.  Vicious teeth arc from the
jawbone, a few shreds of tendon yet holding the mandible in place.  The
demon moves with a fitful, twitchy energy, eager and impatient.

A curvaceous, naked succubus hovers here on diaphanous wings.

A combination of features both horrific and beautiful, this initiate of
Pricina hovers before you on spined, batlike wings.  The succubus hovers
unclothed, her soft curves readily visible.  Visible too are her unnaturally
long fingers and toes, the digits elongating into piercing claws.  The flesh
of her hands and feet are black as pitch, a stark contrast to the skin of
milky white covering the rest of her body.  Where white flesh meets black,
the colors spatter into one another as they blend.  The skin of her face is
pulled tight over her skull, the gaunt appearance contrasting the pleasant
softness the rest of her body seems to have.  Her eyes also strike you as
unnatural, the pupils vertical slits, like a cat\@s.  The eyes flash hungrily
as they dart, searching.

a sore-covered youth~
A slender youth, his skin covered in leprous sores, smiles at you beatifically.
~
This slender youth appears to have once been possessing of strength and
grace.  The disease which clearly has ravaged his body seems to have taken
most of that away.  Sores cover his skin, several of which ooze a
white-yellow pus.  His skin has taken on a pallid, greenish hue and is
covered in pock marks.  His fingertips are worn to the very bone and caked
with his own blackened blood.  Deep gouges rend his flesh, seemingly
self-inflicted.  The most unsettling thing amidst this fleshly tapestry of
horror is his face.  A rapturous grin splits his face, his blood-red eyes
glittering with joy.

The churning cloud before you is composed of fine grey dust.  A curious

A large, headless spider with chitin of glittering gold stalks here.
~
A large metallic spider stands here on long, segmented legs.  Its
exoskeleton seems made from glittering, textured gold which reflects the
light in sparkling spots.  The thorax is small and slender, eight legs
supporting the weight of the beast on their slender length.  The abdomen is
grossly swollen, and might be considered sagging were it not rigid and
metallic.  No head adorns the body, a blank metal plate taking the place of
its neck.  Despite any lack of sensory organs or mouth, the spider seems
more than aware of the area, and its posture suggests a predatorial,
avaricious frame of mind.

You are in a tall hallway which stretches into darkness to the east and

touch, which seems to actively absorb light.  The paint is peeling off the
walls in rough strips and flakes, revealing the planed grey stone beneath. 
No window, carving, or tapestry breaks the blank perfection of the walls. 
High above, a curving, vaulted ceiling is vaguely visible in the oppressive
gloom.  The basalt floor is obscured in a heavy blanket of muffling dust,
for the most part undisturbed.  Cool and still, the heavy air seems to
dampen your senses.  To the south, a tall stone door stands, firmly shut.

material materials~
This section is drawn in great detail - several types of twigs are shown,
each labeled with a commonly recognizeable leaf beneath it.  No words are
used on the diagrams.  The {yholly{n branches are covered with grey bark
with the texture of sand.  {yRowanwood{n is straight and stiffer, covered in
striated bark.  {yMagnolia{n is thick and somewhat chunky, covered in grey,
smooth bark.  {yWillow{n branches are long and whippy, with leaves (stripped
off, in the drawing) at regular intervals on the smooth, glosy bark. 
{yRedwood{n has peeling strips of reddish bark.  {yTeak{n twigs are drawn
with thick pale brown bark, and slightly curved and irregular.  {yOak{n
twigs, straight and stiff, are covered with smooth brown bark. 
{yApplewood{n branches are gnarled and bent, covered with rough, dark bark. 
The {ybeech{n branches, straight and whippy, have a glossy brown covering. 
{ySycamore{n branches are a pure, velvety white.  {yMaple{n twigs, often
confused with rowan, appear to be slightly thinner, and branch more often. 
Finally, a thick stem of swamp{ygrass{n is shown beside the rest.  
~
E
shaping~
This section is drawn without the aid of words or labels.  It shows the
shaping of various frameworks from thin pieces of cut wood, tied into shape
with bits of thread: 
  
The {ycircle{n is formed by notching one side of the branch many times
lightly, at regular intervals.  Interlocking slots are carved into the ends
and bent together, the smaller notches helping the wood to bend without
splintering.  Wet sinew is bound in a tight wrapping around the two ends,
then allowed to dry.  
  
The {ysquare{n is formed by cutting three diagonal slashes in the branch,
then twisting each at a ninety-degree angle.  Interlocking slots are carved
at the ends, and four short frappings of sinew secure each of the corners at
a forty-five degree angle.  
  
The {ytriangle{n is formed in the exact same manner as the square, only with
three sides and two slashes.  However, triple-knotted bands of sinew are
tied around the middle of each side, and a single knot tied at each vertice.
The {ypentagon{n is formed in a manner similar to the circle; five deep
parallel slashes allow the wood to be bent severely into a five-sided shape,
with five additional shallower notches make each side bow outwards ever so
slightly.  The standard slotted ends are bound together, and a five-threaded
braid of sinew used to hold them shut.  
  
The {ystar{n is unique in that it actually requires the twig to be cut
into five short sections.  Complex slots fit the lengths together, and
double knots hold the five inner joints closed.  The five outer vertices are
secured with double loops of braided thread.
~
E
knotting~
This section is drawn entirely without words; detailed diagrams show the
construction and ways of tying simple knot configurations within a wooden
framework.  Eight different designs are shown: 
  
The {yvertical line{n is rather simple.  Three skeins of thread are braided
in an irregular, slight spiral, with knots placed at every thirteenth
crossover.  
  
The {yhorizontal line{n is formed by a square braid of thread, knotted into
a stiff line, and tied, obviously, horizontally into its frame.  
  
The {ydouble fork{n shows a quadruple-thickness length of thread rising from
the bottom of the framework, splitting once halfway up, and then again into
the four individual threads three-quarters of the way up.  Knots are tied
into the midpoint of each branch.  
  
The {ytriple fork{n begins with nine threads, splitting three times.  No
knots beyond the structural ones are tied into this configuration.  
  
The {yknotted circle{n is formed by a double-thickness of thread, spun
tightly together through the fingers and knotted tightly at regular
intervals.  Thirteen thin, short lengths of thread stretch it out inside its
framework, the topmost knotted three times.  
  
The {ydouble X{n shows two pairs of crossing diagonal lines, each slightly
overlapping.  Knots join the x\@s at any point at which they overlap.  
  
The {ylopsided square{n is fashioned in much the same way as the circle: a
double-spun skein is pulled into an intentionally skewed rough square by
thirteen single threads.  
  
The {ydiagonal line{n is a simple diagonal line, stretching from upper-right to
lower-left.  Two knots are tied at the center.
~
E
stiff chart~
This large chart appears to have been used for a demonstration on the
construction of some kind of simple wooden ch arm.  It is split into three
sections: a section on {ymaterials{n, a piece on {yknotting{n, and a piece
on {yshaping{n.  The chart is entirely pictographical; no words of any kind
are used.  You might {ystudy{n any given section.

E
large display rack weaponry~
This open-fronted display case is entirely devoted to a thorough sampling
of mankind\@s weaponry throughout the ages.  Systematically organized in
chronological succession, the display holds chipped-flint axes and
pre-Columbian obsidian-toothed swords, oak- and ash-hafted spears of Greek
and Roman make, Persian scimitars and falchions, Samburu throwing spears,
assegai, Tibetan phurpa, French misericords, throwing-sticks, blowpipes, and
shuriken.  The display moves on through rapiers, broadswords, foils, sabres,
claymores, katanas, and other broad-edged weapons.  Bows both hand-drawn,
mechanically-wound, and everything in between are shown beside an impressive
array of pike- and bill-heads.  Hand-axes of Norman, Saxon, Algonquian,
Zulu, and Mongolian make mingle with maces and staves.  An exhaustive study
of firearms finishes the display, from the earliest French hand-gonnes to
Colt automatic carbines; however, the collector\@s predilection for shotguns
shows through here, with a Remington 1170 Over-Under prominently displayed. 
Finally, an odd collection of the more miscellaneous weapons, or those which
defied classification, rounds off the case: whips, sjambok, bayonets,
grenades, caltraps, bolo, and an odd pair of shiny black leather industrial
boots seem almost cramped on their individual stands.

E
polished mahogany bar solid tap taps bottle bottles neat lines~
This solid mahogany bar is polished to a dull gleam, smelling faintly of
lemon oil and alcohol.  The front has been subtly carved with the faintest
of reliefs, depicting various scenes of a falconer with a small bird of
prey.  Several comfortable stools sit in front of the bar, thick leather
cushions worn just-so after many years of service.  At one end of the bar, a
colorful row of taps protrude over the top of the bar, obviously biased
towards darker lagers, stouts, and porters.  An impressive array of liquors
are lined neatly, each bottle in its individual shelf in a long row just
below the surface of the bar.  
~
E
cage~
This large cage sits mostly in shadow, the close-set thin bars painted a
matte black.  A jumble of cardboard boxes sits among several hanging
hammocks, the bottom covered with sweet-smelling aspen shavings; all in all,
the perfect habitat for the two small rats within.  The rats seem to always
be sleeping, curled up together in an emptied tissue box.  Cute and fuzzy,
they are tangled endearingly up with one another, dreaming sweet rattie
dreams.  
~
E
dark painting paintings~
Several dark paintings hang on the southern wall, Picasso\@s scribbled
depiction of Don Quixote seeming to be the most celebrated of the lot.  The
rest seem to be selected for their photorealism and classical lines: mostly
Northern Italian Renaissance, a single work by Manet, Vermeer, and an El
Greco apiece have snuck in as well.

A High, Black Hall~
You are in a tall hallway which stretches into darkness to the east and
west.  Pitch black, the room is painted with a matte finish, smooth to the
touch, which seems to actively absorb light.  Plain and unadorned, no
window, carving, or tapestry breaks the blank perfection of the walls.  High
above, a curving, vaulted ceiling is vaguely visible in the oppressive
gloom.  The floor is made of unpolished basalt, completing the motif of
disorienting, muffling darkness.  Cool and still, the heavy air seems to
dampen your senses.  To the south, a tall stone door stands, firmly shut.

Squatting in the center of the room is a low block of stone.

This tall door is a perfectly-proportioned rectangle, over ten feet in
height.  The top is formed into a rounded arch, the geometrically perfect
hemicircle curving above.  Clearly quite heavy, the door\@s only
distinguishing mark is a plain iron ring to aid with opening and closing.

E
irregularity keyhole key hole dot darker~
This small, irregular hole pierces the center of the circle.  Apparently
a keyhole of some sort, the wiggling line matches a key of some great

etched into the surface surrounding the keyhole.  
~
E
simple dull iron flat circle~
This simple ring of flat black iron is affixed firmly to the smooth,
unpolished rock.  A small, darker dot in the center catches your eye.  The
air about the circle is noticeably colder, drawing the heat away.

A Silent Library~
The walls of this room are vaguely hexagonal, curved slightly.  The lines
of the room seem somehow ...wrong, perhaps built to a radically different
aesthetic.  Wandering rows of scroll-filled racks meander across the dull
floor, each scroll resting neatly in its own slot.  The room is oppressively
dark.  A curved ceiling stands about an alatharya\@s height off the floor. 
For what seems to be a reading room, the lack of lighting or seating seems
strange.  Seeming at first to be a shadow, a dark smudge on the ceiling
attracts your gaze a moment.  An open archway leads to a curved stairwell to
the east, and curtained doorways permit egress to the north, south, and
west.

shadow dark smudge ceiling~
Difficult to pick out exactly due to the slightly darker lines on the
black matte ceiling, this smudgy mark proves to be in fact a series of
delicate, swirling lines, grouped in odd clouds and indistinct nebulae of
etched lines.  Sprawling aimlessly, they all seem part of an ordered whole,
yet what the whole is is unclear.  A sense of focus, a determined purpose,
seems to roll off of the odd inscriptions.  
~
E
rack racks scroll wandering row rows~
These racks dominate the room, standing several feet in height.  Made
from a charcoal-black undetermined substance, they are cool to the touch,
and neat pairs of hooks provide resting-places for the many scrolls which
fill them.  The scrolls seem to be organized chronologically, judging by the
aging of the parchments.  After some study, the racks seem to be divided
into three sections.  You may look at the first, second, or third.

A Large Laboratory~
This large room of pure black stone holds several stone counters and two
fixed tables, as well as rack of vials and tubes.  Stretching to the east
and west, the low room appears to be some sort of laboratory.  The equipment
seems to center about the tables, the central fixtures of this room.  A
dull, unpolished floor is immaculately clean, and the various racks seem
well-organized and neatly labeled, though in what language is uncertain. 
The floor is slightly sloped, leading down to a shallow trough which runs
the length of the center of the room.  Completely unlit, the room gives a
general impression of military attention to detail, each item set precisely
out and ready for use.  Curtained portals lead to the east, south, and west.

of each of the tables, needles, blades, lenses, and countless other fixtures
of unknown purpose kept in clean working preparation.  A small side
receptacle holds a small round jar, connected to a leather tube.

A Jar-Filled Room~
This square room, done in the same muffling black stone as the rest of
the keep, is completely unilluminated.  The pitch black room is filled with
shelves packed floor-to-ceiling with countless jars, each neatly labeled
vessel containing a pair of floating eyes.  Of every size and color, these
macabre specimens stare unseeing from every angle.  A hanging scroll against
a far shelf and a large chart covering the only open wallspace are the only
other items in the room of note.  A curtain-covered portal leads out of the
room to the west.

A large, highly detailed drawing of some round object sliced open

This grotesque collection is apparently in perfect condition, the
hundreds and hundreds of eyes protected from any form of decay.  Of all
sizes and colors, the eyes are preserved in a solution which, upon closer
inspection, turns out to be a pale pale pink.  Your light throws the
innumerable jars into changing, flickering shadows, causing them to wink and
blink with macabre energy.

Shelves cover almost every inch of wall space, save for the door and the

A Dusty Storeroom~
This room, built of the same muffling black stone as the rest of the
keep, does not seem to be as often visited as the others.  A thin layer of
dust covers everything, and grime has begun to accumulate in the corners. 
Several dark shapes wrapped in black silk rest on the shelves of this small
storeroom, and a few larger objects are protectively covered with dark
canvas.  The ceiling here is lower, the dark, velvet-smooth stone barely six

A small corridor leads from north to south, the black stone walls bare
and unadorned.  A faint metallic tang lingers in the air, filling your
nostrils and coating your tongue.  The air is cool and still, the close
passageway more oppressive than the expansive entry hall.  A curtained
portal leads to the north, and a heavy stone door sits in the western wall. 
To the south, the hall opens into a larger space -- with the stifling

A round table sits in the center of this room, laden with an intricate
assemblage of glass pipettes, beakers, and tubes.  Around the edges of the
black-walled room three smaller such workstations can be seen.  The floor is
slightly sloped, the dully reflective black floor slanted towards a row of
drains against the western wall.  A large tap protrudes from the southern
wall, a metal wheel atop it.  An open doorway to the north leads out of the
room, and the southeastern corner of the room is occupied by the curvature
of an enclosed spiral stairwell which ascends to the next floor of the
castle.  A plain door stands in the wall to the west.

apparent.  The entire assemblage is immaculately clean inside and out.  A
few small burners crackle away underneath several of the flasks, blue-green
flames oddly casting no light of their own.

A Partitioned Cell~
This round cell is quite tall, ceiling at least twelve feet in height. 
The dark black walls around you seem to actively absorb light, enforcing the
tenebrous gloom that lies heavy over the castle.  Honeycombed with small,
regular niches, the walls form a basic ovoid centered about a simple
pedestal in the middle of the dull floor.  A slightly vaulted ceiling joins
smoothly with the walls, also honeycombed with the same small rectangular
coffers.  

The western end of the room has taken considerable damage from some unknown
force, the thick stone smashed inward as if by a blow.  The resultant hole
is roughly three feet in diameter, a crude circle.  Debris of crumbled stone
and twisted metal lies scattered in the western end of the room, littering
the floor.

This odd chamber seems to have built with complete disregard for any
standard concept of floor, ceiling, or wall.  Amorphous, the apparent random
room structure flows and curves in some places while in others corners and
lines form entirely independently.  Several equally serendipitous lines wind

Though they allude to a sense of purpose, their function is not immediately

actively absorbed, and the chill air has a density of its own.  The corridor
passes through open doorways at the northern and southern ends.  A recessed
doorway stands to the east, the solid combination of metal and stone fitted
with a thick, sliding handle.

This dark room of black stone is dominated by a long, U-shaped table. 
Around it curves a bench of the same matte stone as the walls and ceiling. 
The air is heavy and still, and the walls seem to actively dampen light and

This simple geometric seal consists of a thick ring, containing two

center of the room.  About the seal, the two ends of the table reach out.  
~
E
eastern~
Fashioned of dusty green jade, this bust shows a tranquil, placid face. 
Heavy-lidded eyes stare with a blank calm, and the thin cheeks are calm and
untroubled by wrinkle or emotion.  A hooked nose and thin, expressionless
mouth sit above a narrow chin.  The forehead is high, with no visible hair. 
Pointed ears flank the head, flat and unseemly.  
~
E
northern~
This simple bust is made from a pale, milky marble.  Translucent and
pure, the stone is free of imperfection or striation.  The bust portrays a
nondescript humanoid face with wide-set eyes and a strong chin.  A coarse,
broken nose sits uneasily over a thin mouth.

A Bare Kitchen~
This long, rectanglar room is as oppressively dark as the rest of the
keep.  Two ovens and several long counters are made of the same black stone
as the walls and ceiling.  A large sink stands against the northern wall. 
Hanging from the ceiling, an iron rack holds several pots and pans.  The air
is cool and still and somehow seems thicker here.  A smooth black floor is
covered with an odd, rubbery grid, making the footing quite stable.  To the
north, a short hallway leads out of the kitchen.

This room is perfectly spherical, the black stone walls marred only by

and a sunken floor of equal smoothness mirrors the curvature of the ceiling.
The room is spotless and clean.  A small object floats in the geometric
center of the room.  The curved door stands open, fashioned to complete the

This room is bare and empty, small accumulations of dust visible in the

stone, the room\@s oppressive blankness seems to press in on you.  Two chairs
are bolted to the floor here, facing each other.  Spaced about a foot apart,
the simple metal chairs are plain and unadorned.  The air is chill and close
here, eerily calm and still.  An open doorway leads into darkness to the

sturdy metal bunks, each triple-tiered bed bolted securely to the floor and

neatly at the foot of each immaculate bunk.  A heavy, muffling curtain of
dark grey wool hangs in the doorway to the west.  The floor is as perfectly

This dark room of matte black stone appears to have been an office of
some sorts.  Two long desks stand in front of the northern and western
walls, the lacquered wooden tops covered with chips and bits of stone.  The
dully reflective basalt floor bears several cracks, all beginning from a
narrow fissure in the western wall.  The air is chill and oddly still, a
heavy tang of salt thick in the air.  The ceiling has buckled in several
small pieces near the western wall, the slabs of broken stone seeming
relatively unstable.  A small, wooden door stands to the south, and an open
doorway leads east.

This square cell is quite small, just over a pace\@s width per side.  An
open doorway to the east leads back into the bunkroom.  The matte-black
walls are smooth to the touch, and seem to dampen light and sound.  A few
weapons are arranged neatly in racks and hooks on the northern and southern
walls, but almost all seem to be gone.  A semicircular alcove in the western
wall is fronted by a slender iron grille.  Not even a room in its own right,
the small space is fitted with a curving rack.

This stairwell curves sharply above you.  Steep stone steps are coated
with an oddly firm substance, rendering the likelihood of slipping very
small.  The walls are a smooth, matte black.  A plain metal rail, enamelled

circular shaft containing a sharply-spiralling staircase twists out of sight

The floor is a dull, slightly polished black stone, as smooth as glass. 
Short corridors lead to the west and north.  Two small alcoves sit in the

hollow cheeks are stretched tightly over the bones, and the chin is a sharp,

nose.  The scalp is wrinkled, and careful etching has covered the top of the

This life-sized bust depicts an aelin face.  Fashioned from finely
translucent alabaster, the milky white stone is masterfully chiseled, shaped
and polished.  The bust depicts a cold, regal face, with an aquiline nose
and hollow cheeks.  Delicately pointed ears seem almost fragile, and the
remarkably lifelike hair is bound back from the face with a simple thong. 
The eyes are blank, their round smoothness untouched by the sculpture. 
Somehow their bare lack of detail expresses a chilling sense of patient,
ageless -life-.

A Suspended Walkway~
This long, narrow walkway is barely seven feet in width.  The stone here
is a uniform, speckled dark granite, the blocks joined with a rubbery black
mortar.  Here, some attention seems to have been paid to the decor, and a
few simple faux columns are carved into the walls.  Between these, long,
narrow archer\@s slits line the walls to the north and south.  Through these
slits a field of flickering, inconstant nothingness can be seen, painful
transience stormy and capricious.  The walkway seems to vibrate slightly, as
if in a high wind, but the air is as oppressively still and silent as in the
rest of the keep, seemingly oblivious to the raging Change outside.  A
sealed door stands in the wall to the west.

A Suspended Walkway~
This long, narrow walkway is barely seven feet in width.  The stone here
is a uniform, speckled dark granite, the blocks joined with a rubbery black
mortar.  Here, some attention seems to have been paid to the decor, and a
few simple faux columns are carved into the walls.  Between these, long,
narrow archer\@s slits line the walls to the north and south.  Through these
slits a field of flickering, inconstant nothingness can be seen, painful
transience stormy and capricious.  The walkway sways perceptibly here,
rocking slightly as though being beaten by powerful gale-force winds.  Oddly
enough, the air is as oppressively still and heavy as the rest of the
castle, and the eerie silence goes unbroken.

rest of the keep, seemingly oblivious to the raging Change outside.  A
sealed door stands in the wall to the east.

A Dark Tower Room~
This square room of black stone tapers slightly towards the ceiling. 
The floor is a dull, slightly polished black stone, as smooth as glass. 
Short corridors lead to the west and north, each terminating in a door.  The
door to the west is thick and heavy-looking, apparently a hinged slab of
stone.  Trimmed at the edges with an odd, rubbery substance, the door is
secured with a solid latch.  The door to the north is far less intimidating,
simple dark wood with a small, muffled latch.

A Simple Office~
This office is made in keeping with the stark emptiness of the rest of
the castle.  Bare stone walls with a smooth black finish support an equally
bare ceiling.  A plain desk is comprised of two large blocks of stone with a
slab of lacquered black wood across them.  Harsh and ascetic, a metal,
straight-backed chair fits into the kneehole.  Against the far wall a small
metal cabinet sits, hinges and doors muffled with soft velvet.  

Some unknown force has damaged the southeast corner of the room, ripping a
yawning gap in the wall.  Some small volume of stone debris is spilled out
across the floor.

yawning gap~
This sizeable gap has been caused by the collapse or smashing of the
southeastern wall.  Raw edges of ruined stone frame a large hole, and you
can see into the antechamber to the south through a few tiny chinks. 
Filling the rent is a flurry of transience, the terrible inconstancy causing
your vision to ache.  Sullen grey fields of nothingness are overlaid with
flashes of a ruined courtyard.  Even as you watch, the image of the same
courtyard, though silent and undamaged, flashes in and out of view.  

A daring soul might perhaps try and ENTER this gap.
~
E
desk lacquered black wood blocks~
This simple desk is merely a tabletop of thick black lacquered wood
supported by two cubes of stone several feet to a side.  

Several small pieces of parchment sit on the desk.  You may look at the
first, second, third, or fourth.

A Ruined Antechamber~
This black room is small, a simple stone bench sitting against the
southern wall.  The entire northeastern corner of the antechamber is ruined,
lying in a large pile of stones and beams.  An arched doorway to the north
is mostly blocked by the caved in debris, a simple emblem of a semicircle
chiseled over the top.  An open doorway leads to the rest of the tower to
the west.  

Through the little unblocked space left by the collapse, one can see
swirling nothingness, dark flashes of transience suffusing the achingly
inconstant background.

This large mound of stone and other construction debris has poured in

door to the north, wedging it shut.  Perhaps with effort one could {WDIG{n
the door out.

A Dark Tower Room~
This square room of black stone tapers slightly towards the ceiling.  The
floor is a dull, slightly polished black stone, as smooth as glass.  A short
corridor leads to the north, ending in a flat black door fitted with a
small, muffled latch.  To the east, a small, open doorway leads into an
antechamber.  The air is thick and heavy here, possessing a palpable weight
even greater than other rooms in the castle.  Cool and eerily still, it
smells faintly of metal and the salty stink of blood.  A set of chains hangs
from the center of the ceiling here, the strong iron links of blackened iron
ending in thick manacles.  A mirroring pair lie in a pile below, affixed to
the floor.

A Pitch-Black Shaft~
Carved into the very rock of the hills, a great circular shaft many
meters in diameter drops away into black depths far below.  A narrow
staircase of pale, sickly marble winds about the perfectly smooth grey stone
walls of the shaft, spiralling downward as far as the one can see.  Above,
the stairs gradually widen, stopping beneath the outline of the tomblike
entrance which caps the shaft.  Pitch black, the air in the abyssal shaft is
chill and eerily still and stagnant, despite the vast open space.

The Bottom of a Deep Reservoir~
You are in a large room, made from coarse, clean blocks of granite.  The
top of the cell narrows to a shaft, stretching far above you.  It is
noticeably cold down here, and a clammy humidity tinges the air with an
almost earthy smell.  Three small holes a few inches in diameter can be seen
several feet off of the floor.  A few small puddles have formed on the stone
underneath you, and the walls and floor are damp.

These three holes in the sides of the shaft stand about five feet off of

explorative poking or prying.  The edges of the holes are significantly
smoother than the coarse rock around them, indicating long, continual wear.

On both sides of this narrow band of limestone the solid, smooth granite
resumes.

The Bottom of an Abyssal Shaft~
This great circular shaft ends its immeasurable drop here, the vast
diameter slowly narrowing to a rounded bottom.  A staircase of pale, sickly
marble widens to adjust for the irregularity of the walls as it winds to the
bottom.  Above, the stairs narrow and spiral out of sight into blackness. 
Pitch black, the air in the abyssal shaft is chill and eerily still, despite
the vast open space.  Carved out of the living black rock to the east is a
massive archway, several paces wide and many more tall.  It is from this
plain portal that the faint blue light emanates, the source yet unseen. 
Even the reflected glow is dazzlingly bright after the lack of illumination
above.

An Arched, Sloping Tunnel~
This vast tunnel slopes downwards to the east, hewn from the rough,
living black rock.  The floor is made of the same gritty black stone.  The
high ceiling is arched, curving at least ten meters above the floor.  To the
west, the tunnel opens out into the abyssal shaft.  The tunnel stretches
down into the bowels of the earth to the east, the blue glow gaining in
reflected intensity.  The air here is still and heavy, but possessing a
frigid energy not felt in the upper reaches of the shaft.  The air seems to
grow more alive to the east, as it nears the source of the light.

This vast tunnel continues its slope downwards to the east, hewn from the
rough, living black rock.  The floor is made of the same gritty black stone.
The high ceiling arches at least ten meters above the floor.  To the west,
the tunnel runs for some distance, eventually opening out into the abyssal
shaft.  The tunnel turns into the bowels of the earth to the north, the blue
glow gaining in reflected intensity.  The air here is still and heavy, a
frigid, palpable energy thick about you.  The air seems to grow more alive
to the north, as the tunnel opens into a cavernous underground chamber.

An Immense Chamber~
The tunnel opens into a vast chamber here, the rough black walls widening
and stretching up beyond the limit of your vision.  No ceiling is visible to
the gargantuan chamber, inky blackness hovering above the immense space like
an uneasy stormcloud.  A low, swirling vortex of mist rotates slowly to your
north, rising as it approaches the center of the room.  At the middle of the
vortex, the mists curl and twist in on themselves, focusing about a bright,
cold blue light.  The tunnel opening stands back to the south, dark compared
to the light of the chamber.  A tangible energy tingles in the air,
emanating from the mist-obscured source of the light.  The floor is cracked
and very uneven, the black stone furrowed and crumpled in many places.

A Vortex of Fog~
You are in a swirling, disorienting bank of opaque mist.  Dry and almost
dusty, the heavy grey fog is oppressively close on every side.  A bath of
almost intolerably bright blue light suffuses the mist here, having no
apparent source.  A rough, broken floor below provides inconstant footing
for the unwary.  Occasional glimpses of a massive, ceilingless chamber can
be partially gleaned through the odd lessening of the fog.

You are in a tall hallway which stretches into darkness to the east and
west.  Pitch black, the room is painted with a matte finish, smooth to the
touch, which seems to actively absorb light.  Plain and unadorned, no
window, carving, or tapestry breaks the blank perfection of the walls.  High
above, a curving, vaulted ceiling is vaguely visible in the oppressive
gloom.  The floor is made of unpolished basalt, completing the motif of
disorienting, muffling darkness.  Cool and still, the heavy air seems to
dampen your senses.  To the south, a tall stone door stands, firmly shut.

Though it is shut fast, the door shows evidence of having been forced,

A Large Alcove~
This large alcove is hewn out of the living black rock, here at the very
roots of the earth.  The walls are sufficiently uneven to make the nature of
this side chamber unsure; whether artificial or natural, you cannot tell.  A
large block of stone stands at the back of the alcove.  To the south, the
walls open out abruptly, expanding into an immense chamber.  A harsh, cold
blue glow streams into the black alcove, coming from somewhere within the
swirling, twisting mists.

Among A Whirling Field of Transience~
You fall without weight amidst spinning flurries of nothingness, the
bruised darkness suffused with flickering flashes of something not quite
light.  Nothing is visible but for the swirling shards of reality which
twist about and through you.  It is completely silent, yet all your other
senses give the impression of falling through a frenzied, wild tempest.  The
numbing cold surrounds you like no earthly ice might, tearing at your very
essence.

A Ruined Laboratory~
This low room appears to be a laboratory of some sort.  Counters run
around the walls, and a cabinet full of shattered, dusty dishes hangs on the
western wall.  A similar cabinet full of shards of glass hangs on the
northern wall.  In the southern corner a number of simple woodworking tools
lie, rusted and decayed beyond repair or usefulness: an adze, a plane, and a
lathe can be seen among the jumble of less-recognizeable implements.  The
floor is laced with a network of thick cracks which shift and groan wherever
weight is placed on them.  Several large containers of black metal are lined
up on the counter to the east, and a broad spool of dark thread is mounted
on the wall behind them.  Dirty, mouldering sawdust and long, curling wood
shavings litter the shattered floor in piles.

E
floor down sawdust pile piles shaving shavings~
The black stone floor is laced with thick, dark cracks, broken by some
immense shock or concussion.  The floor seems to be held together with
something slightly flexible - bars of metal reinforcing the stone, perhaps -
but it shifts and grinds ominously whenever weight is put on it.  A thick
coating of sawdust and shavings covers the floor in irregular clumps.  
~
E
adze plane lathe implement implements~
These appear to be a series of commonplace woodworking tools; an adze, a
lathe, a plane, and several types of carving and nurling knives.  All are
corroded and decayed into a state of uselessness.  
~
E
north~
This cabinet is carved from stained black wood, the door having fallen
off long ago.  It is filled with useless shards of glass equipment, some of
which have spilled out onto the floor.  The force which broke the glassware
seems to have been sudden and brutal, as the pieces are quite fragmented,
the bottommost reduced to a gritty powder.  
~
E
west~
This cabinet is carved from stained black wood, the door having fallen
off long ago.  It is filled with useless shards of crockery and other
laboratory equipment.  They appear to have been stacked neatly before
breaking, as though they were all shattered simultaneously.  
~
E
cabinet~
There are two cabinets, one to the west and one to the north.  
~
E
broad spool dark thread~
This spool is several inches wide, mounted on a cast iron bracket.  It
contains a great deal of dark, leathery thread.  If you desired, you could
{ymeasure{n a length of the {ysinew{ny thread and cut it off.
~
E
container containers counter east~
Over a dozen large, cylindrical bins of black metal sit on the counter to
the east.  Each one is filled with hundreds of thin twigs, each apparently
from a different kind of common tree.  An emblem of each tree\@s leaf is
hammered into each container.  You can {yget{n a {ytwig{n of: holly, rowan,
magnolia, willow, redwood, teak, oak, applewood, beech, sycamore, maple, or
a tough strand of thick grass.

A Suspended Walkway~
This long, narrow walkway is barely seven feet in width.  The stone here
is a uniform, speckled dark granite, the blocks joined with a rubbery black
mortar.  Here, some attention seems to have been paid to the decor, and a
few simple faux columns are carved into the walls.  Between these, long,
narrow archer\@s slits line the walls to the north and south.  Through these
slits a field of flickering, inconstant nothingness can be seen, painful
transience stormy and capricious.  The walkway sways perceptibly here,
rocking slightly as though being beaten by powerful gale-force winds.  Oddly
enough, the air is as oppressively still and heavy as the rest of the
castle, and the eerie silence goes unbroken.
