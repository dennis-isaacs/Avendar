Welcome to the Tower of Testing!
 
Here, your mettle will be tested in physical combat. 
 
If the foes here prove to hard for you, you can always get
away from combating by using the FLEE command.
 
None of the monsters on the first floor will attack you first,
or start a fight with you.
 
If you really get in trouble, you can use the RECALL command, which
will take you to a temple in town.

WARNING!
 
The monsters on the second floor of the tower are sometimes known
to be aggressive.
 
Monsters here will also chase you, so be wary. You might FLEE
into an aggressive one, and then have two on your trail!
 
Fortunately, the first floor is protected by a spell which will
prevent these monsters from following you down the stairs.
 
Be on the lookout for the Hall of Challenges here, and remember,
if you get in trouble or get lost, you can always RECALL.

The guardian blocks the way to the south, holding the key

Many traps will await you in the world at large, so it\@s 
important you pay attention to your surroundings. One
way you can do that is to always LOOK in a direction
before you head there. Simply type: 
 
LOOK <direction>
 
to see if there\@s anything interesting in a given direction.
 
In this case, something seems to be suspicious. Maybe if you

Templars: Templars are warriors who have trained in the ways and means of
combining sword and spell.  Unlike scholars, who diversify in their studies,
templars only major in one sphere of elemental influence.  Known far and
wide as some of the greatest leaders Avendar has produced, templars are
often seen leading the charge into battle, or directing the forces of
varying factions.  Due to the amount of time spent studying other matters,
the alignment and ethos of a templar must be resonant with their elemental
sphere.
