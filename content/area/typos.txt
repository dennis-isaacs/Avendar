[26630] Izeren: the begins to clench and unclench its claws echo of the hideous gargoyle has a typo - it says the hideous gargoyle the hideous gargoyle... rest of echo (repeating the name of the mob twice).

[ 7749] Vibolan: On the webpage fighters still have no lunge, although I think they have the skill.
