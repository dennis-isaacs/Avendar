Terintbanch Plun~
Terintbanch is here bending pieces of metal and wood to his will.
~
Terintbanch Plun works quietly in his shop, shaping hoops of metal and
then binding them about the wooden frameworks of a wheel.  His apron is
marred in several places from hot coals jumping from his oven, pieces of
iron snapping back into his body, or splinters of wood breaking off.  A
strong man, Plun is wiry and muscular, bare forearms crisscrossed with old
burns.  Bright, observant eyes of a light brown watch his work intently, a
preoccupied smile forming on his face from time to time.

Toromia~
Toromia, an amalgam of flesh, gear, and magic, shuffles about her workshop.
~
Toromia is, at first glance, not mortal at all; many portions of her body
have been replaced by interlocking metal gears, solid rods, and securing
harnesses.  Beneath her many artificial enhancements, she was once human,
although if her transformation was willing or not is quite unclear.  Her
right arm, in particular, is entirely synthetic-- a crackle of negative
energy courses its central rods to animate its motion.  With one eye covered
by a prominent ruby lens, she both refurbishes disposable helpers for
adventurers, and instructs those inclined to her methods.

Aldred~
A haggard-looking man drowns his sorrows in a bottle of whisky.

This young man sits alone, gazing morosely at the empty tumblers which
litter the table\@s surface.  It seems that some time ago he chose to forego
the more civilized intermediary of the glass, and now drinks directly from
the whisky bottle.  He wears the fine clothing of a successful merchant,
although looks (and smells) as though he hasn\@t changed them in days.

Irrasa portly caladaran woman scholar~
Irrasa~
A portly caladaran scholar is here, carefully studying a scroll.
~
Irrasa is a short, stout caladaran scholar-turned-historian.  Her long,
reedy hair and thin limbs give her a bulbous appearance, which is only
nominally lessened by her deep purple robes.  She works slowly in her small
abode, hands slowly reaching for this scroll or that.  Her voice is thin and
high, her cheeks puffing out a bit when she chooses to speak.  She has a
reputation for identifying items brought to her for a fee, using the
proceeds to pay for her endless research.

A burly ethron mercenary paces about his office.

This ethron has retired from adventuring to aid the guards of Var Bandor.
Now working as a mercenary captain, he looks to hire adventurers to collect
bounties on bandits and criminals plaguing the countryside.  His green skin

say I hear Pyzick is looking for help on occassion. He lives on Arcanos street in southern Var Bandor.
say Also, if you don\@t mind some shadier work-
say There are those looking for help in the thief hideouts under Earendam.
say Also, seeing as you\@re getting the knack of scalp hunting, you could go to Krilin.
say Krilin has a bounty out on hill giant scalps. Lieutenant Retli is in charge of that at the fortress.

say You may have heard, but there is a group of srryn reavers in the North Forest.
say These reavers have been setting upon caravans taking the Earendam Road between Kor Thrandir and Earendam.
say They are led by a fierce srryn known as Nthenhk.
say And the powers that be have put out a price on his scalp.
say Now, finding him is the trick. His encampment is said to be in the North Forest between the Earendam Road and the Brintor Road.
say There is a dangerous marsh there as well, full of vicious snakes. Probably best to avoid it.
say But if you are near it, you are also near their camp.
say He won\@t be alone, so it is probably a good idea to get the help of other adventurers.
say When you have the scalp, bring it to me.
say Keep in mind- you want any guild experience out of this, you should complete this before your 31st rank.
say Good luck.

note + 
note + {W1. Please tell us the basics of the jewelry.{x

note + sort of item it should be (such as a ring, earrings, spectacles, etc).
note + 
note + {W2. Please tell us some general statistics.{x
note + 
note + General statistics will allow us to give you an accurate quote on what you

note + means that we do not want exact stats.  The stats you request are suggestions,
note + so please don\@t be too over the top with this.  Also, do not format your
note + request in the form of the identify spell.
note + 
note + {W3. Let us know your budget.{x
note + 
note + Let us know how much money you are willing to spend at the absolute maximum.
note + This way we can make sure that your item is as good as it can be for the price
note + you are willing and able to spend.
note + 
note + {W4. Describe your item.{x
note + 
note + When describing your item, this can be as simple or detailed as you\@d like.  It
note + can be as simple as \#I want a ring that is silver and covered with mystical
note + sigils and warm to the touch\#, or it can be an actual description.  However, be
note + advised that we may adjust the description you write to ensure its quality.
note + We promise we\@ll do our best.
note + 
note + {W5. Remember that Psentil is a jeweler.{x
note + 
note + Items that are not jewelry may be rejected because, well, they aren\@t jewelry.
note + Psentil is not an armorsmith or a weaponsmith, so try to be reasonable in terms
note + of what he can feasibly create.
note + 
note + Once you have provided the above information, we will get back to you with a
note + quote and any further options that may be available.  If you have any questions

This middle-aged nefortu has a relaxed, confident, and knowing air about

face half in shadow.  The nefortu\@s substantial paunch hints at a relatively
sedate lifestyle.  His ears are, unlike the rest of him, upright and almost
quivering at the ready, as if straining to catch or overhear any discussion
in the bar.

the shade of Azurik~
The shade of a dark nefortu hovers in the shadows.
~
You take sight of a slender, ethereal figure clad in equally ethereal
supple, black leathers which appear bound and buckled tightly to his small,
wiry frame.  A seemingly weightless hooded cloak of the same dull color
drapes down around his body, resting just above the ground.  Most of his
attire is quite oversized, which gives him a clumsy and awkward appearance. 
His small childlike face is free of any flaws or marks, and a pair of empty
black eyes shimmer with memories of youthful exuberance.  Stretching above
and to either side of the figure, a set of bat-like wings are adorned with
several small holes and tears in the webbing.

Grimly hovering about this place, this shade of a long-deceased shuddeni,
in ages past known as the Blade of Law, is absorbed in its own memories.  A
pale, ghostly light clings to its ethereal form, visible only to your
enhanced senses.  Though already translucent, with each passing moment the
wrinkled shade seems to grow slightly fainter.  The dark intent of its
presence is still palpable, even in death.

Kzikzuu Zuk~
The nefortu Kzikzuu Zuk lurks about, waiting for customers.
~
This burly-chested nefortu, rather pop-eyed, seems possessed with nervous
energy.  Short, fine, brindle fur - mottled in tan, umber, and black patches
- covers his leathery skin.  Burn weals, some faded, some shiny, further
piebald his countenance.  His large, expressive ears -- long, tufty, and
pointed -- seem physically incapable of pointing in the same direction,
gyrating, twitching, and flexing in a constant, distracting dance.

A sandy-haired woman sits here nervously.

A chubby human girl rests here, clad in the bulky, unembellished robes
of an acolyte.  Ringlets of sandy-coloured hair crown her, obscuring her
ears as they frame her pudgy face.  Swirling some wine in a glass, a forlorn
expression is writ across her features, mirrored in the melancholy gaze of
her large, brown eyes.

>data_prog removal_instructions~
If you need to remove an item from the auction, you *must* follow these instructions exactly: 

Pick up that item. 
Note what port you are on. 
hedit (port)-3469-auction-item-short. 
Using .d and the line number, delete the line that corresponds to the short desc of the item you picked up. 
Still using .d and the same line number, delete the corresponding line from the following helps: 
(port)-3469-auction-item-cost 
(port)-3469-auction-seller-real 
(port)-3469-auction-seller-public 

Once you have done that, force handlerbot to update_data. 

This will remove an item from the auction. If you do not follow these steps exactly, the auctions will break.

Guildmistress Qirnelvra~
Guildmistress Qirnelvra, leader of the Earth Scholars, studies a musty tome.
~
Guildmistress Qirnelvra is an elderly human woman with a dignified
comportment.  Though slender, she does not seem fragile--her bearing speaks
of a resilience and strength not usually found in those of advanced age. 
Her thick white hair is long, straight, and reaches down well past her
shoulders.  Knowing brown eyes peer through a small set of spectacles that
perch on her impressively aquiline nose, and her lips press almost permanently
in a thin line of concentration.  

She is dressed in the brown ceremonial robes of the Circle of Earth, the 
binding circle of the Var Bandor scholar faction.  Without Qirnelvra\@s 
diplomatic skills to aid cooperation, the various scholars could not have
functioned effectively as a whole, much less garner the amount of power 
and influence that they have in Var Bandor.

the scheme of the Var Bandor scholar faction.  Nizayan is mostly known for
the feats of his younger years, when he wielded storms and winds with a
mighty hand.  Now a bent old man, he nonetheless passes on his great

The templar guildmaster stands ready to teach young templars.
~
The Var Bandor scholar faction allows the admittance of templars into
their ranks, and thus they have included a templar guildmaster in their
education regimen.  Although it is widely known that the Var Bandor templars
have little say in the faction\@s doings, they are valued for their
combination of magic and combat skills.

A huge, red-scaled srryn blacksmith tends his shop.
~
A huge red-scaled srryn, Ysthet bears the lustreless look of the far
south.  His shoulders are broad and his protruding fangs are an unhealthy
yellow.  A blacksmith, he has muscled his way into this location after the
unexpected disappearance of its previous proprietor.  He is noteworthy in
that the armor he prepares is specifically suited to other srryn, miming the
styles and aesthetics of both Sythtys and the Crimson Sands.  His front
claws are blackened and damaged from his time working the forge.  Despite
his brutish temperment, he seems to do good business on Raddin Street,
enough to keep the Merchant Council happy.

Atarech~
A grizzled, scarred alatharya works within the shop.
~
Atarech is large and powerful looking alatharya who tends a cramped,
aging weapon store.  His face is particularly grizzled, with one of his eyes
permanently blinded by a battle injury.  His hair is short and messy, and
his powerful arms are lined with years of scars.  The history of his
barbaric life is one he is unwilling to share, and has instead devoted his
talents to creating weapons designed for alatharyan hands.  He has an
agreement with Geingaikh, allowing him to do his smithing there when
inventory runs low, making him a particularly shrewd negotiator for his
kind.  He works behind the counter, waiting to ply his deadly wares.

IF YOU MAKE CHANGES, BE SURE TO LEAVE EXACTLY 30 LINES BELOW (AND THIS ONE).
The way down to Jasa Lake is nearly cleared up, the dockmen are saying.
There is a priestess from the charitable order of Yamr in Var Bandor.  They say she\@ll feed young, hungry folk.
I was told that the mapmakers have finally updated the old Avendar map sold in Var Bandor.  About time!
Did you hear about that shuddeni Guardian getting caught taking bribes?  It\@s about time someone nailed him!
There is a tower of dark and evil magics in the mountains west of the wastes. Roads don\@t go there yet, thank the Gods!
The thief guild seems unusually active lately--it\@s getting so an honest person can\@t walk down the street.
Old Malner brought that Krilin lieutenant Retli the head of an ogre, and was given a single measly copper!
They say that only some folk can see the lightspires of Alensha.  No wonder no one can find the place.
Drink this, he said.  I looked in the cup, and it was verdah drippings.  What a bastard!
An alatharya had too much to drink--came in the other day spouting about an arch in the wastes that hid ancient ruins.
A party of cursebreakers went out to the Nordath ruins.  None returned. What were they thinking?
This new change in the currency--its really hitting the poor folk hard.
I found the cave high up in the Brintors.  Inside there was a chest filled with armor!
Bromrin, the Bandor guard captain, couldn\@t think his way out of a paper bag.
The Knights are fewer in number lately.  Problems with the leadership, or so I hear.
Yeah, when he saw that ch\@taren heal the shuddeni, beer shot out his nose!  Gods, that was a sight!
I\@ve heard that the ethron clanchief Falirn is looking for adventurers to help remove a curse.
The Gods and Goddesses of mercy can be a fickle lot.  Don\@t put your faith in mercy.
Stay out of the tunnels in the northwestern end of Var Bandor, unless you like demons, pain, and death!
Have you heard that some folks are dying only once?  By all the Gods, that\@s just unnatural!
My uncle finally earned his medallion, so the guards hassle him less.
It was his first journey to the chaja caves.  His corpse and gear are probably still laying there, poor fellow.
I was given the vegetables freely from the monks in the monastery.  Then I sold them in town, ha!
I think someone is trying to listen in our our conversation.  Shhhhh!
Don\@t stray from the path in Nendor Forest.  You could end up a dragon\@s dinner.
There have been a lot of strange guild-types coming around the place lately, trying to... shhhhh!
Where have all the champions gone?  To the void, I hope.  They never did anything for me.
He put the tabard on--big mistake!  That thing, like the rest of the ruins, is cursed beyond cleansing.
I\@ve heard that some good folk are helping shuddeni that act nice.  Just as well kiss a cute piranha.
That rod is more than just the most powerful weapon south of the Brintors--it is the key to the Patrician\@s rule.

interest in just about every trade or commerce possible, and is quite
knowledgeable about each.  While approaching his fifties, Belegil has more
wisdom to compensate for his lack of youthful energy.  His mansion within
the heart of Var Bandor is the proud trophy of his mercantile power, helping
him showcase his success to all his fellow merchants and visitors.

snail large black cave~
a large cave snail~
A large black cave snail is oozing along.
~
The species of black cave snails are called such because of their black
shells.  They vary greatly in size, and this one fills almost the entirety
of this part of the catacombs.  The black cave snails are extremely rare due
to their need for underground places that are warm, dark, secluded, and with
just the right amount of underground vegetation for them to consume.  The
supposed aphrodisiacal value of their shells, once ground into potions, has
also led to them being a prized bounty by people seeking a quick profit.

Ghonst Ardon bartender alatharya burly~
Ghonst Ardon~
A burly alatharya works behind the bar.
~
This silver-stained alatharya named Ghonst Ardon has worn features and a
serious demeanor.  Apparently overworked, his uniform is slightly soiled
with food and grease.  Tall and broad-shouldered, he looks like he could
hold his own in a bar fight.  Something about the look in his eyes lends the
impression that he wouldn\@t be above fighting dirty.  Good at what he does,
his hands move quickly as he works, with a scowl on his face.

Most likely a former dockworker, he now serves as a bouncer for the Beast

Emrelna~
Emrelna the waitress slinks through the bar, catching the eye of patrons.
~
Moving silently about the bar picking up empty drinks, this smooth
silvery skinned alatharya known as Emrelna seems to enjoy her job.  A
gorgeous smile at every turn and long slender legs catch the eye as she
slinks around.  Her large brown eyes watch the bar intently, waiting for
work.  Golden blond curls flow halfway down her back and sway as she moves. 
Her tight-fitting uniform is made from polished bjorcha hide, stitched with
black twine.

The aelin merchant Raeneri sits in the center of the store.

Raeneri is a young, enterprising aelin man.  He wears a pair of thin
spectacles on the bridge of his nose, and has his long blonde hair pulled
back in a ponytail that falls between his large grey-feathered wings.  His
thin fingers bear callouses and the signs of years of string-plucking, each
tipped with a rounded-off, well-worn nail.

a heavily tattooed bouncer~
A muscular bouncer leans against the wall, his arms and chest heavily tattooed.
~
Clad in loose pair of leather leggings and an open-chested vest, this
bouncer keeps watch for troublemakers in the bar.  His arms are habitually
crossed over his chest.  Both his arms and chest are muscular and heavily
tattooed.  His body bears countless small scars, as well as a few fresh
scabs and bruises, suggesting that his job is rarely dull.

This well-groomed, brown-furred kankorn reclines upon a couch in the back
of the Merchant\@s Coffer.  Dressed in fine clothes and devoid of any
noticable scarring, only his muscular body gives any hint to his job as a
bouncer.  Seemingly aloof for the most part, he still scans the crowd, alert
for troublemakers.

Gyel-Xan~
Gyel-Xan, leader of the Spawn of Sothmogga, stands here.
~
Gyel-Xan is the leader of the cult of Sothmogga, and foremost among its
Spawn.  Originally one an unborn of the celestial race of the Celanim,
Gyel-Xan, like his fellow spawn, was twisted and corrupted by the coming of
that cosmic horror.  

Gyel-Xan stands about as tall as an alatharya, but his entire body is
covered by ropy, midnight-black tentacles.  An acidic sheen covers his skin,
and only magic prevents the dissolution of his dark silk robes.  Little
trace remains of his Celanimic heritage, save his eyes, which pulse with a
deep blue energy.

a high priest of Sothmogga~
The sinister high priest of Sothmogga stands here.
~
This high priest of Sothmogga was once a human.  About half of his body
is covered with pallid, waxy flesh, which stinks of rotting meat.  The other
half is black, distended tissue, formed into tentacles of many shapes and
sizes.  In particular, his right hand has been completely replaced with a
dexterous, writhing appendage.  Underfoot, drippings of acid fall to the
floor to hiss at his feet.  

The priest wears robes of black silk, which ostensibly cover the infernal
motions of the thing, but in reality only accentuate the presence of
something inhuman beneath them.  Draped about his neck is a gold medallion,
carved into a brazen image of Sothmogga.

A powerfully built demon, the gharku stands enshrined in dense, spined
plates of midnight black chitin.  Thick, plated arms - replete with bony
serrations - hang by the gharku\@s side, ending in massive, black pincers,
capable of snapping a man in half.  The gharku\@s hulking weight rests upon
short, squat legs, each one bent ever so slightly at the joint.  The legs
extend onward into bony, clawed feet.  

A seemingly human skull, wrapped tightly in grey, decaying skin, rests atop
a stick of a neck, protruding only slightly forward from its hulking torso. 
Its jaw is set into a permanent grin, jagged and broken teeth, thrusting
forth from shriveled lips.  Bloodshot eyestalks erupt from the gharku\@s
empty sockets, endlessly swinging about in search of prey.

a chain-draped Nvae\@gra~
(Bound) A gaunt, chain-shrouded figure stalks about.
~
Lengths of blackened and tarnished chain obscure, for the most part, the
gaunt figure of the Nvae\@gra.  Midnight-blue flesh is pulled over an inhuman
skeleton, drawn so tight that spurs of bone edge through.  The chains, links
serrated and cruelly barbed, draped over the demon\@s form give forth an
unsettling clatter as they swing dangerously about, running over and through
the Nvae\@gra\@s flesh, and drag along the ground.  

Beneath the shroud of iron, twin points of glowing red smoulder in the

a Chaigidonian warrior~
(Bound) A demonic warrior of Chaigidon stands here at attention.
~
A tall, muscular demon, this monstrosity is a warrior of the demon city
of Chaigidon.  Overlapping green scales cover the body of the Chaigidonian,
and its face is almost reptilian, which is no doubt evidence of the
ascendancy of the warlord Zyal.  In addition to formidable claws, teeth, and
scales, the demon wears armor of black and crimson plate, and carries a
wickedly barbed sword at its belt.

polytope alien angles~
an alien polytope~
The flickering, obscene angles of an alien polytope are visible here.
~
This thing ..  Is not.  Scarcely organic, the demon is more animate
geometry than any being shaped from flesh and bone.  Its main body is a
many-faced polyhedra, which flexes and pulsates as it rotates through angles
completely beyond the conventional three.  Flickering, disconnected angles
dance about the edges of this alien polytope, their lines jagged and degrees
obscene.  The pattern made by the the thing would be mesmerizing, save for
the brutal fact that to look into this being is to look into madness.

a fleshy construct~
A pale, fleshy construct stands guard here.
~
This construct is a study in the shaping of living tissue into demonic
form.  Made from nude, hairless-pink flesh, the motions of the thing are
rubbery, but supported as if by some unearthly string.  It has something
crudely approximating arms and legs, but both end in stumps of tentacular
bundles.  There is no single head which can be identified on the construct,
but there are several large, nodular mounds which rise off its torso.  No
openings or separate organs are visible which might indicate any sort of
sensory apparatus other than touch.

a clawed Orzub~
(Bound) A clawed Orzub stands here, ready to pounce.
~
Vaguely humanoid in its shape, the Orzub leans forward aggressively upon
its powerful, crouched legs.  Sleek, grey skin is drawn tightly about sinewy
muscles, allowing one to see the heavings of the demon\@s protruding rib
cage.  On either side, long, stick-like arms extend outwards, each one
ending in a razor-sharp, bony sickle that seems to have ripped its way out
from its fleshy cage.  Extending forward from the demon\@s face is a gaping,
canine jaw, lined with a double-layer of smashed, jagged incisors.  Bounding
forward with each step, the Orzub\@s claws seem to whistle through the air
with ominous speed.

(Bound) An armor plated behemoth, a Khil\@Mestahn looms here.
~
A smaller cousin of the foul Khil\@ayum race, the Khil\@Mestahn stands a
mere twelve feet in height.  Thick plates of sickly green chitin cover the
beast, its armored hide fiercely spiked.  A pair of long, plated arms extend
from its body, each ending in a set of claws more reminicent of swords than
fingers.  An impossibly wide maw hangs slightly ajar, displaying rows of
razor teeth, below a set of black, doll-like eyes.  

The Khil-Mestahn plods along slowly, heavily.  The creatures breaths are
audiable- sounding as a huge bellows, each exhalation accompanied by a
dripping of viscous saliva.  The doll-like eyes flicker, and then are calm
once more.

Grey, ropy tentacles entwine about a roughly humanoid form floating in
the air.  The alien figure of the servitor of Isetaton gleams sickly, a fine
sheen of unearthly ichor reflecting the ambient light.  Each of the writhing
members is tipped with a small set of hungrily snapping jaws.  A few odd
tentacles are tipped not with jaws, but with unblinking yellow eyes which
sway with smooth, preternatural grace as they scan their surroundings.

A bulky human, Redrin seems to be perpetually busy.  Once an orphan
himself, he was raised by the staff at the shelter.  Now, he works there as
a sort of handyman, patching walls and fixing furniture as needed.  The
regular exercise required by his duties has granted him an impressive
physique, and though a kindly smile often crosses his face, Redrin seems
quite willing to use his physique in the event of a scuffle.

A pretty young girl browses the bookshelves.
~
A pretty young aelin girl searches amongst the bookshelves for some
desired title, occasionally tapping her chin in thought.  The corners of her
mouth are faintly upturned, hinting at a smile.  Her eyes are of a sparkling
blue, and her skin fair.

a child~
A young child totters around the common room.
~
This small human child plays here quite contentedly, unconcerned with the
grime that covers his face.  Thin locks of dark hair crown his head, tangled
in a disarray.  His pale, thin face bears a broad grin, a stark contrast to
many of the children wandering the streets.

Edigern~
Edigern the Scholar-Smith works on an order here.
~
A stocky human, Edigern works with the confidence of a master craftsman. 
Everything about his demeanor speaks of strength, from the knotted muscles
of his arms to the aura of magical power that seems to emanate from him. 
His blue eyes sparkle intelligently in his broad face, which is capped by an
unruly mess of blonde hair.  His teeth are remarkably white, a stark
contrast to his tanned skin.  His fingers, like the rest of his body, appear
thick and strong.  They move with a grace uncommon to one of such build.

Aerlon the leatherworker~
Aerlon the leatherworker is here, carefully shaping a bit of leather.
~
Surprisingly haggard and worn-looking for one of his race, Aerlon the
leatherworker maintains this shop.  His face and hands have almost taken on
the appearance of leather themselves.  Somewhere in his past Aerlon\@s wings
were broken, for they lay awkwardly folded across his back.  Aerlon\@s face
seems predisposed to frowning, a fact which makes him appear aged.  His
fingers are long and lanky, and move with the agility of a master craftsman.

Psentil the goldsmith works hunched over his bench.

Psentil the goldsmith, an entrepreneur from Ashta Harrud, is a stocky,
short human with dark olive skin.  Musclebound yet possessing a respectable
amount of manual dexterity, this jeweler plies his trade with skill both at
his forge and behind the bargaining counter.  Black hair is cropped short
and neat, as is a small, oiled goatee and moustache.  Bright, attentive
eyes, slightly nearsighted from years at his bench, have a calculating,
evaluatory sparkle to them.  Neat white teeth and immaculate fingernails
emphasize this man\@s attention to appearance, though his hands and forearms
are dotted with shiny weals and burns from decades\@ worth of working with
liquid metals.

Bai\@soco~
Bai\@soco the Master Alchemist stands at the podium here.
~
A frail, aged aelin robed in a white laboratory smock, Bai\@soco\@s short
hair is grizzled and grey.  A long, thin face, scarred by past mishaps,
contains a pair of piercingly bright grey eyes which dart about with a
shrewd, discerning look.  Veined hands still possess an extraordinary
deftness and subtlety, evidenced by his occasional manipulation of the many
pieces of equipment about the laboratory.  

A Master Alchemist, Bai\@soco is the leader of the Var Bandor sect of the
alchemical guild, projected to his current status by his keen sense for
subtleties in both materials and in mortals.  Partially responsible for the
symbiosis between the Council of Scholars and the alchemists despite their
long-standing rivalry, he also spends his time instructing new students in
his own guild.

A tall caladaran stands here, dressed in the robes of an acolyte.
~
A tall, caladaran, oddly muscled for his race, stands his vigil here. 
Dressed in the robes of an acolyte, he has yet to choose his sphere of
study, and watches over the meeting hall of the Council of Scholars to help
him make his decision.  Long, white hair tumbles down his back in a loose
plait, and a small moustache sits on his weathered, bark-like face.  Wide
shoulders and strong hands seem conditioned by some menial labor - perhaps
farming - and his brown skin is tanned far more than would usually befit a
person of scholarly disposition.

a young ch\@taren~
A young ch\@taren, dressed in a simple dushasn robe, stands here.
~
This young wisp of a girl is small and petite, no more than six or seven
years old.  Wrapped in a simple dushasn robe of creamy white homespun, she
seems rather agitated.  Energetic green eyes dart about, and her
translucent, nearly transparent skin seems to shimmer with inner vibrancy. 
Long, bouncy hair of fiery red is bound back in an ornate wooden clasp.

a stately caladaran woman~
A stately caladaran scholar walks through here.
~
A sinewy, earthy looking thread is woven roughly into a long robe which
blankets this woman from her brilliant but gnarled white hair, down to her
heels.  Cinching it tight at her hips, a thick belt of fur and leather is
riddled with pouches and pockets, each bursting with indistinguishable
contents.  Generally preoccupied with her own thoughts, she does not give
the air of one of the merchants embroiled in politics or the mercantile
activities, Crystalline, baby blue eyes shine with an intensity and passion
uncharacteristic of a lady dressed in such a manner, but they seem to befit
her grace and undeniable dignity.

An emaciated aelin lounges here, expression vacant and distant.
~
This aelin man is starvation-thin, pale skin covered with a spiderweb of
blue veins.  His hair is shaved to the scalp, the grizzled stubble
prematurely aged.  His eyes seem to start from their sockets, the cheeks
sunken and hollowed.  A fervent, hungry light smoulders within them, and his
lips are oddly swollen, though chapped and flaking.

An unkempt kankoran wastes away here.

The weathered form of an emaciated kankoran is here, his wolven snout
twitching nervously.  Impossibly thin, his features are sunken and gaunt,
dominated by a pair of unblinking, dull-grey eyes.  In contrast, his paws
are frenetic, seeming ever to move, scratching at his body nervously.  His
once proud coat is mottled and distended, having suffered the ravages of
neglect, the fur worn bare in patches, surrounded by claw-marks.

A plump, middle-aged woman makes alterations to a dress on the counter.

A rounded woman keeps the shop, humming out of tune to herself as she
works.  While her face is unwrinkled, her dark hair is streaked through with
grey, though arranged to hide most of it.  Still, she seems to have little
difficulty going about her business at the shop, keeping things neat and
tidy, and free from the hands of the wandering street urchins.

A wiry, muscular woman lounges on one of the couches, keeping an eye on customers.
~
The woman seems strong and capable, her muscles slim but clearly defined.
Her hair is a dark chestnut brown, cut short in a style that does not
particularly flatter her square face.  Despite her unremarkable appearance,
she watches customers alertly and intently, clearly ready and able to put
down problems at a moment\@s notice.  Though she tends a wineglass in one
hand, she seems to nurse it, only sipping from it but rarely.

Lannette~
An unsavory human woman tends the counter.
~
Lannette is an unsavory looking human woman, and owns the Wench\@s Lute. 
She is short and pudgy, middle-age having caught up to her with sudden
alacrity.  Her face is weathered and her hands are rough, but she carries
herself with odd pride despite it.  A resident of Var Bandor, she saved a
conspicuous amount of money despite her youthful destitution.  After cutting
an undisclosed deal with the flophouse owner nearby, she renovated the
unoccupied building into a discount instrument shop.

brew bodisous bofarin brutal ale spicy amber bb b.b.~
a glass of a spicy, amber ale known as \#B.B.\@s Brutal Brew\#~
A glass of Bodisous Bofarin\@s brutal brew sits here.~
This ale is named after Bodisous Bofarin, a notorious bandit king. 
Originally hailing from the Brintors, Bodisous made a name for himself as an
adventurer and bandit, and is widely known in the city of Var Bandor and its
environs.  Avoiding serious altercations with the law, Bodisous achieved a
certain heroic reputation after stealing a fragment of a mei\@tzec meteor
from the most powerful priest in Yithoul, later leading to the return of the
god Dolgrael to Avendar.  Taking his earnings from his adventures and his
reward from that altercation, he bought and rennovated a tavern on Aragol
Street, christening it the \@Beast and Bandit\@ tavern.  

The ale itself is a potent brew, and equal to the house brew of any tavern
in Var Bandor.

[Scribbled all over these papers are various notes on fire magics and

In...  Morn, it would seem.  A witch of some sort, said to have perfected
consuming powder.  I must get ahold of it...  

...  Remember to pick up some bone and a wand or two to fuel the spell;
already have the arrows and parchment -- the written name goes last anyway. 
Whom should I try this on first?  Kalzar hasn\@t been very attentive lately. 
Must make sure to get a lock of his hair or some other trifle of his.  I
think that goes after the arrows...  Should double-check before trying...  

...  It seems the flickerfyre needs to be targeted similarly, with a written
name at the end.  Which reminds me; Ilinia told me she heard a rumor old

a shal\@kril~
A many-tendriled shal\@kril lies here.~
The shal\@kril is a creature broken and bred by demons and void scholars,
who use its organic nature for defense and offense in combat.  

Normally shaped into a helmet, the shal\@kril often serves a dual purpose. 
As it retains some rudimentary intelligence, some demon warlords are known
to store messages in the superfluous brain matter in the creature, using
them to transfer messages, or in some cases, even sights and sounds to
servitor demons on the field of battle.  

This particular shal\@kril is slightly larger than the norm, and is
presumably a prime specimen of the breed.

folio1~
Most void scholars and even some lay folk have heard tale of demonkind. 
The most common image associated with such tales, legends, or firsthand
experience tells of beasts which are so horribly strong or wickedly alien
that even the least of them are formidable.  

What fewer know is that there are a class of demons which are specifically a
mockery of the spirit world.  These creatures seldom have explicit shape, or
form, but they do have much of the intangible nature one normal sees in
spirits.  Unfortunately, demons such as this seldom possess the benevolent
or at least indifferent natures of the free form spirits of mortals. 
Rather, these are filled with a great hatred and malevolence, often directed
at mortals and even other demons who possess material form.  

Doubtless there are many, perhaps even an infinite number of such demonic
spirits in the Void.  However, there are three broad categories of them of
which we in the dark arts are aware.  
~
E
folio2~
Firstly, there are the \#devouring spirits\#, which seem to thrive in
the presence of the twin excesses of gluttony and starvation.  These spirits
are generally dark and wispy, and filled with insubstantial mouths, each
clamoring or reaching for some sustenance, forever unable to feed
themselves, as they have no form.  

While commonly fond in the torturous mazes of the Void, these spirits are
often called to serve by scholars.  Rather than fighting or serving some
immediate use, however, the wise scholar will keep such a spirit at his
side until he encounters a likely victim.  At the time, he will order the
spirit to actually possess his target!  

Victims afflicted by the mental presence of the spirit will be consumed with
a ravening hunger, and be forced to eat food at a nearly constant rate, or
lapse into the worse sort of behavior.  Documented instances of ghoulish
cannibalism abound, as well as the famous case of Nemlith Caridor, whose was
possessed by his own demon.  Powerless to resist, Nemlith devoured an entire
bowl of poisoned fruit, which he had been in the habit of duping unfortunate
subordinates into eating.  
~
E
folio3~
The second type of vaporous demon-essence is more powerful.  Known only
as the \#tenebral horror\#, this spirit appears as a noxious, yellow mist, in
which dozens of all-too real jaws clatter mindlessly.  

Tenebral horrors are reputed to roam the streets of Logor, lurking in the
alleys and cul-de-saacs of that dread city.  There, they feast on what
smaller demons they can tear the flesh from, as well as the occasional
succulent mortal soul.  

Scholars who can manage to control these demons use their hunger for blood
to good advantage.  When bound, these demons will obligingly engulf
opponents of the scholar, their jaws feasting with abandon.  The wounds left
by the thing tend to fester, being unlike any normal wounds.  Care should be
taken that the scholar who conjures the horror does not become its victim.  
~
E
folio4~
The third, and final type of the immaterial demons known are the
so-called \#unclean spirits\#.  Totally dark and immaterial, the area
surrounding these beings is generally cloaked in swaths of frigid air.  Pale
lights of lifeless blue shine from the depths of the demon, but these seem
primarily designed to intimidate, as they can sense living things in most
any environment.  

Little is known of the origins of this demon, but it has been conclusively
proven that powerful magic-using demon lords have been sighted with them in
attendance, or used by them as a herald for speaking through possessed
mortals.  Curiously, these defiled spirits were prominent in the court of
Xiganath, who was served by Nyogthua, one of the twin lords of demonic
magic.  One hypothesis accepted by many scholars is that the unclean spirits
are actually created from the souls of mortals, but in a crude, brutal
fashion, that copies the structure of the soul into a demonic matrix.  

The most powerful archmages can bind and control the unclean, forcing them
to serve at their side.  Like the devouring spirit, the unclean can be
ordered to possess enemies of the void scholar, assuming a partial command
of their body!  Those afflicted with the presence of an unclean spirit often
take up a similar demeanor and behavior, unwittingly becoming more like
their demonic master.  Holy ground becomes anathema to them, as does the
practitioners of various forms of positive energy.  Most alarmingly for the
victim of such an infiltration, the presence of a being of negative energy
within their minds leaves them vulnerable to command by practitioners of the
void.  

The tale is told of a minor king in the Rirro Jagka, who was afflicted in
secret by such a demon.  The cunning void scholar who used the spirit
ordered the king to appear in public, and admit that he had been dabbling in
the void.  Such was the public outcry that the spirit scholars were brought
in to test the king, who promptly went mad and attempted to murder them. 
Deposed and exiled, it was revealed that having no heirs, he had left the
kingdom to the void scholar.  And, by the time the demon had left the king,
he was living like an animal in the wilderness, and was promptly stoned when
he returned to his city.

tome~
\\\#The Knowing of Selb-Kar\# is the title of this volume of demonological
lore.  

Unfortunately, as is most often the case, the bulk of the tome is actually
the mad ravings of its author, who consistently refers to himself in the
third person, by the rather regal title of \#The Grand Hierophant of
Geometry\#.  

One particularly lucid passage describes a location in the Void known as
\#Selb-Kar\#.  It is unclear whether Selb-Kar is a city, a geographical
feature, or some sort of unholy temple.  

One fairly lucid passage describes a trip the author made to Selb-Kar, and
things he witnessed there:

\#Tall spires of angles more obscene than acute shadowed me.  Vershaks
shrieked catcalls above.  There was no light until I saw the Intersection. 
A host, no, a floating, flickering, SENATE of shape met at the Intersection.
Dark, alien polytopes, led sonorous fugues, speaking things that no thing
ought not, for they were no thing.  They turned, and I looked at them, but
they LOOKED BACK.  They CHANGED me, and now I SEE.  

MY SOUL HAS A SHAPE NOW\#

The rest of the book is far less coherent.  Towards the end, the author
promises to reveal the arcane \#Angles of Selb-Kar\# which can be used to
summon denizens from that place.  True to his word, the last page is
inscribed with a complicated and obscure collection of runes, lines, and
angles, denoting the mystical symbol referred to be studied by the skilled
scholar.  
~
E
symbolvision~
This collection of geometric figures is an unsettling array of vertices
and lines, each forming a disturbing angle.  Dark runes dot the corners of
the inscription, whose connected lines give it an unsettling impression of
depth.  Appearing to jut out into space, it seems more an artifact of some
alien geometry than a simple two dimensional inscription.  

As you plumb the depths of the image, you find yourself increasingly unable
to look away, until you find yourself somewhere vastly different....  



You travel through a place of unnatural angles, filled with spires and
troughs which quiver due to the force of their own sickly geometry.  

Your path twists and winds, at times looping over and behind itself,
twirling into a helix then following the border of some unimaginable shape. 
No clear direction describes your wandering, but as you travel, you are
struck by the impression that you are being followed.  

In the corners, living angles scuttle in the shadows.  Sharp, ominous
frames, they flicker just out of sight, threatening your progress. 
Overhead, a lean black shape cries out with shrill hatred, and the angles
draw closer.  

Your panicked flight brings you to a local minima in the fabric of this
space, and before you is a host of disturbing shapes.  Each of them appears
to be a polyhedra, warped and twisted into dimensions far beyond the ken of
normal mortals.  They float with intelligence, communicating in dark,
sonorous fugues.  They turn to you, and, shatteringly, you find that you can
almost understand them.  Like mad geometers, they exchange theorems about
the horrors of their space, twisting natural law to their will.  

Listening and witnessing what you have, all faith or confidence in the world
as you know it slips away.  Horrified, you race toward a discontinuity in
the path, and hurl yourself over the edge, hoping to escape.  The sounds of
the alien polytopes follows you into the abyss, and reveals dark secrets all
the way to an infinity of darkness.....  



When your vision clears, you fear for your sanity.  The angles of that place
have been burned into your being, but your confidence in the nature of the
physical world has been shattered.

A shiny violin and bow lie here.~
This violin is made from polished maple wood, and despite its attractive
appearance, is far from perfect; the construction process leaves it prone to
falling out of tune.  Contrarily, it is especially light and thus well
suited to traveling.  The inscription on the bottom of the tailpiece marks
it as a product of Raeneri\@s instrument shop.

The Traits of Drakes
  
The elemental-born drake may exhibit well-studied traits to greater or 
lesser degree, according to kind and age. In most but not all cases, the
older the drake, the more likely it is to demonstrate its traits, and to 
have those traits be more effective. Scholars of the Wakened Stone have
enumerated many, if not all of these traits.

A drake may...
  
  * rush at the foe to bash him or her down to the ground
  * be more vicious against a more wounded foe
  * manifest as inherently of greater level of might and power
  * join with its master in melding through stone
  * loyally seek out its master if separated
  * be healed of wounds when in the deeps
  * be commanded to rush against a foe at some distance, as does a templar
  * have some ability to dodge some of the blows made against it
  * call upon itself the diamond protective enchantment
  * generally attack with more frequency in battle
  * attack more often as it grows more injured
  * attempt to blast its opponents with sand
  * bite a foe so as to leave bleeding wounds
  * with stonestong become more deadly and resistant
  * become difficult target with spells harmful or beneficial

Dragonkind\@s Elemental Nature

A wide variety of reptilian creatures inhabit the prime plane.  These
mundane creatures, such as the varied snakes, lizards, alligators (and dare
we add, even the srryn), are not inherently magical creatures.  However, it
is suspected by some scholars, including myself, that their very far-distant
ancestors may not have been native to the prime, and that the first
reptilian species was introduced through magic.  They are theorized to be
distant and diluted offspring of elemental kin.  

It is a controversial idea, to be sure, to link our common lizards with the
elementals*.  But one can begin to see the foundations for such a theory
when considering dragonkind--the mighty dragons, and their lesser kin the
drakes.  These are magical beings with clear affinities to the elemental
planes.  Naturalists have affirmed that such creatures are not as other
animals of Avendar.  Thus, who is to say that these elemental affinities do
not extend even to origins, and that dragonkind are native to the elemental
planes themselves?  

It is clear that dragonkind is much more vicious and fierce than more common
elemental beings a scholar might summon.  But it is also known that a wide
variety of elemental beings inhabit the planes.  And so I contend that
dragons and drakes are in truth elementals, or a manifest form of such which
appear in the prime plane as large powerful reptilian beasts.  



* There are some who express the viewpoint (such as Tarfein of Gilfarin and
his supporters) that certain facts do not align with the Elemental Nature of
Dragonkind theory.  However, many researchers have been, if you\@ll pardon
the expression, \#consumed\# by the subject.  And so the body of research is
rather regrettably filled with holes and remains a topic most scholars are
unwilling to examine firsthand.  
~
E
plates3~
Presence in Avendar

At times rifts, natural or created through powerful magic, may open pathways
between the planes.  Elemental beings may wander through of their own
accord, drawn by an affinity with an aligned location of the prime.  
  
They may also be summoned by arcane means, connecting with and harnessing a
portion of the elemental essence (or \@animus\@, as some say) to the prime. 
It is apparent that those elemental creatures who resonate with order
(chiefly earth, but also void and water) are more likely to heed a summoning
and be controlled via magic.  
  
As elementals of earth are said to be the among those most easily drawn or
summoned to Avendar, with spells that any serious student of earth will 
soon master, this lends credence to the Elemental Nature theory.  For we
have long observed a predominance of earth dragons (manifesting as metallic
or gem-like), and a predominance of earth drakes (stone-like or gem-like). 
Thus it is the earth dragons and drakes that have been most observed,
studied, and mythologized in lore, many being drawn to chasms and caverns,
rare metals and minerals aligned with their affinities within the plane of
earth.  
  
Void dragons and drakes are also known to dwell in Avendar, but also drawn
by affinity to places of deepest shadow touched of void, while the water
dragons and drakes, which are likely to be mistaken for sea-serpents*,
naturally find a place in the greatest deeps within the oceans of Avendar. 
These creatures also represent connections to planes resonant with order.  



* When I was still just a senior mage, I hosted a series of debates with a
then-master of the Water Guild, Shavindska (who would later gain some renown
as The Staff of the Green Fountains) on whether leviathans were in fact
ancient water dragons. While we both agreed the creatures originate from the
plane of water, the discussion ended when none of our assistants returned from
a research expedition.
~
E
plates4~
Non-Ordered Dragonkind 

There are also legends, not well verified, of dragons and drakes of non-
ordered elements found near the border areas of the planes.  Shuddeni
scholars have claimed to witness flame dragons and lava drakes within the
depths of volcanoes, and air scholars have spoken of thunder dragons and
zephyr drakes within the eyes of the mightiest storms.  The ch\@taren, too,
have their ancestral tales of analogous creatures of the spirit planes, the
Iwminar and Ahiaa, though such tales are told in sorrow, and they relate
that many if not all of the Iwminar were believed to be corrupted or
consumed in the Great Devastation of Spirit.  

Such creatures remain far less studied, and many leading scholars consider 
them pure legend without basis in reality.  This is understandable, in light
of the Elemental Nature theory, given that scholars of non-ordered elemental
spheres can summon and control even the common elementals only with great 
difficulty and cost, if at all (and then, they are more likely to find 
success when cross-studying an ordered sphere, as with the summoners of 
lava and fog elementals).
~
E
plates5~
The Traits of Dragons
                             
The most fearsome and infamous weapon of a dragon, which it can only
wield once it has matured beyond its adolescence, is to channel a raw blast
of elemental fury at its victim.  The \#dragon breath\# is connected in
obvious form to the creature\@s affinities within its plane of origin,
another fact that supports the Elemental Nature theory; flames from fire,
frost from water, toxic vapours from void, so forth.  

The breath is known to be weakened as the creature is physically weakened,
which strongly suggests the body\@s role as an important element of the 
conduit to the plane. For an elder dragon in full strength and might, the 
destructive power of the blast is unparalleled.

The dragons are known as well to delight in the proximity of the rare earth
minerals and metals. This is why older dragons are likely to be found with
caches of treasure, coins and gems. This has brought about the tales and
legends of the great Greed of the Dragons, which is of course utter 
nonsense, for they see no monetary value and would indeed much rather eat
a merchant and her goods than purchase finery in the markets. Yet cities 
have been laid low for nothing more than a chest of copper coins, and so we 
shall forgive the commoners their misunderstanding.
~
E
plates7~
On Dragonkind in the Wild

It is unheard of for dragons, though to our knowledge gendered*, to 
establish a mating pair and breed in the prime. Scholars speculate that 
dragon eggs would not develop or hatch away from the forces of its 
elemental home. 

Unlike dragons, drakes have been known to establish breeding colonies. 
This is related, it is theorized, to the fact that earth scholars have 
learned the secrets of drawing forth nascent elemental drakes from their
plane into the prime. These hatchling drakes are trained to do the scholar\@s
bidding, but also acclimate to the prime as they mature, eventually maturing
into a creature as much of this plane as of the elements. I believe they, at
some point, may even lose their link to the their animus and survive--still 
dangerous, still a being of some magical influence, but now wholly of 
Avendar.
   
   
* See Tziniptja\@s \#Dragon Eggs and Drake Stones\# for more information (though
compiled by scribes after the scholar\@s unfortunate death, it remains 
nonetheless the authoritative work on the topic).
~
E
plates8~
Wakening and Maturation

If there have been dragons summoned or wakened by mortal casters, they have
never been successfully controlled. But of earth drakes, the Wakened Stone 
tradition of scholars has preserved the knowledge of their summoning. And 
this is perhaps the greatest support to the Elemental Nature theory, for 
earth drakes are wakened from within a common elemental!

I contend that the drake and elemental are not the same being, but rather
the elemental\@s conduit to its plane is used--perhaps even consumed--by the
drake as the stone around the elemental is wakened. The surrounding stone of 
the spell location will greatly affect the nature of the drake, of course--
its particular qualities, its overall might, and its rate of growth. Others
theorize that the creature is the same being in animus, simply reshaped by
an infusion of the stone of the prime.

The rate of growth is a significant matter.  Maturation is the greatest 
factor of power for all dragonkind. Even a young dragon can lay waste to 
entire kingdoms if it so desires, but fortunately as most dragons that take
up residence in the prime are resonant with ordered element, they rarely if 
ever pursue destruction for its own sake.

Where the most ancient of drakes is a creature of might and danger, the 
ancient dragons have the strength and power of demi-gods. It is for this
reason that the dragon is held as such a potent symbol of fear and 
destruction throughout the land.

On the Character of the Planar Beings of Earth:

As is well known, the scholars of earth have used
servants from that elemental plane since the 
dawning of their art. According to myth, elementals
were even used in the construction of parts of the old 
city, helping to build the city\@s walls when labor grew
scarce.

Little has been written about the nature of the common
elemental, however, and I have written this text to 
make a general study of the subject. 

Now, unlike those who dabble in the void, we do not 
call our elemental servants unwillingly into the 
prime material, nor do we threaten or bribe them. 
Rather, most elementals of earth actually crave the 
unfamiliar taste of matter in the prime material, and 
enjoy helping scholars create new structures of
matter, or rearrange existing structures.

This taste for exotic matter is possible because 
elementals as such do not transfer their physical 
matter from the plane of earth -- to do so would require
opening a stable gateway to that plane, which would 
require far more concentration and mana expenditure.

Rather, when an elemental is summoned, the animus, 
or animating spirit of an elemental is conjured, and 
they inhabit a shell of matter in the prime material. Of
course, the power and versatility of the spirit called 
will depend on the proximity of the caster to the plane
of earth. It is well known that elementals within
caves or fissures have greater strength, resulting in 
this property.


The rest of the text concerns technical matters, 
including various tests of hardness and magical 
strength.

Less studied are these last, for to find and wake them is rare:

The Amethyst Drake
 - it is said to dodge blows and resist the touch of void
 - yet it is quick to fall against holy wrath
  
The Ruby Drake
 - it is said to be hardened to fire but harmed by cold
 - its deadliness grows at the sight of weakened prey
   
The Emerald Drake
 - it is said that no weakness taints it and spells are slow to find it
 - somewhat loyal, and somewhat resisting the arcane and mundane blow
  
The Diamond Drake
 - it is said to be slow-ageing but sturdy, standing against mundane blows
 - it knows loyalty and it may call upon itself a diamond warding

The Sapphire Drake
 - it is said that it embraces cold but shuns the flame
 - it is known to be the most loyal to a master of all drake-kind

The common room of the Var Bandor Children\@s Shelter is a large
rectangular chamber, paneled with planks of stained oak.  Small tables are
scattered at the back of the room, beside what looks to be a kitchen.  The
redolence of freshly baked bread mingles with the smell of beeswax and the
smoky aroma of the large fire burning in a stone fireplace.  Towards the
front of the room, a large rug pattered with blue and yellow designs is
spread on the floor, littered with countless toys and drawing utensils.  A
large oaken desk has been set beside the door, covered with sketches that
clearly are the work of a child\@s hand.  In the northeast corner of the room
a simple wooden staircase leads up, and an arched doorway is set into the
west wall.

Several bookcases of pine rest against the west and north walls of this

Edigern\@s Custom Armor and Weapons~
Unlike most of the shops lining Iron Street, this location seems clean,
almost sparkling.  A rectangular marble counter dominates the center of the
room, apparently functioning as both a working space and a table for serving
clientele.  The floor is composed of a white stone, as are the walls and
ceiling.  Though mostly unadorned, the walls do sport a poster of some kind.
A small glowing ball suspended on a golden chain overhead provides most of
the illumination for this smithy, though several smaller lamps are evident
in the work area.  A variety of tools of both mundane and magical nature
hang from pegs in the wall.

The Forge of the Golden Sands~
This cramped, low room is thick with a smoky haze, the dry, warm air
heavy with the acrid smells of the forge.  A large, cluttered workbench
fills one corner entirely, covered with scraps of metal and a jumble of
tools.  In another corner, a round forge made from bricks of shaped clay
glows brightly, the orange-red light pouring through the small, grilled
opening.  A low counter divides the room from north to south, and several
low cushions of rich fabric have been set out for customers to wait upon. 
The low roofbeams of aged wood are charred slightly in a few places, but
otherwise the shop is quite well-kept.  A floor of magically smooth stone is
clean and neat, but for accumulated splashes of spilled metal near the
forge.  A rich tapestry hangs on the east wall, beside a luxurious, gilded
door.  The room is lit by several glowing orbs above the workbench, tempered
with the fiery light of the forge.  

A slate sign rests upon the counter.

work bench workbench tools~
This sturdy workbench has been made from the same, smooth stone as the
floor, joining seamlessly with both the floor and the clay walls.  Obviously
magically made, the nondescript stone is speckled with gleaming splashes of
various precious metals.  Several small tools, used in the forging and
shaping of metal, are scattered and piled about the bench among bits of
twisted, half-metled ingots, molds, protective gloves, and several small
bins of dirty water for cooling and tempering.  
~
E
round brick bricks forge clay~
This round forge, made from shaped clay bricks, fills the southwestern
corner of the long room.  Supplied by a large leather bellows attached to a
series of pipes and a brimming hopper of coal on the far side, the forge
glows dully.  A small hearth under the grilled grating allows for coal to be
raked out for a cooler work surface, and stone shelves inside hold crucibles
and other tools integral to the forging of jewelry.  
~
E
rich tapestry~
This heavy woven tapestry is made from cotton yarns of the finest
quality, the pliant, supple fibers dyed a spectrum of vibrant colors. 
Primarily done in strong reds and golds, the tapestry depicts a sprawling
desert city with winding streets and a central fortress raised up on some
sort of half-ziggurat.  A tower stretches up above the city, clearly
exaggerated.  From this tower hang a set of merchant\@s scales, gleaming with
skeins of actual metal, woven in.

A Dimly-Lit Lounge~
The lower level of the Rare Nefortu is an expansive basement which has
been converted into a comfortable lounge.  The floor is covered by a plush,
dark carpet, and the room is arrayed with low coffee tables and leather
couches.  The dark cherry motif of the upper level is shared here as well,
with lower lighting and additional polish.  The air is thick with the scents
of wine and smoke, giving the lounge an even moodier cast.  The entire
ceiling is mirrored, catching all of the muted colors below and granting the
room additional perceived size.  A stairwell on the west wall leads back up
to the store proper.

A Pristine Antechamber~
This cool stone antechamber is bereft of nearly all ornamentation.  The
blank stone walls and floor of the octagonal room are spotless, the pale
grey of the soft rock kept immaculately clean.  Benches of the same stone
are built against the base of the walls, allowing visitors space to sit.  A
vaulted ceiling ascends in tiered steppes upwards to a keystone of crystal,
in which is embedded a gleaming symbol of the Alchemical Eye.  An open
doorway leads out to the black stones of Arcanos Street to the east, and an
identical archway leads into another octagonal room to the west.

horizontal oval with pointed ends.  A round circle gleams within, lined with
gold, and nine short lines, also inlaid, represent nine lashes about the
perimeter.

An Octagonal Waiting-Room~
This air of this stone chamber is laden with a variety of smells,
metallic and harsh.  The blank stone walls and floor of the octagonal room
are spotless, the pale grey of the soft rock kept immaculately clean. 
Benches of the same stone are built against the base of the walls, allowing
visitors space to sit.  An open archway leads north to an octagonal
stairwell, and another leads into a chamber to the east.  Six symbols adorn
the six walls of the chamber not occupied by exits, and three symbols are
blazoned on the ceiling.  An angled, octagonal stair descends from the
ceiling here, assembled from black cast-iron.

This gleaming sunburst symbol is the universal sign of the Light and
spirit-magics.  Hammered from thin silver, the metal has been imbued with
sparkling spirit-lights.  
~
E
fire~
A glowing strip of pure gold, inset with large rubies, has been melted
and poured into an amorphous symbol of a blazing flame.  A faint reddish
glow and a slight, yet noticeable, warmth emanate from the metal.  
~
E
water~
This bluish steel spear, bound in azure silk, is mounted on the wall. 
The head, carved from a leaf-shaped shard of sapphire, gleams softly with
water-magics.  The symbol of Jolinn emits a faint chill, a continual wisp of
chill fog flowing off the spearhead.  
~
E
air~
This flattened cone of spun wire is made from an odd blend of metals. 
Copper and steel seem prevalent, the flattened cone warped and twisted like
a cyclone or a storm funnel.  The metal sparks with magical energy, sizzling
and snapping quietly.  
~
E
void~
The stylized Tooth of Ashur has been forged from pitch-black iron,
sinuous curves of the symbolic fang mounted directly into the stone.  A
faint aura of negativity surrounds the metal, a chill felt more by the soul
than the body.  
~
E
earth~
This symbol of earth is a large crystal, each sharp facet outlined in
brownish, delicate traceries of some unknown metal.  The crystalline lattice
is somehow more ..  \@fixed\@ than the rest of the room, a sense of inherent
stability surrounding the large gem.  
~
E
six symbols symbol wall walls three ceiling~
Six symbols, each representing one of the magical spheres of Avendar, are
emblazoned directly into the six walls of the chamber.  Spirit, water, air,
fire, void, and earth are present, each shown without bias or precedence
over any of the others.  

In the ceiling, three more symbols can be seen.  Each is positioned to sit
between two of the six, should they be placed level with each other.  The
three symbols of ancient power, nature, and transmogrification, combined
with the six spheres of magic, complete the Alchemical Nine, the nine
categories into which the alchemists divide and classify the substances of
this plane.  
~
E
ancient power~
This symbol depicts a stylized pyramid, etched into the ceiling. 
Highlighted with black enamel, the pyramid seems to be a rendition of one of
the temples of the ancient alatharya before their cataclysmic Sundering by
the gods.  Beings of great wisdom and power, this symbol is a small tribute
to their former greatness, as well as a reminder of the dangers of hubris.  
~
E
nature~
This symbol of nature is formed in the shape of a three-part flower.  One
petal, formed from bronze, is a clawed, slashing set of talons.  The second,
carved from volcanic glass, mimics the jagged peaks of a stark, bare
mountain.  The third, shaped from rich rowan-wood, is delicately carved into
an impossibly delicate tree, complete with tiny individual leaves and
branches.  The whole symbol seems to hum of its own volition, vibrating with
life-energies.  
~
E
transmogrify transmogrification~
This symbol, depicting the alchemical property of transmogrification, is
a simple circle of a shining, greasy metal, possibly quicksilver. 
Shimmering and quivering, the round symbol seems inconstant beneath your
gaze, mercurial and changing even though its properties undergo no visible
transformation.

The Meeting Chamber for the Council of Scholars~
This high ceilinged chamber is opulently decorated, a mosaic of
semiprecious stones in the floor forming the simple crest of the Council of
Var Bandor Scholars.  Tall windows stretch from floor to ceiling, all around
the walls of the oval room.  Gilded faux pillars line the walls between each
window.  A ceiling of pressed plaster is painted in bright colors, from
which hang two ornate chandeliers.  The gleaming brass and crystal fixtures
light the room with tall beeswax tapers.  The walls are painted a rich
orange-red, and a long table of wood, polished to a glowing sheen, dominates
the eastern end of the room.  A cast-iron stairwell curves its way down to
the floor below, and the room continues to the east.

This crest is displayed on a background of pale topaz within a circle of

sections.  Each a different color, they are made from yellow citrine, red
garnets, pale blue moonstone, milky alabaster, dark tiger\@s-eye, and
gleaming black obsidian.  A greenish quill is displayed rampant on the
hexagon, formed of turquoise.  A ring of ivy is displayed in emerald about

north~
This window looks down over the pyramidical roof of a scholar\@s home. 
Looking through the glass, you can see, from this angle, a dusty room filled
with several cloth-covered pieces of furniture.  Further to the northwest,
the circular tower of Water and Spirit rises above the other rooftops, the
graceful lines and gilded window-frames making it quite visible from most of
the city.  Directly northwards, the squat, square walls of the void and fire
guild stand menacingly.  
~
E
west~
The window has an uninhibited view of the commercial district, the
black-stoned Ilrin street a short distance over the rooftops to the west.  
~
E
south~
A jumble of domed and flat rooftops stretch to the south and west, broken
by the bulky, ramparted tower of Earth and Air.

E
gilded faux pillars~
These simple pillars, half-embedded in the wall, are made from shaped
plaster and painted thickly with gold leaf.  Designed to draw the eye

A Smoky Stairwell~
Wisps of smoke curl up from countless sconces below.  Set into the thick
stone walls, the torches in these sconces illume a downward-spiralling stone
staircase, which leads into darkness below.  The air is somewhat musty here,
a smell not entirely obscured by the hazy smoke.  The southern archway leads
out into a fresher atmosphere.  A single cast-iron brazier squats at the top
of the stairs, its flickering light helping the torches to brighten the
place.

A Dank Stairwell~
The air at the bottom of the stairwell is dank and musty, and the
atmosphere a bit stifled, an effect magnified by the relatively cramped
space.  Dusky sconces hang on the stone walls, spiralling up in the same
fashion as the heavy stone staircase which helixes its way up and out of
sight.  A small wooden door has been jammed open in the east wall, and a
sturdy stone archway leads south.  Small drafts of alternately warm and cool
air drift in through this archway, providing the only alleviation to the
heaviness of the air.

A Cramped Reagent Storeroom~
This small closetlike room is narrow and cramped, shelves pressing in on

A Messy Laboratory~
This octagonal room is roughly twenty feet in diameter, the walls lined
with high counters.  Several counters also stand independently in the middle
of the room, allowing several people to work simultaneously with access to
sufficient workspace.  A wide chandelier, laden with wax candles, illumines
the room, aided by the inconstant, multicolored light of the countless
retorts and beakers scattered about.  Systems of glass tubes, jars, and
flasks cover the counters, each containing a different substance or
specimen.  The room seems to be filled with innumerable experiments run by
different alchemists, in different stages of completion or care.  A harsh,
acrid stink fills the air, which is alternately cool and warm.  A stone
archway leads north, and another archway leads east.

A multitude of glass tubes, flasks, beakers, and other research
paraphenalia in varying stages of cleanliness sprawls across the counters,
so jumbled that it is rather impossible to tell where one workspace ends and
another begins.  Sets of balance scales, stirrers, measurers, burners,
lenses, and scraps and reams of paper are strewn among the gleaming glass
assemblages.  All manner of liquids, solids, and gasses can be seen within
the assortment of containers - colors and smells of every type imaginable
lurk throughout the boiling, condensing, dripping, stirring, freezing
apparati.

A Small Lecture Hall~
This small, octagonal stone chamber is built around a small raised dais
in the back of the room, upon which stands a simple podium.  The wall behind
the lectern is made from soft grey slate, many half-erased marks and smears
showing it is oft-used as a chalkboard.  No chairs or other seating
furniture mar the empty floor.  Bright torches light the room, mounted in
iron sconces on the walls.  The ceiling, made from smooth poured plaster,
arches slightly upwards, biasing the room\@s acoustics to accentuate any
speakers\@ voice.  An open archway leads west into an open laboratory.  The
air is cool in this room, laden with a sharp, metallic tang of energy.

The Apothecary\@s Cabinet~
This low room is painted a serene shade of turquoise, the heavy roofbeams
made from dark, stained wood.  A tall counter of Nendorin oak dominates this
space, restricting access to the back two-thirds of the room.  Set into the
middle of the counter is a pale stone disc, about three feet across, etched
to resemble an eye.  The pupil and outer edge of the eye emit a dim glow.  A
silver plaque hangs at the end of the counter.  Behind the counter, the
walls are lined with wooden racks that stretch from floor to ceiling. 
Within the racks hang endless rows of wands, staves and glass vials of every
imaginable hue.  Tiny motes of energy, spread throughout the racks, cause
the vials to glow brightly and bathe the room in a sea of multi-colored
light.  A narrow archway framed in the eastern wall leads out.  A heavy,
velvet curtain blocks out all light coming from the adjoining room, though a
hint of roasted meat seeps through, blending with the acrid odors that hang
heavily in this room.

A Decrepit, Boarded-Up House~
This house may have once been somewhat opulent, the plasterwork - now
swollen with damp, cracked, and furred with mold - seems to have been
elaborate, and perhaps painted with gold at one time.  The floor is the only
solid piece of the structure, the discolored, stained boards still
stubbornly holding strong.  The western wall has a decided list to it,
dipping inwards dangerously in the middle.  A stair leading to an upper
story has long collapsed, the shaft upwards filled with the caved-in remains
of the stairwell wall and the stairs themselves lying shattered on the floor
in a mass of splinters and rust.  Two large windows to the south have been
boarded up.  The air is musty and stinks of urine and damp.  No furniture is
in the room, having been long carried-off or used as firewood.  A small
threadbare carpet, incongruously clean, sits in the empty northeastern
corner.  A drunken, sagging doorway leads out to the street to the south,
the door itself lying flat on its face on the floor.

Though actually quite large, this room is so packed with opulent
furniture and tapestries that it appears almost cramped.  The floor is
covered in a luxuriant Harrudim carpet hand-crafted to match the tapestries
and hangings on the walls.  At the center of the room is a plush sofa,
upholstered in a floral pattern, next to a low credenza of dark, exotic
wood.  A crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling, sparkling in the light
of a dozen candles.  Small doors along the far wall lead deeper into the

Inside the Northern Gatehouse~
This gatehouse house is built behind the gates of Sadrent, the oldest of
the gates into Var Bandor.  Outside, to the north, a ferry leads across the
Dantaron river, while to the south Sadrent road snakes its way into the
city.  The gatehouse is ill-tended, leading in to the poorest section of the
city, and consequently little attention is paid to the traffic of riff-raff
and n\@er-do-wells through these wrought iron gates.

pulleys that operates the gate is housed.  You see there the lever which can

between the cracks of the bricks.  Cobblestones once lined this street, but

uneven travel.  An ancient, crumbling house is to the west, and the alley

Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way

front boarded up.  A doorway leads into the dark first floor.

A Ruined House~
A large pile of rubble shifts below your feet, the footing slippery but
manageable.  Blackened wood and brick chunks point in all directions from
the pile, sharp edges and rough surfaces creating a possible hazard.  A
broken crib lies set apart from the rest of the rubble, the rocker on one
side askew from the rest.

Dretch Street~
The crowded, filthy streets press in on you...  Too many of the people
walking by look as if they could use a little extra money, and they\@re
eyeing you as a prospective donor.  The few who aren\@t looking at you
sullenly drag their feet from place to place slowly making their unhasseled
way through the dingy avenue.  A few piles of rubble indicate collapsed
buildings, and forgotten livelihoods.

A Cramped, Smoky Shop~
This small room was likely built as a storage shed or large pantry; now,
a small mercantile establishment has wedged itself awkwardly in the
inadequate space.  Shelves crowd in on either side, and a heavy wooden table
has been clearly sawn in half to fit in its place as the main counter. 
Empty casks and bundles of drying tobacco hang in rough fishing nets from
the low ceiling.  A pair of guttering carriage lanterns provide poor light. 
East, a heavy wooden door leads out to a narrow alley.

A Ruined Dwelling~
This place is an absolute wreck: no one could possibly live here.  A
large, gaping hole in the roof sheds light into the room, in addition to the
window with only one shutter on the eastern wall.  While pieces of it are
everywhere, a large mass of hay is somewhat constrained to a corner of the
room, with a sweat-stained blanket thrown haphazardly on top of it.  Some
cracked crockery has been ground into the floor near the door, although a
few pieces are still whole.

Sald Street is a narrow, winding avenue that closely resembles a

A Squalid House~
This one-room house seems lived in, despite its advanced state of
disrepair.  The dirt floor has been recently swept, and some straw in the
corner shows signs of recent habitation.  Some ashes in the middle of the
room and soot on the ceiling indicate the presence of a recent fire, but no
signs of whatever was used for fuel are here.  Otherwise, the room seems
quite barren.

A Squalid House~
This one-room house is in a severe state of disrepair.  The lone exit to

neither pane nor shutter to keep out the elements.  An iron stove squats in
the corner, split down the middle , weakened by long use.  The room contains
little else - the rotting walls and creaking floorboards testament to its

A Ruined House~
This ancient house has been abandoned by its rightful owners and left to

from the walls, and holes in the floor are prevalent.  Trash litters the
floor.  The ashes of a long-ago fire are in one corner, explaining the char

An Abandoned House~
An abandoned house located in the worst neighborhood of Var Bandor, this
filthy building is filled with trash and broken pieces of lumber.  The
broken walls are full of holes, and dirt is everwhere.  A pile of foul rags
is in the corner, apparently being used as a rat\@s nest, and a stack of
boards has been used to fuel a campfire in the corner.  The entire wall is
stained by smoke, and the lower boards are burned away.  The loose
floorboards creak and shift beneath your feet.

Long, hollow metal rods lie before two large furnaces.  Although hot, the
glass-blower\@s shop doesn\@t reach near the tempuratures of the other things
on Iron Street.  They sit prettily, glittering in all various shapes,
colours and sizes.  Although the work isn\@t too terribly wonderful.  It is
quite nice for such a city.

A House~
You are inside the home of what would appear to be one of the typical
families found along Iron Street.  The house itself is rather small,
although it appears to be fairly sturdy in its construction.  Inside, there
is relatively little furniture, and what is present looks as though its
quite old.

A Dilapidated House~
A musty smell pervades this entire living space.  Bedding, in the form of
blankets and straw, line almost every wall of the house making room for at
least ten occupants.  Cracks between boards along the windows give little
protection from the wind as it whips up small dust-devils which scurry about
the room.  Iron street and its dubious foundry, which has given the entire
road a look of weariness, lies to the south.

Abandoned House~
This house seems to have been lived in rather recently, but the tenants
have since moved on in their existences.  A few, ragged blankets still line
the northern wall, however, judging from the droppings left behind, they got
their most recent use from some sort of rodent.  You can exit the house to
the south by squeezing through some loosely hung boards.

This shop is a bit better kept than the others in the area.  There are no
really glaring problems, just a few minor ones, yet the shop still has an
aged look.  Shelves line the walls, filled with simple tools, and small
weaponry.  The few daggers he carries are formidably worked, but not
elegant.  Some small pieces of armor are on the shelves, slightly dented.

A Dilapidated Shanty~
Dirt is the most prominent feature of this broken-down home.  Dust is
caked on top of the cabinets, whose doors swing from one hinge.  A table is
scored with cuts from hundreds of knife strokes, and bread crumbs are
scattered about it.  One chair in the corner is missing a leg, and leans
against the wall.  The roof has been patched numerous times, but
strategically located buckets sit in various places on the floor.

This place is an absolute wreck: noone could possibly live here.  A
large, gaping hole in the roof sheds light into the room, in addition to the
window with only one shutter on the eastern wall.  While pieces of it are
everywhere, a large mass of hay is somewhat constrained to a corner of the
room, with a sweat-stained blanket thrown haphazardly on top of it.  Some
cracked crockery has been ground into the floor near the door, although a
few pieces are still whole.

Sald Street~
Sald Street is a narrow, winding avenue that closely resembles a
forgotten alley.  The broken cobblestones are damp with rainwater,
indicating a malfunctioning drainage system.  The houses in this
neighborhood are wretched, torn-apart things, filthy and barely habitable. 
To the north is Dretch Street, and Sald Street leads south.

A Board-covered House~
Bare wooden planks completely cover the walls and ceiling of this house:
once used as patches, they have now become the structure.  A pile of filthy
clothes is in one corner, large, jagged holes are chewed through the cloth
and the stench is terrible.  Mold covers some of the boards: it\@s amazing
this house is still intact.

A Run-Down House~
This ancient house has been abandoned by its rightful owners and left to
the hands of Dretch Street\@s vagrants and ruffians.  Boards have been torn
from the walls, and holes in the floor are prevalent.  Trash litters the
floor.  The ashes of a long-ago fire are in one corner, explaining the char
marks along that wall.

Iron Street~
Iron street is in a working class part of Var Bandor, and is far from
being one of the nicer areas in the city.  Men walk about along the street
going about their business, and few seem to notice you here.  Some small,
cramped houses line the streets between the larger warehouses, and some
children wearing ragged clothes can be seen playing outdoors.  The people
here do not seem as happy as those in the nicer parts of the city a faint
air of oppression hangs over the working class folk of Iron Street.  The
citywall is to the west, and the back of a building is east.

A Warehouse~
Large boxes of various items being shipped in and out of port fill the
room, leaving only a small, twisting aisle between them.  Only a few small
windows at the top of the room let in any light, and even that light is
barely enough to be noticed.  A large, metal chute is built into the back of
the warehouse, to send things down to the docks.  The warehouse\@ exit leads
back into Iron Street to the north.

Iron Street Foundry~
Huge cauldrons of molten iron are the most numerous item in the foundry. 
Some are being heated over huge furnaces, just turning the yellow-orange
color of heated ore while others are being lifted over molds and tilted to
dump their contents into cast molds.  Hissing and the ringing of metal on
metal assault your ears as finished casts are being thrust into barrels of
salt water or oil, depending on the finish wanted for the item or if a
worker is putting some finishing touches on a cast with his hammer.  You can
exit back to Iron street to the north.

The Blacksmith~
It\@s thrice hotter inside the blacksmith\@s than it is on the street.  A
thick curtain of smoke hangs in the air, and metal shavings cover the floor.
Three large, hot furnaces are built into the far wall, creating the immense
heat of this room.  An anvil and hammer sit off near the far corner, along
with a barrel full of cool water.  A large pile of scrap metal sits off in
one corner, waiting to be molded into something.  North leads from the near
unbearable temperature back unto the street.

The Wheelwright\@s~
The room is filled with a thick dust created from wood-shavings, making
it hard to breathe.  Large logs are lined up against the far wall, waiting
to be cut into wheels and spokes.  A large oven takes up the west wall, made
to smoke the wood boards so they would bend into shape.  A few saws and
other instruments for carving hang against the wall waiting to be used. 
Below them are a few half finished wheels, cut crudely.  Sawdust and hay
blanket the floor, causing dust to billow up and fill the room with every
motion.  If you wished to leave, your only option is to return to the street
to the north.

Sadrent Road~
Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.

The Saurian Armory~
This armory is unusually hot, presumably both because of the kiln against
the shop\@s north wall, and because of the tastes of its clientele.  An anvil
sits prominently near it, with a variety of tools stewn haphazardly about
the room.  Examples of the shop\@s unique wares hang from the walls, the
mounted skull-masks and intricately carved metal plates leering from the
aging walls.  Various hide and bone fetishes serve as the room\@s only other
apparent decorations, giving the entire affair a far more barbarous feel. 
The floor is marked by small scorches, where still-hot metal made a lasting
impression upon it.  To the south is Raddin Street, and the far cooler air
of the city.

Discount Guides of Var Bandor~
A small room fronts this establishment, a curtained-off door concealing
anything further in.  A creaky old desk fills entirely too much of the room,
covered in papers and carefully-stacked scrolls.  The walls are covered in
old handbills announcing bounties long since collected, gladiatorial bouts
from at least a year ago, and a few advertisments for local shops.  The
floor is kept cleaner than anything else in the place, and it too bears the
signs of too many feet walking over it.

The room reeks of alcohol and other smells that aren\@t so easily

no means run down.  A plain check-in desk sits in the middle of the room,
and a small brownish stool just behind that.  A few other chairs that don\@t
look stable enough to support much weight lie scattered about but that\@s it
in the way for furniture.

A Run-down House~
This house is still remotely homely: the owner seems to have done
whatever he could to make it inviting, but did not keep it up well.  A hole
is in one wall, letting the eastern light fall directly on the bed.  You
hear the faint squeaking of many rodents, and skittering claws in the walls.
However, a faded landscape of rolling hills is slowly disintegrating with
time, on the western wall.

A Brightly-Lit Shop~
A fortune\@s worth of glass fronts this shop, its meticulous frosting
obscuring the dreary cobbles of Iron Street.  A fireplace set into the side
wall wards off the damp and fills the room with a fragrant pine scent;
enough to mute the acrid tinge from the tannery next door.  Thin stone
columns support the raised ceiling, making this building taller than those
around it.  Above, a massive and opulent golden chandelier lights the shop,
its smoke and those of the steel sconces about the room darkening the roof\@s
wooden beams.  At the back of the store is a low, wide counter, providing an
easy work surface for final clothing alterations.

This large, thick pane of glass represents a king\@s fortune in platinum,
allowing sunlight to filter into the shop along the entire northern wall. 
The surface has been frosted to partially obscure the dismal poverty just
outside.  Upon close examination, faint lines of magical reinforcement are
visible, to prevent an errant rock from ruining the shopfront.

Tanner\@s Shop~
Exotic skins and hides of all types are on display here.  The local
proprietor pays good money for the hides brought in by rangers and others of
their profession.  Some half-finished hides are stretched out on wooden
frames behind the counter and yet others are still curing in a small shed in
the far corner of the store.  Iron street lies to the north.

Leather Shop~
A thin layer of dust is visible throughout this building, which clearly
was once a leather shop of some sort.  Bare hooks line the walls, where once
merchandise must have hung.  An old counter sits near the back, emptied and
dusty.  A small sign tacked up to the wall indicates that the prior owner
was forced to close shop due to a family emergency, and that there is no
planned date of re-opening.  To the north, you can hear the sounds and
bustle of Iron Street.

An Empty House~
This house seems to have been lived in rather recently, but the tenants
have since moved on in their existences.  A few, ragged blankets still line
the northern wall, however, judging from the droppings left behind, they got
their most recent use from some sort of rodent.  You can exit the house to
the north by squeezing through some loosely hung boards.

Irrasa\@s Residence~
This moderately-sized residence is somewhat unusual for a scholar\@s
abode, in that everything is put away neatly.  Gone is the usual scattering
of possessions hither and yon.  The floor is neatly swept, and covered with
precisely placed rugs.  The walls are, expectedly, lined with bookshelves,
but each book seems to be categorized and in its place.  A few floating
globes drift about in mid-air, containing living ferns or flowers.

Sadrent Road~
Sadrent Road runs the length of northern Var Bandor, winding its way
through the worst parts of town.  Built on the delta when Var Bandor was
founded, the northern buildings are the oldest, and consequently have become
the slum area.  Sadrent Road itself is a wide band of filthy cobblestones
winding between the ruined buildings.

A Run-Down Weaponry~
This small store is particularly cramped and showing of age.  The ceiling
is cracked across the center, and the paint and plaster look aged and in
some need of repair.  Despite this, examples of the shop\@s unusual wares
hang along the walls on display, made primarily of wood and iron.  Weapons
of all types are arrayed throughout the shop, leaning or mounted.  The floor
is worn and rickety, and the shop\@s main counter is battered and worn from
years of sales.  Smaller work can be done in a small kiln in the back room,
but that seems more for repairs or modifications than to create the massive
wares the shop sells.  Raddin Street lies through the door to the north.

A Dingy Office~
This one-room office is small and hopelessly seedy.  Dirty grey plaster
is cracked and bubbled in many places, stains and discolorations covering
the surface.  The roofbeams sag wearily, and the creaky floor is bowed and
warped.  Equally flimsy chairs are lined against the eastern wall.  The room
smells of damp and mold, and apparently hasn\@t been cleaned in years.  A
high desk, built to eliminate the need for a stool, sits opposite the
chairs.  An incredibly grimy window is made of dozens of thick, blurry panes
of cheap glass.  The window admits slightly less light than the open doorway
beside it which leads north out of the room.

A Warehouse~
This part of the warehouse is cluttered with many different boxes,
ranging in size from small, to large enough for you to stand in.  But though
there are so many crates, the organization of the rest of the warehouse is
prevailent here as well.  A space is left through the boxes, a thin trail
going south and east, to other parts of the warehouse.

A Warehouse~
The towers of crates seem a bit unsteady, but none have fallen over. 
Yet.  Workers busily walk around, efficently setting their burdens down
where ever they belong.  West the warehouse continues with it\@s mysterious
boxes of unknown things, and south lies the entrance to the warehouse.  East
appears to be where the bolts of cloth are kept, a bright collage of
material.

A Warehouse~
Bolts of cloth are piled around, ranging from soft, expensive silks that
are covered to protect them from the dust, to roughly woven wool, the drab
material almost matching the floor it sits on.  The multicoloured cloth is a
nice relief to the hundreds of brown boxes that are stacked around,
overwhelming in their number.  The rest of the warehouse lies to the west,
down aisles of crates and packages.

and in the distance, people wander through the sacred halls.  To the east is
the Altar of Neutrality, and south is the healer.

A Warehouse Room~
There is dust here, unlike in the rest of the warehouse, and the boxes
seem less neatly placed, some sitting alone or off to the corner and
forgotten.  The bustle of the rest of the warehouse is nonexistant, and
there is little to no traffic moving new crates in, or taking the old out. 
The rest of the warehouse lies to the north, going on with business as
usual.

A Warehouse~
The warehouse is taller than most buildings in Var Bandor, with the
exception of the occaisional inn or rich merchants house.  Boxes and crates
are neatly stacked all around, everything seeming to be well organized. 
Some workers carry large sacks that smell of exotic spices, and pile them up
to the east.  Most of the workers are carrying or pushing their burdens
north, to place the cartons in their rightful spot, among the pillars of
packages.  South, Dantaron Road bustles along, the noise pouring in through
the open doorway.

Sacks of all different sizes are piled here, each set with the others of
their sort.  A particularly small pile of bags almost overwhelm all who walk
near with their scent, and the workers make a wide bredth for them, or hold
their breath when forced to go close.  The organization of the rest of the
warehouse to the west is well apparent here, though, and each worker goes
about his tasks quickly.

The Temple of Var Bandor~
Pillars of white marble rise up, their elegant height holding up a thick
roof of the same stone.  The floor is white marble as well, fine lines
running through the well polished surface.  The entire area has a feeling of
tranquility, a calm stop along the chaotic path of life.  If you venture
further to the north, the altar of light stands, basking in perpetual
sunshine.  Northeast lies the altar of neutrality, and east lies the shadowy
altar to the dark.

An Empty Alleyway~
This is more a very small alcove than much of an alleyway, a tiny space
crammed between an old warehouse and a shipping office.  Some piles of junk
lie shoved against the wall, a handy storage space for things people haven\@t
gotten around to throwing away yet, and trash and an empty mug or two lie
scattered about.  It is very dark, barely any light coming in from the road
or sky, and unseen eyes watch from the shadows at the rear of this niche. 
Aragol Street goes by south of here, most walking by the alleyway without a
glance.

The western gatehouse of Var Bandor opens before you, the towering walls
of the city rising to the north and south.  A close watch is being kept on
the travelers entering and leaving the city, and a roster of those banned
from the area is kept nearby.  To the east, Dantaron Street runs to the
heart of Var Bandor, and to the west is the docks area.

The gatehouse is a typical one, providing extra fortifications at this
key point along the city walls, and framing the sturdy reinforced gates.  In
a niche to one side of the gatehouse, the mechanism of cogs, weights and
pulleys that operates the gate is housed.  You see there the lever which can
be pulled to open or shut the gates.

within the circular basin.  The rim of the basin appears designed for
seating, but is sprinkled with water.  The square is mortared with rounded
cobblestone radiating outwards from the fountain.  The sounds and smells of
the market and other popular locales nearby mingle in the air.

Inside the Eastern Gatehouse~
The eastern gatehouse of Var Bandor opens before you, the towering walls
of the city rising to the north and south.  A close watch is being kept on
the travelers entering and leaving the city, and a roster of those banned
from the area is kept nearby.  To the west, Aragol Street runs to the heart
of Var Bandor, and to the east is the docks area.

gatehouse gate gates lever niche mechanism~
The gatehouse is a typical one, providing extra fortifications at this
key point along the city walls, and framing the sturdy reinforced gates.  In
a niche to one side of the gatehouse, the mechanism of cogs, weights and
pulleys that operates the gate is housed.  You see there the lever which can
be pulled to open or shut the gates.

The Looter\@s Chalice~
The Looter\@s Chalice is a poor example of a bar, the paint on the walls
peeling off in large strips that don\@t seem to ever get swept away.  In
fact, it appears as though the touch of a broom or mop has never been felt
on these floors, and your feet stick to the old beer on the ground.  The
patrons of the pub seem sullen, and disreputable at best.  More than one
customer has passed out in his ale, and will most likely awake to find his
purse missing, if he was fool enough to take it here.  To the south, many
people are crowded by a few tables, the rattle of falling dice heard in
moments of anxious quiet.  North is the door back to Dantaron Road, standing
open in welcome perhaps, though from the look of the rusty hinges, if the
door was moved it would fall right over.

The Boatseller\@s~
The boatsellers shop is big out of necessity, the boats out for people to
buy taking up a large amount of space.  The shop seems in good repair, and
the boats you can examine are all well put together, and seem like quality
workmanship.  The only exit is to the north, where the Dantaron Road runs
along.

A Room in the Inn~
The room is tidy, if small, and seems to contain all you would need to
stay a night.  A very comfortable looking bed invites you to rest a while on
its soft blankets and fluffy pillow.  The floor is cold stone, but a small
woven rug lies before each bed, so as not to add the shock of cold feet to
getting up in the morning.  A wooden table sits next to the bed, with a
candleholder and two candles set beside it, the aroma of beeswax hanging
faintly in the air.  On the opposite wall of the bed, a sturdy looking
dresser sits, with a small wavy mirror set above it.  The only exit is to
the west, a thick wooden door leading back to the hallway.

The Journey\@s End~
The Journey\@s End is a nice inn, though with closer examination you note
cobwebs that would not be present if this inn were in a more reputable part
of town.  A small bar stands in one corner, but most of the hard core
drinkers will go to one of the other numerous pubs along the road.  The
innkeeper stands behind the bar, accepting coin for his rooms upstairs, and
for food and drink alike.  The inn continues to the south, with more tables
for customers to sit down and relax, and there is a small door behind the
bar leading to the innkeeper\@s personal room.  North is the door back to the
bustle of Dantaron Road.

The Innkeeper\@s Room~
The innkeeper\@s room is neat and orderly, and seems almost bare of any
sort of personality.  Apparently, the innkeeper spends most of his time out
in the main part of The Journey\@s End.  A single bed is pushed into one
corner, the covers folded back, ready for whenever the innkeeper retires for
the night.  A short table stands next to it, completely bare of any sort of
decoration, and a small bookcase is against the opposite wall, but the
shelves are mostly bare.  The only exit is to the west, back to the main
room of The Journey\@s End.

A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.  The Var Bandor Center Square is to the north.

The Nymph\@s Tears~
A small raised platform is set into the northwest corner of the room, and
a dark velvet curtain encircles the bottom.  The wooden tables are spread
around, most of the chairs angled to face the small stage.  A large tapestry
hangs on the western wall, depicting a beautiful nymph with tears running
down her face, to create a small pool at her feet.  The fanciful picture is
obviously where the tavern gets its name, and the name of their special
strong liquor.  A small doorway on the southern wall marks the entrance to
the bards guild, and the bar continues to the east.

The Nymph\@s Tears~
This tavern looks a higher class than most buildings around this area,
being clean and well kept.  The bar on the east wall is dark polished oak,
the warm gleam unmarred by scratches or scars.  Rows of clean, sparkling
glasses are set above the bar, waiting to be filled with one of the exotic
imported drinks, or some dark, frothy ale.  West is a small stage, and some
sturdy tables for the patrons to rest their drinks on, as they sit and watch
the show.  North is the door back to Aragol Street, a faint fishy odour
wafting in to mingle with the sweet scents of liquor.

A Broad Side Street~
Leading south of Aragol Street, a broad side road leads between two
warehouses of Var Bandor.  The street is paved with granite blocks, and
is surprisingly well-maintained.  West is a solidly-built prison, and to
the east are the entry stairs of the Hall of Law, headquarters of the
Guardians of Law.
  A large sign by the side of the street reads:
  
            *** WARNING!  ***
To the east is the Hall of Law.  Those not of the
Guardians of Law are forbidden entry.  Intrusion
will be punished with death.

The Beast and Bandit~
The entrance to this bar arches high above head, allowing easy entrance
for even the tallest of alatharya.  A large statue stands by the doorway
carved in the finest of detail.  Lingering in the air is the smell of cooked
meat, alcohol and burning wood from the fireplace.  Hung upon the walls are
trophies from different beasts of the land.  A handful of large tables are
spaced evenly about the room.  The bar itself is a long plank, cut from a
dark, ancient oak.  A tall archway leads to a lounge further to the south.

E
statue~
The statue before you is rather monumental in size.  It features a tall,
grinning man holding a dead stag out at his side.  The stag is done in
striking detail, so much so that it appears to have been simply turned to
stone from life.  Its fur is shown matted and clumped as if with blood, and
a few large wounds have been made in its side.  A hunting spear is thrust
through its belly, which is similarly covered with blood, and its head turns
at an unnatural angle, resting against the rocks of the statue\@s base. 
Tongue hanging limply out of its mouth.  It is held up on its hind legs by
the grinning man to the piece\@s right.  

The man is displaying a thick-lipped grin as he presents his kill with one
massive hand.  He is dressed in many fine things, including a breastplate
with inlays that appear to be made of diamonds.  His eyes are narrowed
slightly by his cheeks, yet his face gives off an aura of complete pleasure
and self-satisfaction.  A long ponytail of hair trails down the statue\@s
heavily muscled back, its strands resting between two very detailed
shoulderblades.  He is clearly alatharyan.  

At the bottom of the statue, an engraving has been made.  It reads \#Bodisous
Bofarin welcomes you to the Beast and Bandit.\#  Below this is written, in a
similarly-sized text \#By Isal Achia, Mistress of Sculpture.\#

E
tables~
Five sturdy tables allow a place for you to eat and drink.  Each table is
made from a different type of wood.  A long mahogany table sits in a far
corner away from the bar.  A table made from thick maple stands in the
center of the room.  A square, pine table sits between the exit and the back
of the bar.  A stained, circular oaken table sits close to the bar and a
smooth birch table sits near the entrance.  
~
E
trophy~
Looking at the different trophies hung upon the wall you see jaws from
sharks, bearskins, bjorcha horns and many large sets of antlers.  Behind the
bar upon a shelf is an enormous stuffed trout of the kind native to Jasa
Lake.

The Dicing Tables~
The atmosphere is heavy with expectation and tension, the gamers all
crowded over their tables, playing and making bets on other players.  Many
seem to dice with an almost feverish gleam, their piles of coin growing
tall, or being reduced to a few silver, but the players hardly seem to
notice.  There is quiet talk among the people betting on the games, and the
occasional shout of joy or disgust, but other than that, there is little
noise beyond the rattle of falling dice.  The bar lies to the north, for
those who come here for the liquor, but few of the dicers seem to take much
note of it.

house.  A large vase, housing a rare, exotic flowering tree, occupies the
northeast corner of the room, competing with the eccentric, marble furniture
for the most unusual piece decorating the chamber.  A mirror hangs on the
eastern wall, and you glance into it with some trepidation, seeing that it
reflects the room behind you without detecting your presence.  The faint
aroma of lemon drops lingers in the air, giving you the faint impression of
open space.

merchants in the town, Pedhebath likes to use fair prices to bring in more
customers to the many stores he owns.  One of the the two pieces of art in
the room is a picture of his mother and the other, the mayor of Var Bandor.

The Merchant\@s Coffer Inn~
An elegantly decorated building of the finest construction, the
Merchant\@s Coffer Inn serves the elite mercantile class of Var Bandor with
its gourmet dishes and superb wines.  Meticulously clean, the tables are
carefully laid with fine silver and delicate ceramic dishes.  The faint
sound of sophisticated music floats through the Inn.

Ilrin Street~
A wide street composed of black stones and carefully-arranged curbs,
Ilrin Street runs the length of southern Var Bandor, winding among the
gloriously rich houses of the merchants and the eccentrically constructed
towers of the scholars.  Here and there, baskets of flowers hang from the
sides of buildings, and hired servants tend to shaped shrubs.  The streets
in the southern part of town are swept clean, and all animal traffic is
prohibited.

An Oddly-Formed Residence~
An upward sloping path leads to a pillar-lined doorway at the front of
this house, set apart from the surrounding architecture by the organic,
disorganized shape.  Apparently constructed of polished granite, the curves
and twists draw the eye along, preventing you from fully grasping the
complete size and volume of the residence.  Along the eastern side, strange
sigils have been carved, big enough to be visible from a fair distance.  A
small lawn encircles the grounds, home to strange, exotic flora from all
reaches of Avendar.

An Oddly-formed Residence~
The inside of this house is a sight to behold.  The room itself is much
larger than it appears from the outside, disorienting you slightly. 
Flickering flames provide a warm light, although most of the flames just
seem to be floating in mid-air by the walls, not attached to any sort of
source.  Many portraits line the walls, and magical feather dusters fly
about the room, making sure no dust mars the beautiful appearance of the
room, and its many magical toys.  A plush red couch sits against one wall,
and a small table sits in front of it.  On the table, an illusion of a
dancer moves inside a small glass globe.  Inset into the north wall, a
doorway leads into what appears to be a laboratory, and Arcanos lies out the
door to the south.

The Linguist\@s Residence~
The inside of this house is rather sparse, although it appears to be in
quite good shape.  The entire house seems to be made up of one large room,
containing a small bed, a cooking area, a wooden table, and shelf after
shelf packed with scrolls and books.  Upon the table, a feathered quill
stands in a small jar of ink, and a tome of some sort lies open, revealing
lines of a foreign language being analyzed.  The only doorway in this room
leads back out to Arcanos Street, to the south.

A Novices\@ House~
This house is sparsely furnished, and does not appear to be well-kept. 
Dirty dishes are stacked beside a basin of water, and scraps of paper
smudged with ink lie about the room.  In one corner, a table with a single
candle sits covered with a few scrolls, and the surrounding floor is spotted
with dirt.  A few books sit on the end of an old bed, their edges worn from
use.  The only exit to this place appears to be to the south, out to Gariel
street.

This house appears to be in quite good shape, as though the resident that
lives here is very well off.  A few small plants are spread throughout the
room, and all of the dishes stacked on the counter appear to be unchipped. 
A small shelf of books lies against one wall, and a couple candles sit on a
nice wooden table in the middle of the room.  A comfortable bed sits in a
small alcove near the back of the house, and to the south, a wooden door
leads back out to Gariel road.

mystic runes and symbols.

circular couch sits in the middle of this room, with cushions falling this
way and that off of it.  Silk pillows pour over the sides of the couch and a
fancy chandelier hangs from the ceiling.  A writing desk sits off in one
corner, with a quill pen and ink pot sitting atop it.  You can exit back to

the gold that flows from the prosperous trade evident in the buildings, the
clothing of the citizens, and the meticulous maintenance of the streets. 
Commerce Street turns south and east at this point, and to the west is a
magnificent structure, the headquarters of the Var Bandor Merchant Council.

unfinished maps rest atop a workdesk.  A letter is on top of the counter
addressed to the Wanderers of Avendar, that is likely how this Cartographer
gets his information, however, the price is probably not a cheap one.

The sounds of a hammer ringing as it strikes a piece of iron is the first
thing that assaults your ears as you enter the store.  You can also hear the
whishing of the bellows as it blows into the furnace to increase the heat of
the fire.  Shirts made of fine steel, leggings, sleeves, and assorted mails
of all type are all on display hanging from the walls.  Besides the forge
near the back of the store, the rest of the building looks immaculately
clean giving a sense of regality not normally associated with a smithy-type
shop.  You can exit back to the west.

This narrow alley connects Gariel and Arcanos Streets by running between
two buildings.  The normal filth and squalor normally associated with most
dark to semi-dark alleyways is not present here.  The alley is as clean as
the streets as if as much attention was paid to its sweeping as the rest of
the roads.  The alley continues east to Gariel Street and west.

Arcanos Street~
Arcanos Street is a wide avenue paved with gray stones.  The buildings in

Bandor, this area is well cared for, with hired servants sweeping the
cobblestones and running errands to and fro.  To the west, a sinister black
door leads to the Chamber of the Void.

The Var Bandor Scribe~
Young scholar students studiously scribe scrolls to be sold here.  They
practice this to further their skills and also to gain some profit for the
Var Bandor scholar faction.  Parchments, quills, and candles line the few
desks that are located here.  The wand-making room is to the north, while
the staff creators are to the east.

The Var Bandor Staff-maker~
This small shop has been erected by the Var Bandor scholar faction, both
to raise money for their purposes, and to spread the perceived influence of
the scholars.  Staves constructed by students of various spheres are for
sale to the public at large, although such wonderous artifacts exact a heavy
price.

The Rare Nefortu~
A small and elegant affair, this shop fits well in the upscale merchant
quarter of Var Bandor.  The hardwood floor is a polished cherry, partially
covered by a fine area rug, with matching wood paneling.  Ornate sconces are
mounted throughout the room, lighting the room with a warm, magical glow. 
The south wall is decorated with a gold-framed landscape of Lithling valley
and its vineyards, with low racks beneath to show off some of the store\@s
rich inventory.  A long counter is on the eastern side of the room, the
surface finished in black.  Behind it, a portrait of the establishment\@s
titular nefortu hangs proudly for all to see.  A set of stairs against the
west wall leads downward to a lower level, an engraved gold plaque placed on
the wall just before the first step.  A wooden door to the north leads back
to Commerce Street.

portrait titular nefortu~
The image of a male nefortu has been captured in this picture. 
Fluttering on leather wings, his frame is wide and thick, but lacks in the
vertical aspect.  He looks as if to measure around four feet tall.  His bald
head reflects even the smallest amounts of light, and is completely devoid
of hair aside from the eyebrows.  Dark auburn eyes look about sternly and a
short yet thick jawbone stretches his lips into an awkward smile.  A set of
lean and well-toned arms dangle from his thick shoulders.  His legs descend
limply from his torso, appearing almost fragile.

This store is rather large, arranged in a wide square around a central
podium at which the merchant sits.  The east wall of the store is lined with
various stringed instruments, featuring rows upon rows of guitars, violins,
viols, cellos, and so on.  The west wall of the store sports racks of wind
and brass instruments, ranging from tiny piccolos near the front to large
tubas near its rear.  The back of the store features two separate rooms in
which percussion instruments are stored.  Each smaller ante-room is lined
with thick cotton padding to dull the sounds of those who want to practice
an instrument before they play it, and with a number of variously-sized
drums.

This alleyway is draped in shadows, wedged as it is between the
instrument shop and a cloistered, wealthy home.  The walls, barely an
armspan apart at the base, seem to lean inwards slightly, allowing only a
narrow strip of sky overhead.  The greyish cobbles are dingy and dirty,
coated with the detritus of long years.  A door leads west at the very end
of the alley, shadowed and recessed deeply in the wall, and a low storage
alcove runs eastward down under the foundation of a home.  North, the road
opens up onto the far cleaner and brighter Commerce Street.

Gariel Street~
Gariel Street is a narrow avenue winding through the scholar district of
Var Bandor.  Paved with gray stones, the street curves among various
scholars\@ residences and buildings of unknown purpose.  The buildings and
street are swept regularly, judging by the state of cleanliness.  To the
south is a small stone house.

Inside the Southern Gatehouse~
The southern gatehouse of Var Bandor is an elaborate affair,
well-maintained and proper.  A close watch is kept on the kind of traveler
allowed to enter the finest districts of the city, and a roster of those
banned from the area is kept nearby.  The immense granite walls rise to
either side of the gates, and to the south, the outskirts of Var Bandor run
into a thickly wooded area.  North, Ilrin Street leads into the heart of the
city.

gatehouse gate gates lever niche mechanism~
The gatehouse is a typical one, providing extra fortifications at this
key point along the city walls, and framing the sturdy reinforced gates.  In
a niche to one side of the gatehouse, the mechanism of cogs, weights and
pulleys that operates the gate is housed.  You see there the lever which can
be pulled to open or shut the gates.

Toromia\@s Laboratory~
This unusual laboratory was probably a residence once, but its interior
has been entirely reworked for creation.  Shaped figures and body parts,
ranging from simple stone to iron to forged steel, are organized by type and
material.  Assembled, but inanimate, statues stand in rows, waiting to be
granted the unlife for which the shop is so well-known.  A large counter is
lined with tools and magic devices, bearing runic markings of Earth and
Void.  The room\@s sparse decorations are lost amongst the statues, and the
only exit leads north onto Arcanos Street.

Shaped pieces, such as upper and lower arms, articulated hands, thighs,
lower legs, and feet, are arranged first by set, and then by material.  A
variety of different heads, ranging from pleasant stone, to featureless
mannequin heads, to skull-like forged steel.  Runed ball and socket joints
are set for insertion into different torsos, as well as joints for wrists
and ankles.

Various dangerous-looking tools and devices with diabolic runes are

number of seals, wards, and focusing crystals ensure that the automatons
stay in place-- just in case.  Special gears are laid out for custom work,
each bearing similarly dark inscriptions as the rest.

still well-constructed and expensive.  A fine carpet covers the floor.  To

the bar seems to have sustained more abuse than is normal for the high

The Tipsy Swordmaster~
The Tipsy Swordmaster is a tavern frequented by the less wealthy
mercenary classes of Var Bandor.  Filled with thick smoke from tobacco
pipes, the large common room of the tavern is filled with the loud sounds of
drinking warriors.  Some scattered tables are filled with boisterous
warriors to the east and west, and the common area is to the south.  Through
some well-travelled doors, the street lies north.

The common room of the Tipsy Swordmaster is a riot of activity. 
Waitresses work their way through the crowd, stolidly ignoring the ogling of
the crowd of rowdy warriors.  The room is illuminated by cast iron lanterns,
which hang down from the ceiling on long chains, serving as a crude sort of
chandelier.  The inn stretches out in all directions, though more people
seem to be clustered about the bar to the south.

tavern, drawn by the shouts of the barbarians for more drink.  Some
scattered tables are north, while the main bar is to the west.

ripped up for sale, calling to mind a gap toothed grin.  The room continues
to the east and south, and a door is visible off on the east wall.

floorboards suggest this was a very long time ago.  The stairwell leads up
from the southwest corner, while the rest of the room opens to the north and

covered by a scrap or two of fine purple drapes that must have once

sink into decrepitude, or until the trends of fortune once again look kindly
on this place.

This high ceilinged chamber is opulently decorated, a mosaic of
semiprecious stones in the floor forming the simple crest of the Council of
Var Bandor Scholars.  Tall windows stretch from floor to ceiling, all around
the walls of the oval room.  Gilded faux pillars line the walls between each
window.  A ceiling of pressed plaster is painted in bright colors, from
which hang two ornate chandeliers.  The gleaming brass and crystal fixtures
light the room with tall beeswax tapers.  The walls are painted a rich
orange-red, and a long table of wood, polished to a glowing sheen, dominates
the eastern end of the room.  The room continues to the west, where an iron

The Chamber of Water~
The dominant faction in the tower, the scholars of water who use these
facilities have the lion\@s share of the resources.  A few beds are here for
the most injured who seek out the scholar\@s assistance.  Some open scrolls
are on tables, and a few blue robed scholars drift about the room, engrossed
in magical research.  The tower continues to the west, and a stairwell leads
north.

A Small Library~
This library is the common property of the Var Bandorian Tower of Water. 
Smalls shelves are filled with numerous books and scrolls, most bound in
sapphire blue with gold inlay.  The library is undersized, as few mages live
in the tower proper, and most maintain their own private collections.  The
tower continues to the west, and a stairwell lies north.

The Scrying Pool~
The bulk of this room is dominated by a large grey stone basin, filled
with crystal clear water.  Runes of water and spirit are carved in the
basin, circling its lip.  Used by the scholars for discernment of far away
places, the Council often makes use of this magic.  To the east the room
joins a small library through a white marble arch.  Small, slitted windows
in the north, south, and western walls allow views of the southeastern
section of Var Bandor, the pyramidical roofs and black-stone streets
stretching away.

This foyer is the waiting chamber for the Tower of Earth, home to one of
Var Bandor\@s most powerful scholar factions.  The chamber appears to be
carved from a block of pure marble, the faint colorations from impurities
forming weird geometric forms on the wall.  Smooth stone chairs sit east and
west, while doors lead north and south.

ancient scholar\@s Covenant.  Thick walls and a doubly enforced ceiling
indicate that little will shake this room.  A lectern stands at the southern
end of the room, used for the ocassional talk given here.  An opaque crystal
door leads north, while the exit east is through plain wood.

This spacious chamber is used as both a scholar council chamber and a

granite counter that lines the east and south walls.  Set in the counter are
shelves filled with stone samples.  In the center of the room, a long table
sits flanked by slender chairs.  The dark polished wood of the table is
inset with a mosaic of polished semi-precious gems.  A sandstone door lies

getting up in the morning.  A wooden table sits next to the bed, with a
candleholder and two candles set beside it, the aroma of beeswax hanging
faintly in the air.  On the opposite wall of the bed, a sturdy looking
dresser sits, with a small wavy mirror set above it.  The only exit is to
the north, a thick wooden door leading back to the hallway.

Erstaphus\@ Study~
Erstaphus\@s study is done up in oak and ironwood, with every piece
polished to a fine hue.  A lacquered desk serves to cover most of the south
wall, behind which is a small tapestry.  The center of the room is
relatively clear, to allow access to a series of intricately carved shelves,
which cover the other three walls of the room.  A testament to the tastes of
the room\@s owner, the shelves house a number of rather unusual artifacts,
ranging from several small statues of unknown beasts to old manuscripts,
rotting from age.  Each entry on the shelves is labelled with a small
plaque, cataloguing the contents.  The only exit from the study is through a
door to the west.

The room is large and cozy, plushly furnished and welcoming.  A warm fire
burns in the stonework fireplace, shedding a soft light over the
surroundings.  The air is filled with the scents of wood and pipe smoke, and
there is a constant faint noise from the Nymph\@s Tears.  A few torches line
the wall, making the room just barely bright enough to read.  The walls are
lined with a few paintings, centered between various bookcases and cabinets
holding treasure from far off lands.  Northwards lies the door to the
tavern, and to the east you see a small doorway leading to the music room.

The room is paneled all the way around in dark wood, muffling the sounds
from the nearby tavern.  Various stands and displays have been set up
throughout the room, evidence of many students toil over perfecting the
telling of certain songs and stories.  Pasted on the walls at random places
are sheets of music, held with small pins, from times when the music room
was too crowded for each bard to have their own stand.  By the door on the

Sing/Speak from your stomach, not your throat.

Be sure to keep your posture erect or you won\@t
have as much air in your lungs.

Eye-contact is essential in involving an audience.

A story or song must be started in some interesting
manner, or no one will bother to listen.  Be creative
and original.

How you finish is equally important to how you begin.
Be sure to pace yourself appropriately.

Your instruments are your tools of expression,
they both aid and limit you.  Take good care of them.

A Back Room in the Beast and Bandit~
A large wide back room to the Beast and Bandit, the walls are covered
with cunning sketches of Avendar\@s fairest at their best.  Two solid stools
are set up in a corner, a small table between them.  A ring of sorts is set
in the center of the room.  Many layers of thick cloth padding line the
floor, stained with blood and sweat.  

An enormous chair, carved from ironwood and covered with hides and crowned with a set of antlers sits here.

E
fairest~
Large sketches of tastefully nude females cover the walls.  Ethron,
alatharya, aelin, human, and caladaran all displayed in great detail,
sketched by a masterful hand.  Fair and scantily dressed, these beauties
posed for the artist in exotic and tantalizing positions.

The Temple of Flesh~
Dark, unholy energies pulse overhead through this chamber, which serves
as some sort of desecrated shrine.  Near the center of the room is an altar,
made from a large polyp of quivering, almost putrescent flesh.  Above it
dangle tentacles, which are attached to some unearthly maw that grows out of
the ceiling.  Arranged in a circle around the altar are pools of some active
black goo, which sputter and splatter against the walls of translucent
fleshy cylinders.  Cut into the flesh of the floor is a diabolical symbol,
formed from oozing gray blood.  The only exit from the chamber lies to the
west, through an elaborate door made of intricately connected bone.

Chamber of the Master~
Judged by the grisly aesthetic of the lair, these chambers are lavish. 
Organic concretions grow here, formed into exotic shapes which serve no
visible purpose, but do manage to take up the majority of the chamber\@s
volume.  A shallow, semicircular pool lies flush with the western wall, but
it is completely empty and the bottom is smooth stone.  Several alcoves are
formed from chunks taken out of the walls, which are made from pink and
quivering flesh.  The only exit from this chamber is through a gash in the
wall to the east.

A Tentacled Corridor~
This dark, damp corridor is alive with rubbery, clammy tentacles. 
Wriggling, they grow from the walls and ceiling of this place, writhing
toward any trace of heat or life.  The floor is made of some bulbous, fleshy
substance, which seems organic, if not quite as animate as the tentacles. 
To both the west and the north, the corridor opens into larger chambers. 
Eastward, there is a large door, constructed entirely of intricately

Near a Pool of Ichor~
Most of this chamber\@s floor is taken up by a pool of slick, glistening
ichor, colored a deep, sickening blue.  The pool stands about three inches
off the floor, supported by a lip of pink, trembling flesh.  Overhead,
encrusted organic structures have affixed themselves to the skin of the
ceiling.  The largest of these is a sort of living stalactite, which dangles
down to a point over the pool, into which it drips a slimy excretion.  A
gash in the western wall is the only exit from this chamber.

but various portions of the pool clear every so often, allowing the viewer
to look in the pool.

An Unsettling Laboratory~
This magical laboratory is distinctly alien in both form and function. 
The proportions are subtly disconcerting, sized for someone slightly taller
than a human or a shuddeni, but with twice the reach.  The implements here
are all organic -- from a dissecting table made from a rectangular
parallelpiped of living flesh, to a bookshelf made from some type of bone. 
Erupting from the floor near the table are several fleshy protuberances,
each filled with a different sinister fluid.  Gashes in the fleshy walls of
the chamber lead east, west, and south.

the things, and they quiver with motion, gradually squeezing sinister and
viscous fluids into a transparent bulb at the tip of the protuberance.  

The fluid in each bulb is of a different color.  It is possibly to more
closely examine the FIRST, SECOND, or THIRD protuberance.

A Chamber of Flesh~
This underground chamber is hewn not from stone or soil, but is rather a
cleft in the bulk of some great mass of flesh.  The walls and floor
palpitate in harmony with some alien, discordant rhythm, and black fluid
pulses through the barely translucent surface of the chamber.  A mound of
gray slime slopes up against the northern parts of the room, ascending to a
rubbery slit in the ceiling.  A door made of pulsing flesh is set into the
east wall.
