seraph cohort mob_4430~
a seraph of the Cohort~
A seraph is here, arrayed for war.
~
This seraph is incredibly beautiful by almost any aesthetic.  Eyes of
ancient wisdom are set in a proud face.  Four wings, over ten feet across,
spring gracefully from the seraph\@s shoulders and hips.  The seraph emits an
incredible glow, and wisps of white fire occasionally dance and flicker over
its sun-bright skin.

A cake of dried meat lies on the ground.~
Pemmican is a nutritious mixture of lean meat and bone marrow fat,
traditionally created by the Ryarl.  Preparation involves drying the meat
over a fire, pounding it with stones until it is almost a powder, then
mixing it with an equal amount of fat.  Dried, powdered fruits, such as
raspberries or blueberries, may then be added to the pemmican.  Among the
Ryarl, cloudberry pemmican is reserved for rituals honoring Girikha.

This is a long section of bjorcha sinew rope, prized by the Ryarl for its
toughness, reliability, and slight elasticity.  Made from the long leg
ligatures of the big animals, the sinew is dried very slowly and carefully
rubbed with fat, preserving a slight springiness.  This springiness is
incredibly important to those who climb in hazardous terrain; a rope with a
bit of \@give\@ can mean the difference between a jarred back and a sprained
or broken one when stopping a fall.  Hunters, prospectors, and traders alike
seek ropes braided by the Ryarl, as the durability and quality are not
matched anywhere else in the world.

making a loud clapping noise near the bjorcha\@s ear.  Outside of Ryarl, the
whip is called a snakewhip due to its resemblance to a snake when coiled. 
However, no snakes live in the frozen tundra that is the Ryarl homeland, and
the kankoran there refer to this whip as a \@hokiamna,\@ or \@clapwhip.  \@

pure crystal flute blue bluish~
A delicately-carved crystal flute cut from smokey-blue quartz is here. 
The crystal\@s masterful cut seems to catch and refract any light that
touches it, giving it a faintly glowing appearance.  Delicate, whorling
etchings curve along the length of the instrument, the traceries skirting
the holes in a cascading pattern of waves.

a small spray of rowan leaves~
A small spray of rowan leaves lie here.~
The rowan holds many places in Avendarian lore.  Very strongly associated
with the goddess Rystaia, the tree is used in many religious ceremonies and
amulets.  Sprays of rowan leaves are used to supposedly ward off disease and
decay, and bunches of their dense berries will, according to Inessan custom,
deter witches from your household.  When the small, fragrant flowers fall in
late Spring, those reverent to the goddess take pause, for it is said that
the trees weep with her in memory for the loss of her brother Vaialos.  

Rowan trees grow in higher altitudes and dislike close woods; these further
embody the ideals of Freedom and Joy often espoused by Rystaians.  It is
also known as mountain ash, quickbeam, and witchbane.

The Western Docks of Var Bandor~
You stand near the edge of the docks of Var Bandor.  To the west, the
river Dantaron flows, murky and gray.  Its waters teem with rafts and
barges, merchants and travelers.  The docks themselves hum with activity,
dockhands unloading barges, loading new cargos, and transporting
merchandise. To the east, the stone walls of the city loom above the dock
area.

A Ferry Station~
The waters of the Dantaron River flow placidly to the north, a muddy
brown barrier to merchants, carts, and foot travelers.  A small wooden dock
has been erected at the water\@s edge, and several large ferries run by
riverfolk carry passengers back and forth between the Arien Road and the
outskirts of Var Bandor.
