a small goat~
A small mountain goat sniffs eagerly at a tuft of grass it has discovered.
~
The rugged foothills of the Saerin Ranges are home to a particularly wiry
and cunning breed of mountain goat.  This specimen is covered with gray
shaggy wool, running into dreadlocks around its belly.  Its small horns
curve back around its ears which, combined with the worn and scraped front
knees, tends to lend it a somewhat plaintive air.

Once a huge man, Eshie has only lost a little of his once legendary

rumors of Alatharya blood in his heritage may not be that unfounded. 
Although mostly tied down with the day to day running of the Lithling
operation, it is clear from his poise and bearing that he has not let his
martial skills slip in the years since he quit the adventuring life.  His
thick white hair is tied into a long plat which hangs down his back, while a

have thwarted the skill of the local healers.

Far from his homelands, this large red-furred kankoran has the
unmistakable look of a mercenary about him.  His immense stature and the
pair of wicked-looking axes crossed on his back would indicate that he is a
warrior of some note and standing in his tribe.  The size of his purse on
the other hand, and the amount of alcohol he has consumed hint that he is
not doing to badly for himself here either.

when his daughter married a local farmer of not inconsequential repute.  Now
fully retired, he spends his time with his growing family, tending the land
in little ways and generally enjoying his ripe and happy old age.  His long
hair has turned a bright silvery white, and his similarly-colored beard is
long and platted all the way down to his waist.

Kahes was tempted by the dark magical arts of the shuddeni and their shadowy

remains of the ancient sorcerer.  It looms almost eight feet tall, floating
a further foot above the ground.  Its insubstantial form appears to be
garbed in moldering dark robes, decorated with delicate silver runes of
protection and negation.  Where flesh once covered the exposed hands and
face, black writhing tendrils of darkness now hold together its
semi-corporeal form.  Its eyes burn bright against the pure darkness of the
undulating face -- two glaring points of searing blue flame that radiate
malevolence.

The Dantaron River~
The Dantaron River makes its way in between the Arien Plains to the north
and the Lithling Valley to the south, flowing from Var Bandor to Earendam,
and eventually to the Uthlin Ocean.  A short way upstream to the west, the
Aragol River joins up with the Dantaron, after passing by Var Bandor to the
southwest.  Eastward, the Dantaron flows more or less straight on, heading
for the distant city of Earendam.

Under the Lithling Bridge~
The Dantaron River passes beneath a large stone bridge here on its
journey between Var Bandor and Earendam.  The underside of the sturdy
bluestone construction looks stable and secure, a tribute to the amount of
regular care and attention that such an important civic site attracts.  East
and west, the river flows back out into the open air.

The Lithling Bridge~
Built some time soon after the War of Night, this massive bluestone
bridge serves as one of the two major fords across this section of the
Dantaron River.  Decorated with foot-high statuettes of various local
fertility spirits, as well as some barely recognizable Var Bandorian civic
leaders, it shows the signs of constant maintenance -- a necessity
considering its importance to the trade and commerce of the area.  To the
north, the Lithling road shortly joins the Arien running east-west, while to
the south it stretches away into the valley.

statues~
The small statuettes that decorate the bridge have been carved into the
likenesses of former rulers of Var Bandor, and paired off with the local
spirits that people most readily associate with their reign.  Here for
instance, the unmistakably corpulent image of Golphar the Round is being
cautiously sniffed by a locust-like famine spirit, while across from him,
One Armed Ingheli the Alchemist is trying to cram a buxom fertility spirit
into a rather small bottle.

An Outcrop Overlooking Two Rivers~
This small outcrop of rocky land provides a stunning view of the merging
of two powerful rivers.  The Aragol, which lies west of here, flows out of
the docks of Var Bandor and into the powerful stream of the Dantaron, which
lies to the north.  The city of Var Bandor itself looms large to the
southwest, its docks clearly visible some distance south on the opposite
bank of the Aragol.  The banks of the two rivers continue south and east
respectively, while the rear of the ferrymaster\@s building lies directly to
the southeast.

South of a Bridge on Lithling Road ~
The Lithling road proper begins here, winding its way south into the
heart of the valley.  As the road meanders down from the bridge to the
north, the quality of its surface deteriorates markedly, moving quickly from
the bluestone of the bridge, to gravel, to hard-packed mud and the deep
groves of cart tracks.  Of to the west, the south bank of the Dantaron
slopes away in the direction of the distant walls of Var Bandor, while to
the east, neat rows of cornfields rustle gently in the breeze.  The road
itself continues on gently downhill to the south, moving ever deeper into
the valley.

In a Corn Field~
This field is devoted to corn crop.  Plowed and planted in orderly rows,
the corn is growing strong and healthy -- a testament to the skill and care
displayed by the farming dynasties of this fertile valley.  A little way to
the north, the Dantaron River flows peacefully on from east to west.  The
cornfields continue east, while southward they give way to golden fields of
wheat.  You can just make out the start of the Lithling road to the west,
while not far to the southeast, a group of buildings indicate the location
of a large farmstead.

A Thin Trail Through Rice Paddies~
Making good use of the steep and wet slope down to the Dantaron River to
the north, farmers have covered these fields with an intricate network of
tiered layers of rice paddies.  Thin trails criss-cross the area, providing
excellent access to every conceivable nook and cranny.  The rice plantation
continues eastward, while the more level ground to the west is being used
for corn instead.  As the soil gets somewhat drier to the south, the rice
gives way to golden wheat.  Beyond the wheat fields to the south, a
two-story farmhouse rises up among some stockyards.

In a Corn Field~
This field is devoted to corn crop.  Plowed and planted in orderly rows,
the corn is growing strong and healthy -- a testament to the skill and care
displayed by the farming dynasties of this fertile valley.  A little way to
the north, the Dantaron River flows peacefully on from east to west.  The
cornfields give way to intricately tiered layers of rice paddies to the
west, while southward, fields of barley sway gently in the breeze.  A
massive wooden barn stands to the east, accessible through a large set of
double doors.

A Storage Shed~
This large musty barn serves as a storehouse for crops harvested from the
surrounding fields.  It is piled high with all manner of produce, packed
into sacks and ready for transport to various destinations in Avendar.  The
floor is covered with a thick layer of straw and the roof seems well
insulated from the weather, protecting the farmer\@s valuable investment. 
Large doors in the west wall lead out into a cornfield.

East Bank of the Aragol~
The Aragol river lies south and west of here, curving around this small
promontory as it flows out away from the docks of Var Bandor, directly to
the southwest, and on towards its imminent meeting with the Dantaron.  The
pollution here is quite bad, as all manner of refuse floats down the river
from the docks, settling on the banks or being carried further downstream by
the current.  A small outcrop of rocky ground lies north of here, while the
west side of the ferrymaster\@s building, painted a cheery green, blocks
passage eastward.

The Aragol River~
Curving away to the west here on its journey up to the Dantaron, the
Aragol river flows steadily onward, a great deal muddier and generally more
polluted for its passage past the docks of Var Bandor to the southwest.  The
city itself looms large beyond the docks, its high stone walls commanding an
excellent view of the surrounding countryside.  North of here, a small
promontory of land overlooks the curve in the river, while the large green
ferrymaster\@s building stands on the east bank, preventing landfall in that
direction.

The Ferryman\@s Saloon~
This is something of a waiting room-cum-saloon, a place where barge
pilots and ferry captains can relax, eat and drink while they await their
rostered departure time.  A large L-shaped bar occupies the northeast
corner, made of dark red teak and covered with all manner of scrawlings and
etchings -- a testament to the innumerable number of patrons that have sat
behind it over the years.  A number of tables and chairs are likewise strewn
about the room, none of them quite matching each other in make or materials,
but all never the less sharing at least one common trait -- sturdiness of
construction.  Various smells emanating from the door to the east indicate
the direction of the kitchen, while a large hand-painted sign hangs over the
door to the north.  The door to the south leads out into the bustle of the
jetty.

The Saloon Kitchen~
Servicing the varied and irregular dietary habits of its nomadic
customers, this kitchen places emphasis on rapid output above any more
sophisticated considerations.  The huge wood-fire oven occupying the east
wall is a testament to this intent, as is the massive central chopping table
-- scored by countless sharp knives.  Along the south wall, a number of
barrels filled with water serve as a place to rinse both food and crockery.

This room serves as the ferrymaster\@s office and dispatch.  A number of
shelves line the north wall, stacked with all manner of records relating to
the transport of goods up and down the rivers.  In front of the shelves, a
large oaken desk acts as the ferrymaster\@s base of operations -- strewn with
paperwork and half-eaten plates of snacks.  A large chair of red leather
completes the ensemble, looking very comfortable and well used.  On the west
wall, a large bulletin board displays the rosters and timetables of various
craft and their captains for the day ahead.  A soft murmur issues from the
saloon to the south, while the door to the east appears to lead to the
ferrymaster\@s private chambers.

The Ferrymaster\@s Quarters~
This is where the ferrymaster makes his home during his infrequent
moments of privacy.  The room is simple, almost bare in fact, since the
ferrymaster eats and works elsewhere.  A cot nestles up against the east
wall, a small kerosene lamp hanging from a hook in the wall above it.  A
similar lamp hangs above a battered looking workbench, which leans against
the south wall.  The centerpiece of the bench is a magnificent model ship,
complete with sails and rigging, surrounded by all manner of model making
tools and glues.  A door in the west wall leads back to the ferrymaster\@s
office.

This field serves as a small grazing paddock for the horses kept in the
stables of the Merchant\@s Belly Inn for longer than a day or two.  The grass
looks fairly well nibbled down -- an good indication of how busy the inn is
pretty much the whole year \@round.  The green wall of the ferrymaster\@s
building borders the paddock on the west, while a high, whitewashed stone
wall protects a vegetable garden to the north.  The stable itself lies east

frying and roasting on the other.  Two large preparation tables occupy the
center of the room -- one for meat and one for vegetables, while along the
south wall, a number of barrels filled with water make a ready place to
rinse both food and crockery.  A small staircase beside the fireplace leads
up to the private dining room, at the foot of which, a small trapdoor
disappears down into the larder.  In the west wall, a sturdy door opens out

arrangement insures a constant baseline level of hubbub here any time of the

outskirts of the room, catering to the more privacy-loving patrons.  The bar
itself stands in front of the west wall, likewise running the length of the

of similar proportions serves as decoration, simultaneously managing to

Designed to make an impression, the foyer of the Merchant\@s Belly is a
splendid sight for the connoisseur of fine woodcraft.  The sweet-smelling
dark teak paneling is festooned with scores of very intricate etchings,
depicting various farming activities as well as the occasional river scene. 
The oaken ceiling is likewise decorated -- here however, raised wooden
frescoes of various floral patterns take the place of the vignettes on the

never the less beautiful woodcut.  The drone of voices emanating from beyond
an ornate oak-bound door in the west wall indicates the direction of the

The Private Dining Room~
Part of the master guest suite, this elegant dining room is reserved for
those guests of the Inn who prefer not to take their meals in the common bar
on the floor below.  The centerpiece is a large mahogany dining table,
beautifully finished and complete with seating for up to eight people.  At
the north end of the room, a moderately sized fireplace is built into the
inn\@s main chimney stack and always kept well tended to insure a comfortable
environment in the surrounding rooms.  Beside the fireplace, a small door
leads down a flight of stairs and into the kitchen, while the hallway lies
eastward, through a lavish door of oak trimmed with mahogany.  A similar
door in the south wall serves as the entrance to the master guestroom.

The Master Guestroom~
This room is the crowning glory of the Merchant\@s Belly Inn, and goes a
long way towards single-handedly maintaining its reputation as the most
luxurious place to stay in the whole of Lithling Valley.  The paneling is
pure mahogany, trimmed with lighter colored pine and decorated with a number
of very life-like frescoes of the local fauna.  A huge four-poster canopy
bed stands against the south wall, made up with silken sheets and draped in
a layer of light gossamer.  Beside it, a beautiful marble washbasin is kept
brimming with cool, fresh water.  Against the west wall, a large writing
desk stands ready with all manner of appropriate implements arrayed upon it,
while across the room, an ornate pine cupboard is available for the more
long-term visitor.  A massive bearskin rug lies on the floor at the foot of
the bed, its shaggy coat looking remarkably clean for something that has
presumably been lying there a few years.  A lavish door of oak trimmed with
mahogany leads out north into the private dining room.

The Lithling Road~
The Lithling road runs north-south here, linking the heartland of the
valley to the south with the distant bridge to the north and the Arien road
beyond it.  The surface of the road is mainly hard-packed mud indented by
the deep groves of cart tracks and occasionally sprinkled with some gravel. 
East of here, golden fields of wheat sway gentle in the breeze, while a thin
trail breaks off from the road and meanders west into a secluded grove of
trees.  The road itself continues north and south.

Golden wheat sways gently in the breeze all around you, the crop growing
tall and strong under the farmer\@s expert eye.  The soil here is still moist
enough not to require too many irrigation ditches, but there are a few here
and there, dealing with the trouble-spots.  The Lithling road lies west of
here, while to the north, the wheat gives way to orderly rows of rustling
corn.  The field is bordered by the sides of a farmhouse and a barn, to the

crammed against all but the east wall and a small woodfire stove in the

heat.  Two tables littered with unwashed plates seem to provide the only
eating area, the occasional missing chair replaced with an old bale of hay.

has been attached to provide the heat.  The top of the heating chamber is
carefully tapered and slanted to catch as much of the condensing run off as
possible.  A small tap has been attached to a point about two thirds of the
way up the boiling chamber, so as to tap the distilled brew.  The tap can be
opened and closed to allow access to the drink.

A Sheep Paddock~
This lush field is set aside for sheep to graze on and live in, a fact
attested to by the innumerable wisps of downy, white fleece that litter the
paddock.  A large oak tree grows in the very center of the field, beneath
which stands a trough, filled with water.  The entrance to a large barn
gapes to the east, while the shearing shed lies north.  To the west, the
side entrance to a large farmhouse beckons, while the gate to the south
opens out onto Delthin Road.

A Field of Barley~
Hissing softly in the gentle breeze a healthy crop of green barley grows
tall and strong in this slightly dryer ground.  Similar to wheat in its
requirements, the barley thrives on the little extra moisture that the
farmers deliver to it via a number of small irrigation ditches, spaced
evenly about the field.  The field of barley continues east, while north of
here it gives way to orderly rows of rustling corn.  Passage west and south
is blocked by the rear of some stockyards.

The Aragol River~
Perhaps the busiest single section of the Aragol river, these muddy
waters lie directly between the northern end of the Var Bandor docks to the
west and the Lithling Jetty to the east.  A thousand smells hang in the air,
as the odor of the river itself mingles with the pungent musk of the city
and the fresh country breeze.  The distant yelling of merchants and
dockworkers rolls gently across the river, fading into the soft chirping of
insects on the opposite bank.  The river here flows in from the south and
down north towards the distant Dantaron.

The Lithling Jetty~
Lying opposite the northern end of the Var Bandor docks, this jetty is
one of the central points of activity for the bargemen of the Aragol and
Dantaron rivers.  A number of barges wait out on the river, since only two
can approach the jetty at any one time to be loaded.  Likewise, carts and
wagons laden with all manner of produce from the valley stand ready,
awaiting their intended floating recipient.  To the north, the large squat
ferrymaster\@s building serves as a job rostering center cum-saloon --
painted a cheery green for a reason now long forgotten.  The anchor above
the oak door of the massive building to the south denotes it as the
shipwright, who relocated to this side of the bank a few generations ago to
provide his dry-docks unobstructed access to the river.  Eastward, the
planking of the jetty gives way to the loosely graveled Var Bandor road,
heading off towards the central crossroads of West Lithling Valley.

A Roadside Shrine~
This small shrine has been built to the side of the road as a place where
travelers may stop and offer up prayers and donations for a safe and speedy
journey.  The design of the structure does not conform to any of the major
religions of Avendar, rather it is a blend of folklore and local
superstitions, dating as far back as the War of Fire, during which times
these lands suffered terribly.  It is hard to tell if the shrine itself is
that old, but it may well be.  A field lies fallow to the north, while
Delthin Road can be seen not far west of here.  The East Lithling crossroads
lies directly south of here -- well nigh on the geographical center of the
whole Lithling Valley, while a green lush-looking glen stretches lies off to
the east.

A simple cairn of ancient stones and petrified wood, fastened together

houses beautiful flowering ivy.  The \@altar\@ of the cairn is fashioned into
the crude likeness of a great winged dragon, nursing a clutch of young. 
There is a sense of peace to the place, an almost palpable aura of renewal.

This rather lavish room serves as the shipwrights office and reception
area.  The sturdy oak walls are lined with a number of paintings depicting
riverside life along the Aragol and Dantaron, as well as some picturesque
Lithling landscapes.  Two large tables form an L-shaped work area in the
southwest corner -- one a large flat desk for legal paperwork, while the
other a slanted drawing table for blueprints.  Several squat filing cabinets
line the east wall, a storage place for copies of the title deeds of most
local shipping.  Two layers of shelves, ringing the room just below the
ceiling, are scattered with small models of various seagoing vessels.  A
large oaken door opens out north onto the Lithling jetty, while a slightly
smaller door of similar make along the south wall leads on into the
dry-docks.  An ornately carved door in the east wall is marked with a
prominent sign.

The Shipwright\@s Home~
This small room is where the shipwright sleeps and goes to seek a little
privacy.  A comfortable looking bed nestles in the southeast corner, well
supplied with pillows and soft-looking sheets.  A small writing desk in the
northeast corner and a large wardrobe against the east wall make up the
remainder of the furniture.  The floor is covered with a large, shag-pile
rug made out of dark reddish-looking fur.  An ornately carved door in the
west wall leads out into the office.

The Dry-Dock~
This huge chamber is a repair and maintenance area for the ferries and
barges which regularly ply the trade routes of the Aragol and Dantaron
rivers.  A slanted ramp angles up from the reinforced double-doors in the
west wall, wooden rollers placed cunningly across it to ease the strain on
the massive winch at the top of the eastern-most end.  A complicated
arrangement of scaffolding surrounds the ramp, ready to provide easy access
to any area of a vessel that is winched up into dry-dock.  A small oaken
door leads north into the office, while a similar portal, reinforced with
metal bands, guards the tool room to the east.  Through the double doors at
the western end of the ramp the Aragol river can be heard sloshing gently
against the side of the building, the dry-dock itself however, continues
south.

well-worn handles to allow the craft to be raised manually, and an iron
locking mechanism to keep the ship from sliding back once it is in place.

The ramp is made of solid oak and reinforced with wooden struts.  It is

The shipwright appears to use this room as an over-sized version of a

invariably left over after major repairs, in case they are needed to
jury-rig something for his next client.  The long-term confinement of
numerous large pieces of damp wood in an enclosed and poorly ventilated
space is what is responsible for the somewhat fetid odor which pervades this
area.  A small oaken door in the west wall leads out into the dry-dock.

In a Wheat Field~
Golden wheat sways gently in the breeze all around you, the crop growing
tall and strong under the farmer\@s expert eye.  The soil here is still moist
enough not to require too many irrigation ditches, but there are a few here
and there, dealing with the trouble-spots.  The soil gets progressively
moister to the south, eventually giving way to intricately tiered layers of
rice paddies, while eastward the wheat gives way to orderly rows of rustling
corn.  To the west, the Aragol river begins its journey between the docks of
Var Bandor and the hulking mass of the shipwrights building to the north.

Beryil road passes by a short ways to the east -- headed for its village
namesake, some distance southeast of here.  To the north, the rear of the

This well-traveled, mud-packed path runs between Var Bandor road
immediately to the north and the distant village of Beryil to the south.  A

numerous cart-tracks have left a more than ample route to follow.  An
orderly field of rustling corn lies to the south, while the side of the huge
shipwrights building looms westward.

Making good use of the nearby Lithling Lake via some cunning irrigation
ditches running under the road, farmers have covered these fields with an
intricate network of tiered layers of rice paddies.  Thin trails criss-cross
the area, providing excellent access to every conceivable nook and cranny. 
The side of a large barn pens the paddies in from the north, while Lithling
road serves as the eastern border.  The welcoming doorway of a farmhouse
lies to the south and as the ground grows firmer to the west, the paddies
are replaced by a field of tall sugar-cane exhuding a pungent, syrupy aroma.

They look quite spacious and comfortable despite their rudimentary
qualities.

The Lithling Road~
Running north-south along the west bank of the lake, this section of
Lithling road connects its namesake village to the south with the West
Lithling Crossroads, immediately north of here.  The surface of the road is
mainly hard-packed mud indented by the deep groves of cart tracks and
occasionally sprinkled with some gravel.  The lake lies directly to the
east, a soft mist perpetually wafting across it\@s calm blue surface.  To the
west, orderly rows of corn rustle softly in the breeze.

The Lithling Road~
This section of Lithling road connects its namesake village to the
southeast with the West Lithling Crossroads, a way north of here.  The
surface of the road is mainly hard-packed mud indented by the deep groves of

On Lake Lithling~
The crystal blue waters of the lake ripple gently all around you as the
soft, playful breezes of the valley cavort across its mirror-like surface. 
Thin wisps of mist roll back and forth, constantly condensing above the
water as the cool air of the valley comes into contact with the warm vapors
of the lake -- heated by some deep underwater geyser.  Delthin Road to the
north, and Lithling road to the west border this quiet corner, while the
lake itself extends east and south.

A Curve in Delthin Road~
This section of the Delthin Road dips away slightly from the wet banks of
Lake Lithling, which lie to the west and south.  This, as well as the
generous amount of gravel which heralds the proximity of a crossroads to the
east goes far towards increasing the quality of the road as compared to its
infamous muddy stretch between here and the West Lithling Crossroads cast
\@invis\@ the far distance.  The lake itself lies directly to the south and
west, a soft mist perpetually wafting across it\@s calm blue surface. 
Delthin road heads north into what can only be described as a lot of mud,
and east to a well-graveled crossroads.

The East Lithling Crossroads~
Not technically a crossroads, but called such by the locals out of a
sense of symmetry, this T-junction is the meeting place of Delthin and West
Forest Roads.  Looming up out of the eastern valley, Lithling Forest
suddenly dominates the eastern landscape, providing a fitting counterpart to
the beautiful lake to the west.  Delthin road runs east towards its village
namesake, and west along the northern edge of the lake, while West Forest
road -- little more than a dirt track in actual fact -- meanders south,
between the western edge of Lithling Forest and the lake.  A little way
north of this intersection, a small roadside shrine can be made out through
the foliage.  A large signpost stands off to one side, pointing in various
directions.

Although the ground here is very fertile -- perhaps the most fertile in

seems to be a serenity about this place that appears impervious to bustle of
work and commerce that permeates the valley around it.  Lithling Road lies

The plaque is adorned with an etching of startling intricacy and beauty. 
The scene is a landscape, a view of the lake from this very place it seems. 
There are some subtle differences in the background however, the thin line
of the road along the north shore is missing, as are the numerous fields and
farmhouses beyond it.  The central focus of the etching, is not on the lake
however, but above it.  A creature is hurtling down towards the heart of the
water, the shearing air in the image indicating its\@ thunderous speed.  Its\@
form is somewhat drake-like, but if the wingspan is true to scale with the
rest of the scene it would have to be nothing less than a True Dragon, and a
fully grown one at that.  The final detail: the small, backwards sloping
curved horns upon the head, indicate that the creature is female.  Below the
image there is, what appears to be a title: \#The Decent of Shyela-Kyra.\#

The South Bank of Lake Lithling~
Although the ground here is very fertile -- perhaps the most fertile in
the entire valley -- the south bank of the lake has been devoted exclusively
to all manner of flowers, both wild and cultivated.  Despite the proximity
of the bustling village of Lithling, immediately to the southwest, there
seems to be a serenity about this place that appears impervious to bustle of
work and commerce that permeates the valley around it.  The south bank
continues west, while the lake lies to the north.  The turbulent mouth of
the Lithling River lies to the east, and the garden continues along what is
technically that rivers west bank.  A small tower rises up from the
northeast corner of the Lithling stockade, directly southwest of here,
overlooking the garden and the river mouth.

flowers~
The flowerbed is a dazzling collage of colors and odors, an impossible
mix considering the widely varied seasonallity and conditions that many of
the specimens are associated with.  It would be reasonable to assume that
some kind of extraordinary agency is responsible for this amazing bloom.

The Mouth of the Lithling River~
The short life of the Lithling River comes to a turbulent end here as the
work of the tributaries finally culminates with their expulsion into the
depths of Lake Lithling.  A few sizable rocks jut out here and there -- the
proverbial teeth of the mouth -- making this stretch of water somewhat
treacherous to navigate.  The Lithling river flows in from the south and out
into the lake to the north.  The Forest broods darkly beyond West Forest
Road, to the east of here, while the south bank of the lake lies westward.

West Forest Road~
Called a road to encourage travelers, but in actual fact little more than
a dirt track, with the mere beginnings of the tell-tale grooves of cart
tracks, West Forest Road meanders in between the Forest and the lake -- as
picturesque as it is uneven.  Encouraged by the citizens of Lithling Village
as a detour around the often flooded stretch of Delthin road that runs along
the north of the lake, it also serves to bring extra visitors through the
village -- always a good thing for people with goods to sell.  The road
continues south and reaches a crossroads to the north.  The lake lies west,
while the brooding bulk of the forest stretches off to the east.

The Aragol River~
The Aragol River curves in from the west here and flows on northward,
past the looming bulk of Var Bandor to the northwest.  The fresh, bluish
water slows down going around this bend, as the river widens and deepens. 
An intricate design of layered rice paddies cover the east bank, making good
use of the plentiful mineral-rich water supply, while a grove of beautiful
sleepy willows grace the south bank -- gently caressing the water.

A Small Grove of Willows~
Thriving in the saturated, mineral-rich soil adjacent to the Aragol
River, a small grove of willows has taken root and flourished on this bank. 
A gentle wind blows in from the river, caressing the slight leaves and
producing a rustling that sounds almost like a whisper just beyond the range
of hearing.  Every once in a while you can hear a soft plop, as a fish tries
to nibble at one of the low hanging leaves which tickle the surface of the
river.  The willows thin out southward as the riverbank continues in that
direction.  To the east, a lush green field of barley rustles quietly, while
the river itself lies north and west.

The East Bank of the Aragol River~
This riverbank is quite rocky and broken -- quite unsuitable for any kind
of organized agriculture.  To the west, the Aragol river flows swift and
strong, rushing down towards its immanent rendezvous with the city of Var
Bandor of to the northwest.  A variety of vegetation thrives here however,
drawing on moisture which would be beyond the reach of less hardy root
systems.  A small homestead stands to the south, planks nailed across its
shutters and numerous slats in its roof cracked or broken -- it bears the
unmistakable signs of abandonment.  To the east, the ground flattens out and
clears up quite quickly, giving way to a modest plantation of cotton, while
a small grove of willow trees lies northward.

An Abandoned Homestead~
This small house smells musty, choked with the dust and cobwebs of
disuse.  What furniture there may once have been now lies shattered and
unrecognizable, strewn about the house haphazardly and -- judging by the
numerous dents in the walls -- with great force.  Large patches of seared
wood are visible on the floor, walls and ceiling, as if a mighty fire once
raged here -- although curiously, the rest of the structure does not seem to
have been damaged.  An oaken door it the north wall leads outside, there
appears to have once been a door leading south, although it looks to have
been firmly nailed shut and painted over a long time ago.

A Thin Trail Through Rice Paddies~
Making good use of the steep and wet slope down to the Aragol River to
the west, farmers have covered these fields with an intricate network of
tiered layers of rice paddies.  Thin trails criss-cross the area, providing
excellent access to every conceivable nook and cranny.  North and east,
golden fields of wheat grow in abundance on the more level ground, while a
lush green field of barley rustles quietly to the south.

A Field of Barley~
Hissing softly in the gentle breeze a healthy crop of green barley grows
tall and strong in this slightly dryer ground.  Similar to wheat in its
requirements, the barley thrives on the little extra moisture that the
farmers deliver to it via a number of small irrigation ditches, spaced
evenly about the field.  As the ground get moister to the north, intricately
tiered layers of rice paddies take over from the barley, while to the east,
a vast field of tall corn rustles softly in the breeze.  Southward --
shinning an almost luminous white -- a small plantation of cotton thrives in
the fertile soil, while a cool-looking grove of willows whispers quietly of
to the west.

Shinning white with an almost radiant luminosity, this young cotton
plantation is thriving in soil made fertile by the nearby Aragol River.  As

cotton fiber and carries them on a merry little dance through the air above
-- a whole swarm of tiny white clouds that dip and dive like larks on the
air currents.  The cotton plantation continues east, while a lush green
field of barley rustles quietly to the north.  To the west, the ground
becomes somewhat more rocky as it approaches the river, and progress
southward is blocked by the side of a small farmhouse.

heat.  Two tables littered with unwashed plates seem to provide the only

rice paddies, while northward the wheat gives way to orderly rows of
rustling corn.  The Beryil Road borders the field to the east, while the

The North Gates of Beryil~
The Beryil Road terminates here in a solid looking stockade.  The main
materials appear to be crudely finished trunks of pine, cemented together
with hard-setting resin and lashed with thick cord for extra support.  The
wall varies slightly in height, from twelve to about fifteen feet in some
places, terminating in pointed wooden spikes.  The gates themselves are
slightly shorter -- perhaps eight feet high -- made in a similar fashion,
but also reinforced with two thick horizontal bands of steel across their
lower and upper portions.  A small booth stands to one side of the gate, a
place for the toll-collectors to rest their feet from their busy duties. 
The Beryil Road continues north, and disappears southward into the village. 
To the west -- shinning an almost luminous white -- a small plantation of
cotton thrives in the fertile soil, while passage east is blocked by the
rear of a large shed.

and there, dealing with the trouble-spots.  The southern edge of the field
is bordered by the stockade of Beryil, while a small shed lies just west of
here through a large door.  Cornfields grow to the north and east --
rustling quietly in the gentle breeze.

A Storage Shed~
This large musty barn serves as a storehouse for crops harvested from the
surrounding fields.  It is piled high with all manner of produce, packed
into sacks and ready for transport to various destinations in Avendar.  The
floor is covered with a thick layer of straw and the roof seems well
insulated from the weather, protecting the farmer\@s valuable investment. 
Large doors in the south wall lead out into a fallow field.

A Fallow Field~
This field is unused, lying fallow so it can recover enough minerals and
nutrients to once again support a healthy harvest.  The entrance of a large
shed looms northward, while to the east, a small copse of trees leads into a
peaceful glade.  The fields to the south and west are devoted to corn crop,
their produce softly rustling in the slight breeze.

In a Corn Field~
This field is devoted to corn crop.  Plowed and planted in orderly rows,
the corn is growing strong and healthy -- a testament to the skill and care
displayed by the farming dynasties of this fertile valley.  The field north
of here lies fallow, while westward, beautiful golden wheat grows thick and
strong in the fertile soil.  A small hill rises up above the surrounding
countryside just east of here, while a lush glen lies south.  Directly to
the Southwest, you can make out the impressive stockade of Beryil.

A Lush Glen~
This quiet meadow seems to have been left to its own devices -- proof
that not every square foot of the Lithling valley is being milked for every
crown it is worth by the canny inhabitants.  The grass here is lush and
green, thick with moisture and vitality and sprinkled with a variety of wild
flowers.  There are no trees as such, but short shrubs abound, providing
ample cover for the variety of small animals that make this place their
home.  The impressive stockade of Beryil looms to the west, bordering the
glen on that side -- indeed the east gate itself can be made out not far to
the south.  The glen continues east, while a vast field of tall corn
announces the beginning of farmlands to the north.  Directly northeast of
here, a small hill rises up above the surrounding countryside.

The East Gates of Beryil~
Rivers Road terminates here in a solid looking stockade.  The main
materials appear to be crudely finished trunks of pine, cemented together
with hard-setting resin and lashed with thick cord for extra support.  The
wall varies slightly in height, from twelve to about fifteen feet in some
places, terminating in pointed wooden spikes.  The gates themselves are
slightly shorter -- perhaps eight feet high -- made in a similar fashion,
but also reinforced with two thick horizontal bands of steel across their
lower and upper portions.  A small booth stands to one side of the gate, a
place for the toll-collectors to rest their feet from their busy duties. 
Rivers Road continues east, and disappears westward into the village.  A
lush looking glen lies north of here, while passage south is blocked by the
rear of a small cabin.

The Lithling Road~
This section of Lithling road connects its namesake village to the east
with the West Lithling Crossroads a good distance north of here.  The
surface of the road is mainly hard-packed mud indented by the deep groves of
cart tracks and occasionally sprinkled with some gravel.  A peaceful looking
glen lies southward, while the side of a large shed impedes further progress
west.  The road itself proceeds north and east, where it arrives at the west
gates of Lithling.

The Summit of a Small Hill~
Looking out over a vast area of the lush Lithling valley, the summit of
this modest hill affords an excellent view of the surrounding countryside. 
Gentle columns of smoke waft upward from the west and east, emanating from
the kitchens and furnaces of the villages of Beryil and Lithling, while far
to the northeast, similar plumes in the distance indicate the general
direction of Delthin.  The country north of here is predominantly farmland
-- crisscrossed by roads and doted with various functional structures and
the occasional farmhouse.  From the south, numerous creeks and brooks find
their way into the valley both overland and under ground, flowing down into
the short-lived Lithling River, and emptying into Lake Lithling to the
northeast.  Beyond the wetlands and foothills to the south, the Saerin
Ranges loom dark and menacing over the valley, their white-topped peeks
staring gloomily across at the vast forest of Lithling, far to the east.  A
narrow trail winds its way down, to the foot of the hill.

Herbalists Cottage~
This modest little cottage seems to be more a laboratory than a home. 
The small cot tucked away in the northwest corner looks to be almost an
afterthought, compared to the vast worktable occupying the center of the
room and the extensive shelving which fills every spare foot of wall space. 
To attempt to describe the odor of this residence is an opus in itself,
however once smell after smell have assaulted the senses for a few moments,
all that is left of a coherent impression is the sense of acrid.  The
shelves seem stacked with all manner of receptacles, housing a horde of
various herbs, ointments, unguents, poultices and less readily nameable
concoctions, indispersed with the occasional book or worn notepad.  Upon the
heavily scorched worktable, a large brazier burns erratically, flanked by a
mortar and pestle, and surrounded by several pots containing
works-in-progress.  A small door in the south wall leads out onto Rivers
Road.

Running swiftly down from the Saerin Ranges, this small tributary is
flowing in to meet its brethren and form the short-lived Lithling River,
which feeds the deep waters of Lake Lithling itself.  As the ground levels
out here, the water begins to flow slightly slower but wider, starting to
resemble more and more the river it is about to become.  The tributary flows

The West Bank of the Lithling River~
Although the ground here is very fertile -- perhaps the most fertile in
the entire valley -- the west bank of the river has been devoted exclusively
to all manner of flowers, both wild and cultivated.  Despite the proximity
of the bustling village of Lithling, immediately to the west, there seems to
be a serenity about this place that appears impervious to hum of work and
commerce that permeates the valley around it.  The turbulent Lithling River
lies to the east, and the garden continues north, towards the south bank of
the lake.  The large stockade of Lithling curves around the edge of the
village to the northwest, and continues on south, where it meets the east
gate of the village.

The Lithling River~
The Lithling River flows on swift and strong here, rapidly approaching
its terminus at Lake Lithling to the north.  This section of the river is
wide and deep, the strong currents making for a treacherous crossing.  The
river flows in from the south, passing under a large wooden bridge, and
continues on northward, emptying into the mouth of the lake.  A dark forest
looms beyond West Forest Road, to the east of here, while the stockade of
Lithling village lies west, beyond the riverbank.

West Forest Road~
Called a road to encourage travelers, but in actual fact little more than
a dirt track, with the mere beginnings of the tell-tale grooves of cart
tracks, West Forest Road meanders in between the forest and the river -- as
picturesque as it is uneven.  Encouraged by the citizens of Lithling Village
as a detour around the often flooded stretch of Delthin road that runs along
the north of the lake, it also serves to bring extra visitors through the
village -- always a good thing for people with goods to sell.  The road
continues north and south, while the turbulent Lithling River lies to the
west and the brooding bulk of the forest stretches of to the east.

The East Gates of Lithling~
West Forest Road terminates here in a solid looking stockade.  The main
materials appear to be crudely finished trunks of pine, cemented together
with hard-setting resin and lashed with thick cord for extra support.  The
wall varies slightly in height, from twelve to about fifteen feet in some
places, terminating in pointed wooden spikes.  The gates themselves are
slightly shorter -- perhaps eight feet high -- made in a similar fashion,
but also reinforced with two thick horizontal bands of steel across their
lower and upper portions.  A small booth stands to one side of the gate, a
place for the toll-collectors to rest their feet from their busy duties. 
West Forest Road continues east across a large wooden bridge, and disappears
westward into the village, while the west bank of the Lithling River lies
north and south.

West Forest Bridge~
Spanning across the turbulent Lithling River, this sturdy wooden bridge
looks to have stood the test of time.  Made of dark hard pine, and
reinforced with oak -- the railings on either side are decorated with
detailed bas-relief carvings dating back centuries.  Below, the turbulent
Lithling River races past towards its rendezvous with the vast lake to the
north.  Off to the west, gentle columns of smoke rise up beyond the imposing
stockade of Lithling village, whose east gates lie a short way past the
bridge in that direction.  Of to the east, West Forest Road curves away to
the north, following the borders of the looming hulk of Lithling Forest.

the day for the eyeless.

Beneath a Bridge on Lithling River~
The turbulent Lithling River narrows here as it flows under a large
wooden bridge.  The structure looks old, but well looked-after -- its
underside kept clean and free from mould.  The river itself speeds up as it
is squeezed through this narrower section, bubbling and swirling its way
downstream, towards the distant lake.  Flowing in from the south, the river
continues on north beyond the bridge, which also prevents landfall to the
east or west.

West Bank of the Lithling River~
This built-up embankment overlooks the turbulent Lithling River, flowing
from south to north a short distance east of here.  The grass here is lush
and green, thick with moisture and vitality and sprinkled with a variety of
wild flowers.  There are no trees as such, but short shrubs abound,
providing ample cover for the variety of small animals that make this place
their home.  A smaller body of water -- a tributary of the river -- flows
past just south of here, soon to join with the river proper.  The embankment
flattens out into a lush glen to the west, while the east gates of the
village of Lithling can be seen not far to the north.

Tributary of the Lithling River~
Running swiftly down from the Saerin Ranges, this small tributary is
flowing in to meet its brethren and form the short-lived Lithling River,
which feeds the deep waters of Lake Lithling itself.  As the ground levels
out here, the water begins to flow slightly slower but wider, starting to
resemble more and more the river it is about to become.  The tributary flows

The Lithling River~
Although it is a matter of some contention, this area is widely
recognized as being the official beginning of the Lithling River.  The
various tributaries converge here, gathering momentum as the river forges
on.  An abundance of underwater rocks make this area quite deceptive and
treacherous, the foaming white water swirling in angry little pools. 
Smaller tributaries flow in from the east, south and west, forming the
beginning of this powerful torrent, while the river itself flows on
northward.

The Foyer of an Old Manor~
This rather old fashioned foyer is decorated with heavy, fur-lined
hanging rugs and finished in faded mahogany.  The old oak, which comprises
the foundation of the building, looks a little pitted and smells somewhat
damp -- not enough to detract from the elegance of the chamber, but
sufficient to hint at gradual decay.  A large rack stands off in the
southeast corner, presumably a place to hang cloaks and so forth.  Against
the east wall, a gently curving staircase leads up to the second floor of
the house -- its finely carved handrails finished in polished bone.  To the
north, a stately door leads into the main sitting room, while reinforced
oaken double-doors lead south, into the garden.

A Stately Sitting Room~
This comfortable room serves as the main area for relaxing and
socializing within the manor.  A large fireplace is built into the west
wall, the stones on either side delicately engraved with strange faces of
indeterminate race.  Next to the fireplace -- in the northwest corner -- a
spiral staircase of finely cut stone leads down to the wine cellar.  The
east and south wall, either side of the doors, are devoted to shelves
housing the manors impressive library.  A number of armchairs and sofas are
scattered about the room, providing ample places of comfort to enjoy the
literary collection.  The entire north wall is devoted to a huge tapestry,
depicting an ancestral story of courage dating back to the War of Fire. 
Above the fireplace, on the west wall, hangs a large portrait of a handsome
young man.  A stately door in the south wall leads out into the foyer, the
dining room lies through an ornate door to the east.

E
tapestry~
The tapestry is undoubtedly a masterpiece, woven so fine as to be
virtually indistinguishable from an oil painting in depth of detail, at
anything beyond a half dozen feet, and yet possessing a certain distinct
aspect of texture that sets it apart.  The story takes place during the War
of Fire and seems to be about a young knight -- presumably a former lord or
eldest son of the house -- who rallies the scattered forces of the valley
and leads a counterattack against the marauding Srynn war bands and their
human allies.  The battle seems poised, but at the crucial moment a terror
of red scales and flame -- a True Dragon, allied with the Srynn -- joins the
fray and strikes down the brave knight, scattering his forces.  The final
scene shows the knights\@ banner, scorched and torn, flying over the town of
Lithling -- the only place in the valley not sacked during the war: the man
dead, but the spirit immortal.

E
books~
The bookshelves appear stocked with all manner of literature, but it is

There are old tales and proverbs, treatise on military tactics and campaign

wars and the politics that surrounded them -- a great deal of the history of
conflict in Avendar seems to be distilled on these brimming shelves.  Above
the books there appears to be a little compartment for scrolls and similar
parchment.

A Sumptuous Dining Room~
Reeking of wealth and elegance, this dining room would be the envy of any
aspiring socialite.  The walls are paneled in teak and finished with dark
mahogany, carved with engrossing spiral designs.  The centerpiece of course
is the massive table, dominating the middle of the room and boasting ample
seating for twelve diners.  A large drinks cabinet stands against the north
wall, containing a wide assortment of spirits and liqueurs, next to an
ornate teak cupboard, which displays a selection of cutlery and crockery. 
An impressive painting dominates the east wall, an engrossing landscape
depicting Lake Lithling by moonlight.  An ornate door leads west into the
sitting room, while a large oak door in the south wall connects to the
kitchen.

night has been skillfully captured and expressed in the gentle colors and
lines of the image.  The mirrored stillness of the moon and stars on the
surface of the lake seems alive with the quiet sounds and gentle breezes of
the night.  Oddly, the painting appears untitled.

A Well-Appointed Kitchen~
This spacious kitchen looks to be very well equipped and able to prepare
food in a wide variety of ways.  A pair of metal sinks stand against the
south wall, connected to a foot-pump which brings up water from a
subterranean source.  Two oak chopping tables flank the sinks, and a largish
spice-rack occupies the southeast corner.  The west wall is devoted to a
large woodfire oven, and a smaller pair of kerosene-powered hotplates.  A
squat Nefortian kiln stands in the northeast corner, used for baking the
sweat bread for which its\@ people are famous, while the center of the room
is occupied by an ornate cooking brazier, distinctively Shuddeni in design. 
A large oaken door in the north wall leads out into the dining room.

This brazier is made of cast iron, the distinctive Shuddeni style
resulting in numerous sharp hooks and points, both decorative and

curved spikes as the main body of the flame licks up towards the main
cooking platform.  The top of the brazier curves inward, ending in sharp
spikes that turn suddenly up, thus providing perfect roasting conditions for
anything impaled upon them.

resulting in numerous sharp hooks and points, both decorative and
functional.  The brazier is heated from the bottom, the heat passing up the
curved spikes as the main body of the flame licks up towards the main
cooking platform.  The top of the brazier curves inward, ending in sharp
spikes that turn suddenly up, thus providing perfect roasting conditions for
anything impaled upon them.

nefortian~
This large squat kiln is made out of dark red clay commonly associated
with the caverns of the Nefortu.  The interior is shaped very distinctively,
designed to circulate the air in such a way as to produce very light
textured bread.  There is a small cache at the top of the kiln, a small
amount of sugar is placed there, which slowly melts and gets circulated by
the air currents, giving the bread a distinctive sweet and light taste.

The Garden of an Old Manor~
Set back a way from the Nendor Road, this impressive property appears to
be in a state of disrepair, bordering on neglect.  The surrounding garden
looks to have gone wild some time ago and, while not choked with weeds yet,
is beginning to show the signs of unmonitored growth.  The house itself,
whose imposing bulk looms large to the north, is a little better managed,
but is also demonstrating the same symptoms.  A shutter rattling on its
hinges here, a handful of missing shingles there -- all point towards an old
family on the decline.  The thin path running through the garden leads north
through the front door of the house, and south through an old iron gate onto
Nendor Road.

A Dim Hallway~
This rather dark hallway connects the rooms of the manors second story. 
There are small kerosene lamps at regular intervals along the west wall,
however they are kept burning very low and cast only a nominal amount of
light.  The oak here is paneled with very old-looking dark pine, in certain
places in fact, the paneling looks like it has been rather inexpertly
repaired.  The hallway continues north, while a baroque looking door leads
east into a bedroom.  Against the south wall, a gently curving staircase
leads down to the first floor of the house -- its finely carved handrails
finished in polished bone.

A Guest Bedroom~
This disused bedroom is nominally intended to serve as a guestroom for
the infrequent visitor.  Judging by the state of disuse, and the mustiness
of the linen however, guests seem to prefer the deep and comfortable couches
downstairs.  Matters are not aided by the fact that a few crates have crept
in here and now lurk in the southwest corner, marking the beginning of what
will no doubt be a transformation into a storeroom.  The old bed itself
stands against the south wall, and looks comfortable enough, if it were not
for its forlorn surroundings.  A small basin and a wash-mirror comprise the
only other furnishings of the chamber.  A baroque looking door leads west,

This room appears well lived-in and comfortably furnished.  A large,

mahogany dressing tables, and expansive built-in closets line the north and
south walls.  The floor is covered by a shaggy plush-pile carpet, dark brown
in color, which exhudes a lingering musty smell.  A huge mirror hangs upon
the north wall, some four feet high and as long as the room itself.  A

Situated at the rear of the second story, this cozy study occupies the
perfect place of seclusion in the manor.  A large desk of polished oak
commands the northern portion of the room, behind which stands a
comfortable-looking armchair of dark red leather.  A low settee of the same
material is pushed up against the east wall, while the west wall is covered
by a huge set of shelves, devoted to a multitude of books.  An impressive
painting in an ornate frame hangs behind the desk on the north wall,
depicting what appears to be the Lithling Valley as viewed from the south --
perhaps from atop the Saerin Ranges.  To the south, a large door of deep red
teak -- reinforced with oak -- leads out into the hallway.

Expertly hewn from the stone upon which the manor is built, this
expansive cellar is a testament to the former wealth of those who
commissioned it.  Rack upon rack of bottles line the walls, and further
racks are spaced in even rows throughout the chamber.  Dust and old cobwebs
lie thick upon everything except the occasional newer looking bottle of wine
-- a clear indication that the cellar is still very much in active service.

Although secluded underground, this dark chamber seems clean and well

with a simple shrine to commemorate the departed.  The shrine itself is
arranged against the north wall, flanked by dimly glowing candelabra that
barely illuminate it.  A small wooden dais stands before it, upon which an
old looking tome lies open.  The east wall of the chamber marks the final
resting-place of family members, ornate golden plaques indicating where the

The dust of centuries lies thick upon this place, indicating that even if

accompanied by a chair stands against the west wall -- plain stout oak,
covered with cobwebs.  The center of the room is occupied by a strange

the grooves.  The south and east walls are dedicated to shelf upon shelf of
books -- all manner in fact, some so mundane as to appear out of place in

wall varies slightly in height, from twelve to about fifteen feet in some
places, terminating in pointed wooden spikes.  The gates themselves are
slightly shorter -- perhaps eight feet high -- made in a similar fashion,
but also reinforced with two thick horizontal bands of steel across their
lower and upper portions.  A small booth stands to one side of the gate, a
place for the toll-collectors to rest their feet from their busy duties. 
Nendor Road continues west, and disappears northward into the village. 
Passage east is blocked by the side of a large log cabin, while a small
trail meanders south, towards the mountains.

Nendor Road~
Little more than a wide track of packed dirt, Nendor Road serves as a
shortcut between the valley of Lithling and the settlements in and beyond
Nendor Forest.  Apart from saving time, this route also serves to save on
the taxes that would otherwise be payable by merchants detouring through Var
Bandor.  The impressive stockade of Beryil looms to the north, while the
south gate itself lies a short way to the east.  Nendor Road continues west,
and a lush green glen lies southward.

This quiet meadow seems to have been left to its own devices -- proof
that not every square foot of the Lithling valley is being milked for every

A Small Trail~
Winding its way towards the distant Saerin Ranges, this well beaten path
shows none of the usual cart tracks and other such signs of a trade route. 
Rather, it seems to be a common trail used by trappers and hunters to reach
the outlying areas of the southern mountains.  The trail continues east and
north, where it approaches the south gates of Beryil.  A lush glen lies
west, while to the south the land slopes gently upward, as foothills rise up

Rocky Foothills~
The terrain here becomes quite rugged, as the ground slopes sharply
upward to meet the approaching Saerin Ranges.  Rocks replace the abundant
vegetation so typical of the valley, and the lack of trees providing cover
results in a marked increase in the amount of cold wind blowing in from the
mountains.  What the area lacks in fertility however, it more than makes up
for in building materials -- the granite which predominates these foothills
looking quite workable, and of exceptional quality.  The foothills continue
east and south, while Nendor Road lies to the north and west.

The mountains loom directly south of here -- great jagged fingers clawing
their way up out of the ground and grasping at the heavens themselves --
their peeks lost in mists and clouds.  Around you, the rocky ground seems
quite broken and scattered, the punishment of countless rockslides and the
occasional avalanche no doubt taking their toll.  Somewhere around this
point, local reckoning determines that the Lithling Valley proper ends,
giving way to the barren sentinels that tower before you.  The rocky ground

A Trapper\@s Cabin~
This somewhat asture log cabin serves as a trappers home and base of
operations.  The furnishings are rather sparse, since trappers tend to spend
most of their time out looking for quarry, only really returning home to
re-supply and spend the odd night sleeping under a roof for a change.  A
rudimentary bed is pushed up against the north wall, looking rather
neglected, and a small meal table is tucked up against the west wall, with
but a solitary chair to accompany it.  A meager wood-fired hotplate,
situated in the center of the cabin both for ease of cooking and for warmth,
completes the inventory of the cabins permanent possessions.  A rough door
in the south wall leads out onto a thin trail.

A Tanning Hut~
The most prominent feature of this large hut is the smell.  Tanneries are
not renowned for their pleasant odor, and here, where utility is a
constraining factor and the complaints of neighbors are not, there has been
no effort at all to try and curb the noxious vapors.  The east side of the
hut reeks of brine-salt.  A number of large hides are laid out to be cured
on a makeshift table there, layered on top of one another and separated by
the foul-smelling paste.  The west side of the hut sports and number of
various, but equally foul odors.  There are several barrels of lime, soaking
the hides in order to loosen the hairs, as well as a huge vat of pungent
tannic acid where yet more hides are slowly undergoing the last stage of the
process.  A rough door in the south wall leads out onto a thin trail.

The table is of sturdy pine construction, but has suffered terribly in

Dense Marshland~
Excessive moisture and saturated topsoil have resulted in an area of
dense marshland among this verdant river delta.  The ground is very wet and
unstable here, riddled with a variety of small, wiry plants of various
types, but devoid of any vegetation larger than a shrub.  A tributary of the
Lithling River curves around the marshy ground to the east and south,

the source of the appalling smell -- the side of a tannery blocks your way
beyond the marshes, while a short way to the north, Rivers Road skirts the
edge of the marshland.

A Small Trail~
Winding its way towards the distant Saerin Ranges, this well beaten path
shows none of the usual cart tracks and other such signs of a trade route. 
Rather, it seems to be a common trail used by trappers and hunters to reach
the outlying areas of the southern mountains.  The trail continues east and
west, while a small tributary of the Lithling River bounces along to the
south.  A large log cabin stands a little way off the road to the north.  A
great many animal hides are arranged around the front of it, presumably
drying outside.  A crude sign is carved into some bark leaning against one
of the pieces of hide.

Saerin Ranges loom large to the south.

The Mouth of a Damp Cave~
The small trail terminates at the mouth of what appears to be a large
damp-looking cave.  The entrance is located in the shoulder of a mountain,
whose vast arm reaches a little way into the valley proper.  The cave mouth
looks well worked on -- not quite a tunnel, but definitely a cave that has
had a lot of attention.  You notice a carving in the rock, out of the rain
but within sight of the entrance.  The ground slopes down to the west,
turning into a small, well-defined trail.

Tributary of the Lithling River~
Running swiftly down from the Saerin Ranges, this small tributary is
flowing in to meet its brethren and form the short-lived Lithling River,
which feeds the deep waters of Lake Lithling itself.  Slowing down as it
emerges from the foothills, the tributary starts to flow more sedately and
to widen as it meanders down into the heart of the valley.  The tributary
flows in from the south and continues on east.  To the north, the ground
looks quite marshy and unstable, while a small trail runs along the bank of
the tributary to the west.

water quickens its pace somewhat, being hemmed in between an outcropping of

Start of the Saerin Ranges~
The mountains loom directly south of here -- great jagged fingers clawing
their way up out of the ground and grasping at the heavens themselves --
their peeks lost in mists and clouds.  Around you, the rocky ground seems
quite broken and scattered, the punishment of countless rockslides and the
occasional avalanche no doubt taking their toll.  Somewhere around this
point, local reckoning determines that the Lithling Valley proper ends,
giving way to the barren sentinels that tower before you.  The rocky ground
continues east and west, while a small tributary of the Lithling River
bubbles along merrily to the north of here.

Tributary of the Lithling River~
Running swiftly down from the Saerin Ranges, this small tributary is
flowing in to meet its brethren and form the short-lived Lithling River,
which feeds the deep waters of Lake Lithling itself.  Fresh from the
mountains, the waters bounce along merrily, their crystal-like depths
seemingly alive with freshness and vitality.  The tributary begins here --
flowing together from innumerable small rivulets and trickles, which
disappear into the mountains.  It continues on north into the valley,
passing between inhospitable looking foothills to the east and west. 
Southward the foothills finally arrive at the beginning of the Saerin Ranges
themselves.

Rocky Foothills~
The terrain here becomes quite rugged, as the ground slopes sharply
upward to meet the approaching Saerin Ranges.  Rocks replace the abundant
vegetation so typical of the valley, and the lack of trees providing cover
results in a marked increase in the amount of cold wind blowing in from the
mountains.  What the area lacks in fertility however, it more than makes up

Start of the Saerin Ranges~
The mountains loom directly south of here -- great jagged fingers clawing
their way up out of the ground and grasping at the heavens themselves --
their peeks lost in mists and clouds.  Around you, the rocky ground seems
quite broken and scattered, the punishment of countless rockslides and the
occasional avalanche no doubt taking their toll.  Somewhere around this
point, local reckoning determines that the Lithling Valley proper ends,
giving way to the barren sentinels that tower before you.  The rocky ground
continues east and west, while slightly more hospitable foothills lie
northward.
