You stand in a low tunnel walled with rough, black stones.  The ceiling
and floor seem to be made of the same hard coal-like mineral.  The air in
the passage is dead and stale, as if it has been sealed in for centuries. 
No breeze stirs, and sounds seem to be absorbed by the walls almost
immediately, creating an eerie silence all about.  The passage continues

A Black-Stoned Passage~
You stand in a low tunnel walled with rough, black stones.  The ceiling
and floor seem to be made of the same hard coal-like mineral.  The air in
the passage is dead and stale, as if it has been sealed in for centuries. 
No breeze stirs, and sounds seem to be absorbed by the walls almost
immediately, creating an eerie silence all about.  The passage continues
through the darkness, broken once in a while by a branch laying at right
angles with the rest of the passage.

The Path of Fire~
You stand in a fiery pit, circled about by solid walls of white-hot
flames.  The small circle of blackened stone floor is hot to the touch, and
waves of heat from the all-consuming inferno close in, making the area
nearly unbearable.

The Path of Fire~
You stand in the midst of a blazing inferno; all about, white-hot fires
dance and crackle.  There seem to be no ceiling, walls, or floor to this
area, only a thin path of blackened stone, which gives off enormous heat. 
The black stone path twists crazily through the fire, its true direction
seeming to shift at random.

The Path of Fire~
You stand in the midst of a blazing inferno; all about, white-hot fires
dance and crackle.  There seem to be no ceiling, walls, or floor to this
area, only a thin path of blackened stone, which gives off enormous heat. 
The black stone path twists crazily through the fire, its true direction
seeming to shift at random.

A Blackened Stone Platform~
A wide platform of blackened stone stands suspended among the flames, the
hellish heat of the surrounding inferno pressing in at you.  The stone
itself absorbs a great deal of the heat, making it uncomfortable to stand
on.  Great blazing shapes pass by, veiled in the crackling flames.  On the
floor of the platform, a series of odd runes have been carved.

A Dark Corridor~
You stand in the center of a wide hallway with walls of stone.  The air
is dry and filled with a disturbingly alien odor.  Faint whisperings echo
throughout the darkened corridors, accompanied by an occasional rushing
noise, sounding as if a burst of wind had been unleashed in a small room. 
The stone walls themselves are oddly constructed, the angles seeming somehow
wrong.  The hallway comes to an abrupt end at this point.  Feeble,
somewhat-recent etchings sprawl across the stone at the end of the corridor
here.

A Dark Corridor~
You stand in the center of a wide hallway with walls of stone.  The air
is dry and filled with a disturbingly alien odor.  Faint whisperings echo
throughout the darkened corridors, accompanied by an occasional rushing
noise, sounding as if a burst of wind had been unleashed in a small room. 
The stone walls themselves are oddly constructed, the angles seeming somehow
wrong.

You stand in a small, darkened alcove opening to the east.  Through this
arched entrance, an eerie purplish light streams.  A series of blasphemous
runes carved into the stone wall of the alcove are barely visible in the
darkness.  The air seems stifled and lifeless, and a deadly silence reigns.

The Arcanum~
You stand in a small square room hewn from the alien purple stone.  The
walls are crowded with line upon line of mystic runes, and the center of the
floor is dominated by a large circle of symbols which glow a bright violet. 
The ceiling is covered with a bizarre pattern of tiles, indeterminate yet
simultanously disquieting.  

On the western wall, an unsettling symbol extricates itself from the crowded
runes, beckoning your gaze.

symbolvision~
As you study the symbol the runes surrounding it seem to try to crowd it
away, squirming for your attention.  As you make a consious effort to focus,
your awareness of the world about you fades and you find yourself
elsewhere..  

You find yourself in a dark vaulted chamber, barely lit in a sinister red
glow from an unseen source.  Dozens of dark, robed forms surround you, and a
dark, unintelligable murmur echoes throughout the room.  Standing in the
center of the circle they form, you feel their gazes studying you.  Weighing
you.  

One of them steps forward, a flicker of dim red illumination highlighting a
mockery of a human face.  Tight, discolored skin, flashing inhuman eyes and
feral pointed teeth make the visage of the approaching figure.  The murmurs
fall silent with a hiss as the robed thing raises its arm toward you, black
cloth falling away to reveal a slender, clawed hand.  The demonic creature
before you taps a finger to your forehead, and you feel yourself surge with
power.  

You scream in exhultation as you feel the pure power of the void run through
you, more than you thought you could ever channel.  A thousand times more. 
You can feel the arcane powers of death and the daemonic at your beck and
call, flowing through you with viceral coldness.  You pitch back your head,
mad triumphant laughter echoing forth.  Suddenly your head jerks forward as
you feel the power swell still, the infinite nothingness of the void
hollowing your very being with its power.  

With the chilling horror of dawning comprehension you feel your very mind
and soul begin to be sucked into the cold nothingness.  You can only mannage
a pitiful sputter before crumpling to the unyielding stone..  

You suddenly are back in the chamber, the Blasphemous Sigil of Nyogthua
seared into your consiousness.  
~
E
nyogthua~
This sigil is actually composed of several lesser runes of the Void. 
Each of these smaller runes is connected by a stem-like structure, which
bisects the runes collected on either side.  At the base of the mystic sigil
is the Rune of the Arcanum, whose lines serve as the root of the
inscription\@s symbol.  

Dark energies flicker along the lines of the design.  Perhaps with study,
you would learn more.

You stand in a vast corridor of stone, measuring no less than thirty feet

round windows, each the height of an ordinary room.  The windows are glazed,
and latticed with stout-looking bars, but beyond are visible the waving tops
of bizarre fern-like growths.

Before a Darkened Portal~
The dark antechamber continues, the curious seamless walls curving around
the corner of the room.  Set in the wall before you is a portal of jet
blackness, a square of darkness bordered by a line of symbols carved into
the wall.  The antechamber continues to the east and south, the rest of the
room lost in the inky dark.

The Darkened Antechamber~
The alien purplish stone of the hallway deepens and fades into blackness
as the hallway opens into this large antechamber.  The walls of now-black
material are formed seamlessly, flowing smoothly from floor into ceiling and
around the room.  The room seems to absorb light, creating a smoky darkness
all around.  The large chamber seems to be free of decorations, with the
exception of a large statue to the east.  North and south are dark portals
set against the walls.

The Darkened Antechamber~
The dark antechamber continues, the curious seamless walls curving around
to the east end of the room.  This end of the room is dominated by a raised
dais set against the wall.  Carved into the wall behind the dais are a
multitude of twisted figures, pictured dancing and cavorting obscenely.  The
antechamber continues to the north, south, and west, lost in the smoky
darkness.

A Fetid Wasteland~
You stand in the center of a vast, fetid wasteland, with nothing visible
in the distance but slightly curved hills of muck.  The ground is marshy,
wet with an unusual slime that seems to ooze from the spongy earth itself. 
The air is filled with an unbearable stench, smelling of rotting flesh,
fish, and other unnamable things.  The sky overhead is dark and gloomy,
dominated by lead-gray clouds that seem to take unnatural shapes.

Before the Altar of Xiganath~

walls are slanted overhead, and come together directly above to form a
triangular passage.  A small set of black stone steps leads upwards to the

You stand in a broad chamber bathed in an eerie purple glow.  The four
walls of the chamber curve together overhead, forming a low dome-shaped
ceiling.  The stones of the chamber walls are evenly laid black blocks
marbled with luminescent purple, which gives off the unsettling light
filling the room.  Carved into the walls of the chamber are shadowy, twisted
faces, leering in hatred, and the north wall is decorated by a disturbing
tableau of images.  A small set of black steps descends into darkness.

Within a Vast Corridor~
You stand in a vast corridor of stone, measuring no less than thirty feet
from side to side.  The floor of the hallway is inclined, sloping upwards to
the north.  Set into the north, east, and west walls are enormous arched
doors of brown stone, each appearing to be twice the height of an ordinary
room.  The door to the east is slightly ajar; the north and west doors
appear completely immovable.

Within a Vast Chamber~
You stand in an enormous vaulted chamber whose ceiling is lost in the
shadows overhead.  Vast shelves of dark wood line the stone walls, holding
what seem to be volumes of immense size with strange hieroglyphs on their
backs.  There are no chairs, but rather vast pedastals littered with books,
papers, and what seem to be writing materials.  The brown stone walls of the
chamber are lined with curving mathematical designs, and there are chiselled
inscriptions in the same characters the books bear.  A huge vaulted door
leading to the west stands slightly ajar.

The black stone stairs lead down into a small chamber beneath the shrine
itself.  The walls here are built of entirely black stone, and although a
small portion of the eerie purple light trickles in, for the most part
darkness reigns.  Three small alcoves are built into the north, east, and
south walls of the chamber.

The Chamber of the Maze~
This chamber would be pitch black, but is illuminated by a pale, wan
glow, emanating from a tortured and convoluted mystical symbol burned into
the floor.  The walls, floor, and ceiling of the chamber are chiseled from a
black stone, whose uniform shade makes distinguish anything other than the
symbol difficult.  A stone stairwell leads upwards from the chamber, leaving
through a jagged hole above into darkness.

The Maze is a convoluted arrangement of angular strokes, with an overall
structure which is reminiscent of a complex labyrinth.  At the nexuses of
the lines of the maze, dark runes are scattered.  To even the most casual
inspection, the runes sit like traps, snaring those attempting to trace the
paths of the maze.  

Against your will, you begin attempting a path through the maze.  You stare
at it blankly, lost in its depths....  

Pulpy, dark tissue surrounds you in the shape of a corridor.  Heedless of
reason, you flee, moving with a speed born of stark terror.  

Tentacles ooze from the walls of the place, grabbing at you, slowing your
flight.  Bulbous eyes and maws form as well, jeering and ogling your
progress.  A slithering echo follows your steps, and your irrational terror
takes tangible form.  

Time seems to stand still, as you cannot find your way out of the fleshy
maze.  The horrors multiply, until the walls open in a vast chamber...  A
vast CATHEDRAL of flesh.  

The chamber drips with viscous fluids, and the place is alive with whipping
and twisting appendages.  Pools of acid burble and hiss, and a dark stair
rises to the center of the chamber.  

And there, in the middle of this place, is the tentacled, writhing body of
Isetaton, Demon Sultan.  Even the barest brush of its awareness sends you
screaming to your knees, groveling before its dark power.  Daring another
glimpse of It, you realize that Isetaton is a part of the organic horror
that is the maze.  

Flee him, Seek him, both are one, for your mind is trapped in Isetaton\@s.  



Your vision clears, and you are left with the conviction that the Maze of
Isetaton is a part of you.

taper beside it.

The First Altar~
Here there is no uncertainty.  You are within an unspeakably vast abyss,
and the void bears down on you with all the crushing infinitude of its cold
emptiness.  Somewhere nearby, there stands a great altar, surrounded by a
circle of obsidian idols.

E
xthjich~
Xthjich, the Eternal Demon, stands tall upon the black altar, darkly
resplendent in his spiked armor.  Long and terrible are his claws and fangs,
dreadful his power in the dark.  
~
E
agduk~
Agduk, the Scion of Xthjich, crouches by the altar, a great bow slung
across his scarred back, and at his waist a horn bound with hoops of iron. 
A cunning stalker of the shadows, and a hunter bringing fear by night.  
~
E
pricina~
Pricina, Queen of the Succubi, stands by the altar, arms outstretched in
wanton yearning.  Achingly desirable is her silk-shrouded form, freezing and
poisonous her touch.  
~
E
tzakmeqiel~
Tzakmeqiel, the Desecratrix, lies prostrate before the altar, surrounded
by a fine webwork of moldering cracks.  Plague, decay, and miasma are the
keepsakes of her passage.  
~
E
igray\@iitu~
Igray\@iitu, Lord of Oame, sits before the altar, grinning a slimy
toad-grin over his distended belly.  Fecund and pestilential, a prince of
creeping things, his hunger is insatiable.  
~
E
khamurn~
Khamurn, Magistrate of the Void, stands proud before the altar, draped in
thick brocade heavy with gold and jewels.  His jet eyes gleam with avarice,
and the law succours not his victims.  
~
E
barkja~
Barkja, the Infernal Stage, stands in humble robes before the altar,
chained to a ponderous tome.  Fathomless is his knowledge, inscrutable his
aims, inexhaustible his patience.  
~
E
bahhaoth~
Bahhaoth, Queen of the Dead Seas, reposes upon a small plinth by the
altar.  Lurid and horrible is her gleam.  Penetrating and irresistable is
her gaze.  Violent and complete is her wrath.  
~
E
isetaton~
Isetaton, the Demon Sultan, watches by the altar, tentacles gathered
beneath his finery like the roots of an evil tree.  Hot and twisted are the
paths of the Maze of Flesh.  Flee, flee the Maze of Flesh!  
~
E
nyogthua~
Nyogthua, the Wizard of the Arcanum, broods before the altar, obsidian
face hidden beneath a cowl of weird runes.  As deep and dark as the Void is
his wisdom, and his vengeance endures forever.  
~
E
an\@akarta~
An\@Akarta, the Flame of Logor, stands at attention before the altar,
blazing with unfettered rage.  Like hellfire burns his anger, and never can
it be appeased until not even the ashes of its object remain.  
~
E
ashur empty~
The last place around the altar is empty, save for the awful name of
{bASHUR{x.  
~
E
vaeshir~
The ebony skull of Vaeshir, Grand Vizier of Logor, regards the altar. 
Iron is the Black City, and iron the will of its ruler.  In his plots and
schemes mortals are crushed as by the gears of a vast machine.

A Fiery Pit~
You stand in a fiery pit, circled about by solid walls of white-hot
flames.  The small circle of blackened stone floor is hot to the touch, and
waves of heat from the all-consuming inferno close in, making the area
nearly unbearable.
