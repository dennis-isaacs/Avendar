the lkura\@ij~
A giant caterpillar-like horror, the lkura\@ij lolls amidst the treasure.
~
By all appearances a gigantic caterpillar with a carapace composed
alternatingly of dark chitin and bloated flesh, the lkura\@ij splays itself
obscenely across the room.  Hundreds upon hundreds of tiny, barb-tipped legs
line its underside, all clattering against the coin and gold beneath them
creating a horrible din.  At the head of its horrific body is a relatively
small head.  There, a pair of acid-dripping mandibles flank a lipless human
mouth.  The eyes of the lkura\@ij seem to be orbs formed of pure,
mirror-finished platinum, reflecting wickedly all it sees.

a Logorin taskmaster~
A mass of black-fleshed muscle, a Logorian taskmaster glares sternly.
~
A hideous being of twisted, veined muscle lurches here, radiating a sense
of power and authority.  Its skin is a sickly, glazed black, and dotted with
faint scarring remnants of sores.  Its entire front bulges outwards with
hairless muscle, scarred with scabbed-over wounds of various size and depth.
Its arms, thick and powerful, extend from his sides, each clutching a
several-headed whip of razor-sharp barbs and thin-wired tips.  Its lower
body descends into two potent-looking limbs of the same black flesh, which
hook backwards in a way similar to that of a goat.  

His head is a most horrific perversion of nature itself.  Thick and bulbous,
it embodies the characteristics of an assortment of animal-forms, and yet
never seems to decide on one for certain.  Instead, the form of the head
twists and writhes upon itself, removing eyes, replacing snouts, and closing
over gills continously as it glares about its surroundings.  Although never
settling upon a single form for more than an instant, one thing is constant;
the taskmaster\@s visage remains hideous in the extreme.

This heavy tome is bound in overlapping fragments of thickly wrinkled

wrinkles are stained dark, as are most of the pages of the tome.  Upon
closer inspection, it appears that most of the pages are clotted together. 
Only a few pages toward the center of the tome and one at the end are still

LAST of these remaining pages.  
~
E
first~
And the blood of the First of the Children of Clay, those who have
fallen, and for whom no rising cometh, will stain the scrivener\@s hand.  

   Thus may the martial lords of the City of Dream and Void be called 
   unto thee, pacted and bound by tools of war

   Thus may the Sage Infernal be summoned forth from the Library Which 
   Endeth Not, by that which the Hexagon guardeth

   And only thus may the Hunger Beyond Hunger be bound unto thee, drawn 
   from the Labyrinth and glutted on the entrails of man or beast
~
E
second~
And the blood of the Angelic Hosts, Lords of the Celestial Spheres, those
who see not, and whose blindness bringeth our ruin, shall be thine ink.  

   Thus may the Daughters of Pain be called unto thee, and pacted and 
   bound by thine own life.

   Thus may the Hunter be called into thy favour, summoned by the 
   Eye of his father, and bound by blades of might and renown.

   And only thus may the Lords of Many Slaves be made slaves in turn, 
   though thou shalt wieldeth the whip not in thy mastery! but instead 
   bind thy slave with its gifting, just as he bindeth thine.
~
E
third~
And the blood of the Children of the Goddess, She who Bringeth the Light
Unseeing, will wet thy blade, thine hands and thy stylus.  

   Thus may spirits unclean wash away the stain of Her coming, summoned 
   from the Night Eternal by the secrets of the Lord of the Arcanum, 
   and pacted and bound by the mind\@s dead shell
~
E
fourth~
And the blood which spilleth last, for its spilling begets ending, is
thine own.  It shall flow in accordance with thine will.  

   Thus may the Simulcra of Dead Chaigia be called unto thee by the 
   Mark of She Who Dwelleth in the Unliving Depths

   Thus may the Worm Which Eateth Souls be called from womb of She 
   Who Stealeth Hearts, pacted and bound with the mind\@s dead shell

   And only thus may the Many-Eyed Acolytes of the Sage Infernal be
   called unto thee, to bargain the mysteries sublime for that which 
   is mundane and yet not mundane, the works of man woven with occult 
   force.

The last page of the tome is scrawled with a complex arcane script,

golden statue hand hands obj_7749~
This statue of a human being is disturbingly lifelike.  The slender human
is formed in incredible detail entirely from gold, from individual
moustache-hairs to the folds of his cloth.  An expression of intense pain
disfigures the statue\@s face, and in its hands it holds a golden orb.  The
statue is frozen in mid-motion, as though trying to cast away the orb.

a soulsilver medallion~
A small intricate medallion of glossy, polished metal is here.~
Some scholars believe that beings of the void have little use for
material wealth and that usage of coins is absent within their realm. 
However, the trading of demons between void lords was known to be common. 
This was difficult to manage, dangerous to oversee, and messy to clean up
when things went wrong.  Consequently, the blasphemous substance known
colloquially as \@soulsilver\@ came into existence.  The power of the void
magic within the gems adorning the center of these medallions was strong
enough to bind lesser demons into them.  It is also not far-fetched that
some medallions were even used to contain mortal souls who had traded their
lives for some diabolic power, for they are highly delightful to demons.

sensations.  You owe me a great deal for this, Ylthin, do not forget it. 
I\@m sure there will be occasion to repay my diligence some night soon.  

To singe one armored in metal, even though they be somewhat at a distance,
build for yourself a pyre tinged in red.  Burn within it armoring formed of
steel, then an armament of the same.  To disperse the effect widely, you
must then finish the ritual with a flask full of water.  The results are
particularly delightful when unsuspecting \@allies\@ are at your side; you
will almost be able to taste their discomfiture.  

Use it well, and do not forget -- you are in my debt.

A Dark Hallway in the Temple~
The dark hallway branches north from the large chamber, leading to the
Altar of Hate.  The walls of the hallway are carved with bas-relief images
of demonic faces, leering at you from all directions.  Flaming braziers fill
the hallway with smoke and heat.

A Dark Hallway in the Temple~
The dark hallway leads deeper into the bowels of the temple, curving its
way toward the Altar of Pain.  The black stone walls of the passage are
decorated with various implements of torture--curved blades, spiked
apparatuses, and tools for crushing and slicing.  The tiles of the floor are
broken and so arranged that the sharp edges cut into the feet of anyone
walking here.  Bits of flesh are stuck to the tiles, and dried blood cakes
the floor.  From the east, shrieks of agony are audible.

You awaken standing before the High Priest in Yithoul, your mind still
reeling in the new depths revealed to you, and the Vkoren Configuration
indelibly imprinted in your mind.  
~
E
symbolvision5~
Your head swims as you attempt to wrap your mind around these
newly-glimpsed dimensions; dimensions which require new perspectives on time
and knowledge, presence and absence, as well as a rewriting of your
understanding of space.  The confusion becomes vertigo, and the vertigo soon
develops into an overwhelming pain.  Long before you can truly grasp the
implications of the pattern, you black out.  
~
E
symbolvision4~
The next thing you know, you\@re standing before the lectern, staring down
at the opened page of the tome.  Intricately scribed on a thick, fibrous
parchment is a design of baffling complexity.  At first it appears to be a
set of interlocking triangles of different shapes and sizes.  It then
becomes clear that, through a mastery of perspective, all of the triangles
are perfect equalaterals of exactly the same size.  Their initial
differences come from varied facings and depths, somehow rendered through
alteration of the widths of their sides and their apparent angles.  As you
settle into admiration of this peculiar work, it occurs to you that there is
something deeply wrong with the arrangement.  Triangles are linked where no
joining should be possible, lines pass over lines where they should pass
under, by any sane geometry, and the entire space represented seems
insufficient to hold the design.  More than an optical illusion, the
configuration suggests some underlying rhyme and logic, as though the
addition of extra dimensions would render the structure intelligible.  
~
E
symbolvision3~
This sobering thought weighs upon your mind as you step from between two
bookshelves into a more open, hexagonal area.  The walls of the space are
also formed from bookshelves and archways open its six sides, leading to yet
more corridors of bookshelves in all directions.  Yet it is the center of
the hexagon to which your attention is drawn, where a high stone lectern
holds an open tome.  
~
E
symbolvision2~
Innumerable volumes clutter the shelves, ordered only so far as their
disparate media and many languages allow.  Heavy, leather-bound tomes jostle
with loose folios of yellowed parchment, and cracked and dessicated scrolls
are gently arrayed alongside graven sheets of charcoal-coloured slate. 
These works are scribed in languages both familiar and wholly alien.  All of
the sentient races of Avendar seem to have contributed wisdom to this
magnificent library, and yet most of the works are unreadable.  Outnumbering
the mortal texts by far are those scribed in the infernal alphabets of the
the denizens of the Void.  Varied as the Void is vast, most scripts seem to
symbolize sounds unutterable by the mortal throat, and in many cases,
thought processes alien to the mortal mind.  From beautiful and convoluted
cursive streams, designed to be read in some non-linear fashion, to insolent
columns of angular hieroglyphs, manifestly the product of some deeply
violent race.  Unbreachable walls of knowledge surround you, and it is with
a spasm of lurching dismay that your own meager quest for knowledge is
placed in perspective.

symbolvision1~
At first you see nothing but darkness, and feel nothing but a musty chill
air which seems to cling to you skin.  You take a few tentative steps, if
only to shake off the dry, stale air.  The floor is of wide, rounded
cobbles, hard and reassuring beneath your feet.  As you walk, shapes begin
to resolve themselves from the darkness.  Layered horizontal lines form some
sort of corridor, extending as high and as far as you can see.  It soon
becomes clear that these horizontal lines are shelves, and that the corridor
is a passage between bookcases.  The complete darkness of moments ago is
broken now with the faint, red glimmers of candle or lantern light, burning
at points so far distant that their flamelights are dimmed and blurred into
hazy motes.  At long intervals, archways open in the bookshelves,
silhouetted by the ambient glow.  These archways lead to yet more corridors
in what appears to be a library of unthinkable proportions.

The Chamber of Greed~
The Chamber of Greed spreads before you to the south and west.  The room
of Greed is a rich chamber, filled with fine furniture, rare sculptures,
paintings and other objects of wealth that have been plundered from the
shuddeni conquests over the centuries.  In the southwest corner of the room
stands the Altar, piled high with riches.  A large inscription on the wall
of the chamber reads, \#Woe to ye who would pilfer the treasure from this
chamber, for your lives are forfeit.\#

The Chamber of Power~
The black walls of the Chamber of Power have been lined with plates of
onyx, and are engraved with magical runes of great power.  These runes glow
and pulse in the darkness, humming with the energy controlled by the
shuddeni magicians.  Placed about the Chamber are steel lecturns holding
spell books, magic components, and items used in rituals of power.  The
shuddeni priests come to this chamber to study, increasing their power over
the spheres and in turn their power over their fellow beings.  To the east,
the Altar of Power hums with great energy.

At the Altar of Power~
The Altar of Power is a pitch-black cube of negative energy, emitting a
low humming noise.  Nothing rests on this Altar, and indeed all objects have
been moved away from it.  It is here that the shuddeni priests come to
commune with the dark mystic powers that they wield, and to practice and
experiment with new malevolent enchantments.  The walls of the surrounding
chamber are lined with plates of black onyx, inscribed with powerful runes
that glow in the darkness.

enters this Void will not return.

The Chamber of Fire~
The Chamber of Fire is a large room filled with flames.  The floor and
walls seems to be entirely afire, and long fingers of flame shoot forth,
singing and burning.  Entirely smokeless and with no apparent fuel, the
room\@s flame appears to be magical in nature.  To the northeast burns a
raging inferno, its white heat the most intense you can imagine.  Surely
anything that came in contact with that hellish flame would be instantly
consumed.

The Temple Torture Chamber~
The black stone bricks of this room are pitted and chipped, as if it has
seen more than its share of violence.  Splashes of blood along the walls
provide further evidence of unpleasantness.  The chamber has been fitted
with iron manacles along the walls, and leg irons nearer to the floor. 
Gutters built into the floor lead to slits in the stone, apparently designed
to drain any spilled blood.  Bits of hair and flesh are caked onto the
stones of the chamber.

A Narrow Stairway~
The narrow stairway winds through the darkness, leading upward toward the
Temple of Yithoul, or descending deeper into the earth.  The limestone walls
of the stairway suddenly change at this point, as the passage descends into
a large vein of black basalt.  The slightly porous rock is warm to the
touch, and has been polished to a fine glow, reflecting any light.

The Lair of the Lkura\@Ij~
The walls of this massive chamber are forged of shining gold, each
engraved with great murals depicting scenes of indugence and wealth.  This
golden chamber seems to be the lair of some great creature by its
dimensions.  Silver, gold and platinum coins litter the floor, piling up
toward the corners of the room.  Mixed in with the coins, various objects of
art and jewelry lie.  

A fine layer of sticky ichor covers the massed wealth, smelling of putrified
flesh.

As you study the Crest of Khamurn, images flicker at the edges of your
consiousness.  

Wealth.  Gold.  Visions of riches and luxury flit through your mind
unbidden.  Treasure beyond imagination flows about you in a great shining
river, the gleaming coins beckoning.  You feel yourself sink beneath the
sparkling metal waves, the stream of wealth flowing over you.  Suffocating
you.  Crushing you.  You struggle to move, to breathe, only to have the sea
of shining metal pin you with riches and have your mouth and lungs filled
with sparkling copper.  

You feel the weight of the coins crushing the life from you and struggle to
get a final scream from your breathless lungs..  

You suddenly jerk back into reality, the Crest of Khamurn burned into your
mind.

A Passage through the Darkness~
At first you see nothing but darkness, and feel nothing but a musty chill
air which seems to cling to you skin.  You take a few tentative steps, if
only to shake off the dry, stale air.  The floor is of wide, rounded
cobbles, hard and reassuring beneath your feet.  As you walk, shapes begin
to resolve themselves from the darkness.  Layered horizontal lines form some
sort of corridor, extending as high and as far as you can see.  It soon
becomes clear that these horizontal lines are shelves, and that the corridor
is a passage between bookcases.

A Vast Library~
The complete darkness of moments ago is broken now with the faint, red
glimmers of candle or lantern light, burning at points so far distant that
their flamelights are dimmed and blurred into hazy motes.  At long
intervals, archways open in the bookshelves, silhouetted by the ambient
glow.  These archways lead to yet more corridors in what appears to be a
library of unthinkable proportions.

A Vast Library~
Innumerable volumes clutter the shelves, ordered only so far as their
disparate media and many languages allow.  Heavy, leather-bound tomes jostle
with loose folios of yellowed parchment, and cracked and dessicated scrolls
are gently arrayed alongside graven sheets of charcoal-coloured slate. 
These works are scribed in languages both familiar and wholly alien.  All of
the sentient races of Avendar seem to have contributed wisdom to this
magnificent library, and yet most of the works are unreadable.  Outnumbering
the mortal texts by far are those scribed in the infernal alphabets of the
the denizens of the Void.  Varied as the Void is vast, most scripts seem to
symbolize sounds unutterable by the mortal throat, and in many cases,
thought processes alien to the mortal mind.  From beautiful and convoluted
cursive streams, designed to be read in some non-linear fashion, to insolent
columns of angular hieroglyphs, manifestly the product of some deeply
violent race.  Unbreachable walls of knowledge surround you, and it is with
a spasm of lurching dismay that your own meager quest for knowledge is
placed in perspective.

A Hexagonal Chamber in the Library~
You step from between two bookshelves into a more open, hexagonal area. 
The walls of the space are also formed from bookshelves and archways open in
each of its six sides, leading to yet more corridors and more bookshelves in
all directions.  Yet it is to the center of the hexagon that your attention
is drawn, where a high stone lectern holds an open tome.  A design of
baffling complexity is scribed on the thick, fibrous parchment of the opened
page.

You awaken standing before the High Priest in Yithoul, your mind still
reeling in the new depths revealed to you, and the Vkoren Configuration
indelibly imprinted on your mind.  
~
E
symbolvision~
Your head swims as you attempt to wrap your mind around these
newly-glimpsed dimensions; dimensions which require new perspectives on time
and knowledge, presence and absence, as well as a rewriting of your
understanding of space.  Just as you begin to make some small sense of these
bizarre configurations, your confusion develops into vertigo, and the
vertigo soon develops into an overwhelming pain.  Long before you can truly
grasp the implications of the pattern, you black out...  
~
E
lectern~
This high, stone lectern, carved from a single piece of black granite,
holds an enormous, leather-bound tome, which lies open.  
~
E
parchment~
At first the design within this tome appears to be a simple set of
interlocking triangles of different shapes and sizes.  It then becomes clear
that, through a mastery of perspective, all of the triangles are perfect
equalaterals of exactly the same size.  Their initial differences come from
varied facings and depths, somehow rendered through alteration of the widths
of their sides and their apparent angles.  As you settle into admiration of
this peculiar work, it occurs to you that there is something deeply wrong
with the arrangement.  Triangles are linked where no joining should be
possible, lines pass over lines where they should pass under, by any sane
geometry, and the entire space represented seems insufficient to hold the
design.  More than an optical illusion, the configuration suggests some
underlying rhyme and logic, as though the addition of extra dimensions would
render the structure intelligible.  
You think, perhaps, that by studying the symbol, you might come to
understand its mysteries.
