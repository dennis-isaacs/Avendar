golem statue large granite granitegolem~
the granite golem~
A large granite statue of a man is here.
~
At first appearing to be no more than a large granite statue, slight
movements reveal that this is in fact a magical construct, a huge golem made
of granite.  Its construction appears to be of the highest workmanship, and
its sculpting is unusually well-done.  Its large stone fists have crystals
embedded in them.

a granite golem~
A large granite statue of a man is here.
~
At first appearing to be no more than a large granite statue, slight
movements reveal that this is in fact a magical construct, a huge golem made
of granite.  Its construction appears to be of the highest workmanship, and
its sculpting is unusually well-done.  Its large stone fists have crystals
embedded in them.

The ancient forest spirit is a truly terrifying sight.  Its enormous
serpentine body writhes and slides through the shrubs and bushes of the
garden area, moving with a quick grace that indicates an ability to dart
like lightning if need be.  Leafy vines sprout from its back, and moss
covers it formidable armor of scales.  Long greenish teeth are visible in
its powerful jaws.

like a persistent mange.  Smoky red orbs sit in the hen\@s eye sockets,
rotating with ominous precision toward its prey.  Most sinister, though, is
the beak, which is more jagged maw than anything else.  It opens and snaps
the jaws periodically, revealing a twisting and serpentine tongue.

A golem made from clanking sheets of tin stands here.

This golem is made from sheets of tin, connected with a motley
arrangement of magic and rope.  Almost violently irregular, none of the
individual sheets which constitute the golem are of the same size, shape, or
even color.  The plates bang and clatter together as the thing moves,
apparently heedless of its odd construction.

wand wonder~
the Wand of Wonder~
The Wand of Wonder lies here.~
The Wand of Wonder is an extremely potent magical artifact, rumored to
have either been discovered or invented by the infamous archmage Zilba
Gralci.  Almost certainly created using powerful, ancient magic, the wands
most notable feature is the mystic gemstone on its tip.  

Known to be a shard of the heart of a polychromatic dragon of crystalline
genus, it is capable of channeling magic of all elements or none.  Such
dragons are so rare and powerful that typically they only fall prey to
groups of elemental lords, demigods, or other dragons of similar ilk.  How a
piece of the heart of such a being came to be bound up into a wand remains a
mystery, but the potency it lends the artifact is undeniable.  

Stories occasionally speak of wands such as this (or perhaps there is simply
this one wand), but a full accounting of their powers remains elusive.  No
two tales can agree on a single power for the wand, perhaps indicating that
multiple effects are possible, given the right circumstances.  What IS known
about the wand is that it has been present for the defeat of numerous
powerful and dangerous beings but appears equally in the hands of great
heroes who met with tragic ends.

The Iceroom~
The iceroom is a large storage room notable for its sub-freezing
temperatures and the thick layers of frost and ice that coat the walls,
floor and ceiling.  Large metal hooks protrude from the walls and ceilings,
used to hang slabs of meat for storage.  A massive metal door is set into
the north wall.

The Iceroom~
The iceroom continues, the layers of frost and ice coating the walls
growing thicker and thicker toward the west end of the cold-storage area. 
The thick ice on the floor has been clawed and dug to form an indented area
that appears to be a giant animal\@s resting place.

You stand on a small landing of stone, furnished with an expensively
woven rug and several bookcases.  The shelves of the bookcases are lined
with glass jars, each of which contains a bizarre specimen of some sort.  A
stone stairway leads upward to the north, from whence flickering lights,
burbling sounds, and odd smells seem to be coming.

This area is obviously used as a laboratory, as it is lined with shelves,

cauldrons, and other more bizarre things, all apparently constituting
experiments of diverse nature.  Burbling and hissing noises abound, and
occasional flashes of light from crystals, jars, or pots add to the chaos.

A Guest Room~
The door to this guest room opens into what appears to be thin air, high
in the clouds.  The floor is solid enough, but to all appearances it is
composed of nothing more than the white mist of a billowing cloud.  Other
clouds crawl across the blue sky above, and a stirring wind blows through
the room.

A Guest Room~
This large guest bedroom appears even larger than its actual size, due to
the diminutive furniture it has been supplied with.  A small bed, no longer
than four feet, bears sheets of fine silk, and a warm down blanket.  Hung on
the wall is a large tapestry depicting a variety of bizarre landscapes.

nearby.  Any footfalls are nearly silent on the luxuriously carpeted floor,

This small room is located at the top of a high tower.  Large windows
built into the stone walls give a view outside the tower, but almost all of

stonework of the palace can be seen through the clouds.

Far below, a small garden is visible.

The Gullet of a Demonic Hen~
The gullet of the demonic hen is a place of dripping acid and grinding
edges.  Pools of burning black ichor sizzle underfoot, continually renewed
by dripping protuberances which hang from the ceiling like fleshy
stalagmites.  The fleshy walls are covered with blunted spines, which
periodically contract in order to grind the contents of the gullet into
digestable chunks.  No signs of exit are visible from this fleshy prison.

You find yourself in a giant vault filled with mounds of bones and

source.  The air is exceedingly foul and stale, as if this vault has been

An unending field of ice and snow surrounds you on all sides.  The only

cut right through to your bones, and it carries with it savage ice crystals
that lacerate your skin.

The Enchanted Grove~
The southwest corner of the garden consists of a grove of tall trees
spaced evenly throughout the area.  Although many are saplings, several of
the trees appear to be true forest giants, ancients of their kind.  A soft
breeze whispers through the limbs of the trees, creating a soothing natural
backdrop to the creakings of the branches.  At the southwest end of the
grove, a shimmering wall of crystal edges the area.

You are falling slowly in midair, buffeted about by strong gusts of wind.
Nearby you can see a tall, slender tower built of stone, and below you can
see a small garden.  All else below is covered in mist.  The sky seems to
consist entirely of distant clouds crawling slowly by.
