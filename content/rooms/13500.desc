Rnum 13500
Desc Erected high above the ground, this tent provides a view out over the
savannah below.  The tent is constructed from a thick red material, which is
held up with pillars of air.  Maps and charts litter the tent, covering the
top of a large desk which stands against one wall of the tent and lying in
small piles in various other locations.  To the south, the entrance of the
tent provides access to the savannah below.
