Desc Rows upon rows of leafy green vines stretch east to west, parallel to the
shoreline beyond the low stone wall to the north.  The ground slopes down in
gentle steps toward the wall, giving the vineyard a tiered landscape.  The
leafy vines encircle and nearly conceal the thin support fences they rest
upon.
